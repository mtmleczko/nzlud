PREFACE 
    This volume is a republication of the 1987 Code of the City of Hurst, Texas. The original arrangement and the original numbering system have been retained. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Municipal Code Corporation and the City of Hurst, Texas. 1998. 
    The following paragraphs are reprinted from the preface of the 1987 Code: 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Hurst of a general and permanent nature. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1965 City Code, as supplemented through December 11, 1984, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1965 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together have been included. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the seventh section of Chapter 6 is 6-7. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 7-2 and 7-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 7-2.1, 7-2.2 and 7-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 4 and 5, it will be designated as Chapter 4.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
The general index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publishers are most grateful to Mr. George A. Staples, Jr., City Attorney, and Ms. Pat Evans, City Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

(4)  Divide the number of Part I crimes occurring at the multi-family dwelling within the preceding twelve (12) months by the actual occupancy number and multiply the result by "100" to produce the community per capita crime index for Part I crimes; 
(5)  Divide the number of Part II crimes occurring at the multi-family dwelling within the preceding twelve (12) months by the actual occupancy number and multiply the result by "100" to produce the community per capita crime index for Part II crimes; and 
(6)  Divide the number of Chapter 125 crimes occurring at the multi-family dwelling within the preceding twelve (12) months by the actual occupancy number and multiply the result by "100" to produce the community per capita crime index for Chapter 125 crimes. 
(c)  Example of calculation of community per capita crime index. 
Numbers for Example: 
Apartment size: 100 units 
Apartment occupancy rate: 90% occupied 
Apartment crime in 12-month period: 
10 Part I Crimes; 
20 Part II Crimes; 
15 Chapter 125 Crimes 
Apartment-unit mix: 70 one-bedrooms; 30 two-bedrooms 
Total bedrooms: 130 
Example Calculations: 
Ideal occupancy number = 130 x 2 = 260 (with two occupants counted for each bedroom) 
Actual occupancy number = 260 x 90% = 234 
Community Per Capita Crime Index for Part I Crimes = (10 ÷ 234 = 0.0427) x 100 = 4.3 
Community Per Capita Crime Index for Part II Crimes = (20 ÷ 234 = 0.08547) x 100 = 8.5 
Community Per Capita Crime Index for Chapter 125 Crimes = (15 ÷ 234 = 0.0641) x 100 = 6.4 
(Ord. No. 2194, § 3, 2-28-12) 
Sec. 5-402. - Crime risk threshold. 
(a)  The police chief shall collectively calculate on a monthly basis the crime risk threshold for all licensed multi-family dwelling in the city. 
(b)  The crime risk threshold for multi-family dwelling is calculated as follows: 
(1)  Determine the total number of licensed multi-family dwellings in the city. 
(2)  Add together each multi-family dwelling's community per capita crime index for Part I crimes and divide the sum by the total number of licensed multi-family dwelling to produce the average crime index for Part I crimes. 
(3)  Subtract each multi-family dwelling's community per capita crime index for Part I crimes from the average crime index for Part I crimes to get the multi-family dwelling's deviation from the average crime index for Part I crimes. 
(4)  Add the square of each multi-family dwelling's deviation from the average crime index for Part I crimes together and divide the sum by the total number of licensed multi-family dwelling to produce the average squared deviation for Part I crimes. 
(5)  Take the square root of the average squared deviation for Part I crimes and add it to the average crime index for Part I crimes to produce the crime risk threshold for Part I crimes. 
(6)  Repeat the process using each multi-family dwelling's Part II crimes and Chapter 125 crimes to determine the crime risk threshold for Part II crimes and Chapter 125 crimes, respectively. 
(c)  Example of calculation of crime risk threshold. 
Apartment Complex No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 SUM Part I crimes 12 9 3 10 12 22 7 11 15 19 120 Deviation from average community per capita crime index 0 -3 -9 -2 0 10 -5 -1 3 7 0 Deviation squared 0 9 81 4 0 100 25 1 9 49 278  
Average Community Per Capita Crime Index for Part I Crimes = 120 ÷ 10 = 12 
Average squared deviation = 278 ÷ 10 = 27.8 
Standard deviation = v27.8 = 5.27 
Crime Risk Threshold for Part I Crimes = 12 + 5.27 = 17.27 
(Note: To calculate the crime risk threshold for Part II crimes repeat the formula using the number of Part II crimes. For Chapter 125 crimes, repeat the formula using the number for Chapter 125 crimes.)

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 9-1. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provisions of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one (1) percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one (1) percent change of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year-also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor sub grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building: 
(1)  Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water; and 
(2)  Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, elevated building also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate in the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE or V, elevated building also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of elevated building, even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Elevation certificate . All elevation requirements noted in this chapter shall be documented using the Elevation certificate, FEMA 81-31, or latest version, and shall be certified by a registered professional engineer, surveyor, or architect and shall be submitted to the floodplain administrator. All elevation certificates are required to include photographs in the city. 
    Enclosure means an enclosure is a fully enclosed area below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building accesses or storage in an area other than a basement. 
    Existing construction means, for the purpose of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMS effective before that date. Existing construction may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended, and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodplain administrator . The floodplain administrator shall be a certified floodplain administrator (CFM) within the first year of such title. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. This applies also to communities with mapped AO zones. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure; usually an earthen embankment designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closures and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Low cost accessory structure means a structure may be considered "low cost" if it is valued less than three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) and/or would not require an accessory structure permit (i.e., less than one hundred twenty (120) square feet). 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Nonresidential structure includes, but is not limited to: small business concerns, churches, schools, farm buildings (including grain bins and silos), poolhouses, clubhouses, recreational buildings, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, hotels and motels with normal room rentals for less than six (6) months' duration and nursing homes. 
    Reasonably safe from flooding means base flood waters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the SFHA and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means a regulatory floodway shall be selected and adopted based on the principal that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that one (1) percent chance flood at any point. 
    Repetitive loss means flood related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Residential structure is one that is considered to be a domicile or is used for residential purposes for six (6) months or more. Residential structures include a single family home, multiple unit apartment buildings, a residential condominium, or a manufactured or modular home. 
    Special flood hazard area . See Area of special flood hazard. 
    Small accessory structure may be considered "small" if it is below the threshold for a permit (i.e., one hundred twenty (120) square feet). 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage . A structure shall be deemed substantially damaged when the cumulative costs of the improvements or damage repairs, when combined incrementally over a ten-year period of time, equal or exceed forty (40) percent of the market value of the structure. Substantial damage also means flood related damage sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. A structure shall be deemed substantially improved when the cumulative costs of the improvements or damage repairs, when combined incrementally over a ten-year period of time, equal or exceed forty (40) percent of the market value of the structure. 
    For the purpose of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
    The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. The term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) [of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations] is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-2. - Applicability of chapter. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the planning jurisdiction of the City of Hurst. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-3. - Establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Hurst" dated September 25, 2009, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) and flood boundary floodway maps (FBFM) and any revision thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-4. - Development permit required. 
    A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-5. - Compliance with chapter. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-6. - Abrogation; greater restrictions to prevail. 
    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another one conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-7. - Interpretation of provisions. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the city; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-8. - Warning; disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Secs. 9-9-9-25. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 9-26. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of the destruction in floodplains which cause an increase in flood height and velocity, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-27. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief effort associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains; electric telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood-blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area including-SFHA, floodway, zone, and an explanation of what this means by real estate agents with regard to properties located in the City of Hurst. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-28. - Flood loss reduction methods. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter will: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other developments which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

(a)  The city council shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The city council shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the city floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(f)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the relevant factors in section 9-43(b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (see section 9-27). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(j)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in section 9-44(a) through (i) are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(k)  Variances may be issued for the rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

Sec. 9-65. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard, established in section 9-3, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
a.  The drilling of water, gas, and/or oil wells is prohibited from within the boundaries of the regulatory floodway or floodplain as delineated on the community's FIRM. 
b.  Fill material of any kind is prohibited within the regulatory floodway as delineated on the community's FIRM. 
c.  The storage of hazardous materials, in any form, is prohibited within the boundaries of the regulatory floodway and floodplain as delineated on the community's FIRM provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by section 65.12. 
(2)  If subsection (1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR, chapter 1, section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-66. - Emergency access. 
    In order to protect people and property, it is required that new construction or substantially improved structures provide:

(2)  The lowest floor of a residential structure that is outside of the SFHA shall be elevated six (6) inches above the natural grade or the crown of the road, whichever is higher. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-67. - Specific fill requirements. 
    In order to protect people and property, it is required that new construction or substantially improved structures provide: 
(1)  When fill or any other development are placed in the SFHA that have the effect of reducing the storage volume of flood waters in the SFH, then an equal amount of storage volume must be created in another location of the same SFHA to compensate for the storage capacity lost. 
(2)  If fill material is to be used to elevate any structure in zones A, A1-30, AE, AO, AH, AR, or A99, the following will apply: 
a.  Fill material must be compacted to at least ninety-five (95) percent of Standard Laboratory Maximum Density (Standard Proctor) according to ASTM Standard D-698; 
b.  Fill soils must be fine grained soils of low permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC, or ML, according to ASTM Standard D-2487, "Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes."

(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-68. - Smart growth and redevelopment. 
    In order to protect people and property, it is required that new construction or substantially improved structures provide: 
(1)  Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the SFHA is prohibited unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  A fifty-foot setback from the floodway limits must remain in its undeveloped condition. An additional twenty-five (25) feet setback shall remain free of impermeable surfaces. 
(3)  All new and substantially improved residential structures and subdivision designs partially in the SFHA shall consist of one (1) structure on lots no smaller than one (1) acre. Increased density is an acceptable redevelopment practice with specific guidelines, but must be located outside of the SFHA. 
(4)  All new construction that requires a land disturbance permit from public works engineering shall include a hydrology study to determine the effects of such development. Those effects shall not exceed any of the provisions of this chapter. 
a.  Flood waters originating in these areas shall not be allowed to drain from the area described in higher quantities or flow rates than existed under pre-development conditions. This shall be accomplished by the proper design and construction of detention or drainage systems. 
(5)  Require critical structures to be located outside of the 500-year floodplain (shaded X or B zones). These structures include but are not limited to police and fire departments, EOCs, hospitals, schools, nursing homes, etc.

(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-71. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Hurst or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.

(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-74. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has, in the Flood Control and Insurance Act, V.T.C.A., Water Code, § 16.311 et seq., delegated the responsibility of local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses in their role of promoting the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of Hurst, Texas does ordain this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2058, § 1, 5-26-09) 
Sec. 9-75. - Penalties. 
    This article governs and relates to public health and sanitation. Any person violating the provisions of the article shall be guilty of an offense punishable by a fine not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and not to exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000.00).

Such notice and failure to comply with it is not an element of an offense defined in this article, but an element of a separate and distinct offense under this subsection. 
(b)  This notice shall be served either: 
(1)  Personally to the owner in writing; 
(2)  By a letter addressed to the owner at the owner's address as recorded in the appraisal district records of Tarrant County; or

(c)  In a notice provided under this section, the city may inform the owner by regular mail or a posting on the property that if the owner commits another violation of the same kind or nature that poses a danger to the public health and safety on or before the first anniversary of the date of the notice, the city without further notice may correct the violation at the owner's expense and assess the expense against the property. If a violation covered by a notice under this section occurs within the one-year period, and the city has not been informed in writing by the owner of an ownership change, then the city, without notice, may do the work or make the improvements required and pay for the work done or improvements made and charge the expenses and an administrative fee to the owner of the property. 
(d)  If the owner of any lot or premises, upon which a condition described in this article exists, fails to correct, remedy, or remove such nuisance within seven (7) days after notice to do so is given in accordance with this article, the city may do the work or make the improvements required, and pay for the work done or improvements made and charge the expenses incurred to the owner of the property. In addition to the expenses incurred by the city, an administrative fee will be added for the administrative expenses of the city. The amount of such fee will be approved from time to time by the city manager and the fee schedule will be on file in the city secretary's and the building official's office. 
(e)  The city's expenses for correcting or removing the nuisance may be assessed against the lot of real estate upon which the work was done or the improvements made. Whenever any work is done or improvements are made by the city under the provisions of this section, the mayor, municipal health authority, or municipal official designated by the mayor, on behalf of the city shall file a statement of the expenses with the county clerk.

Sec. 12-403. - Principal amount of security instrument. 
    The principal amount of any security instrument shall be fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for any single well. If, after completion of a well, the applicant/operator, who initially posted a fifty thousand-dollar bond, has complied with all of the provisions of this article and whose well is in the producing state and all drilling operations have ceased, may submit a request to the city to reduce the existing bond to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the remainder of the time the well produces without reworking. During reworking operations, the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be maintained at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
    An applicant/operator drilling or reworking between one (1) and five (5) wells at any given time, may elect to provide a blanket bond or letter of credit in the principal minimum amount of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00). If the applicant/operator drills or reworks more than five (5) wells at a time, the blanket bond or letter of credit shall be increased in increments of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) per each additional well. Once the wells are in the producing stage and all drilling operations have ceased, the applicant/operator may elect to provide a blanket bond or letter of credit for the remainder of the time the well produces, without reworking, as follows: 
Number of Producing Wells Blanket Bond/Letter of Credit Amount Required Up to 75 wells $100,000.00 75 to 150 wells  150,000.00 More than 150 wells  200,000.00  
    If at any time, after no less than a fifteen-day written notice to the operator and a public hearing, the city council shall deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, it may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) per well.

Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the city to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. After receipt of such notice, the operator shall, within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay over to the city one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the estimated cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than thirty (30) days, unless the failure presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this article.

(b)  This article addresses the design and location of driveways and other points of access to public streets under the jurisdiction of the City of Hurst. It is based upon the authority of the city and considers existing and projected traffic volumes, the functional classification of public streets, the thoroughfare plan, drainage requirements, the character of properties adjoining the street, the type and volume of traffic to use access, other operational aspects of the access, the availability of regional vehicular access from other local streets, and the public health, welfare and safety.

The issuance of such permit shall be governed by Article III of Chapter 20 of the Hurst Code. The city engineer's approval shall be required for all apartment, commercial and industrial property driveways. No work shall be undertaken on a driveway until the executed permit has been received by the applicant. 
(b)  Driveway permits shall be issued only in compliance with this article and may include terms and conditions authorized by this article as well as by Article III. In no event shall a driveway be allowed or permitted if it is deemed by the director of public works to be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare.

Any application for subdivision plat approval must provide that all lots and parcels created by the subdivision will have direct access to the city street system in conformance with the purpose and requirements of this article. 
(d)  Where in the course of public street reconstruction by the city or the State of Texas it becomes necessary to alter, relocate, or bring into conformance with this article an existing driveway, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the required changes.

(a)  When an application for building permit or certificate of occupancy creates changes in property use which result in changes in the type of driveway operation, and the driveway is not in conformance with this article, the reconstruction, relocation or conformance of the access to the article will be required as a condition of the building permit. One (1) of the following access change conditions must be met before driveway revisions may be required: 
(1)  The existing use of the driveway is projected to increase in actual or proposed daily vehicular volume by twenty (20) percent or more. 
(2)  The change in the use of the property or modifications to the property restricts the flow of vehicles entering the property in a manner which is anticipated to disrupt normal traffic flow in the public street, thereby creating a hazard. 
(b)  Change in property use may include but is not necessarily limited to change in type of business, expansion in an existing business, change in zoning, and subdivision which creates new parcels. It does not include modifications in advertising, landscaping, remodeling, general maintenance, or aesthetics that do not affect internal or external traffic flow or safety.

(b)  The city may install barriers across or remove any driveway providing direct access to a city street which is constructed without a driveway permit after the effective date of this article. The property owners shall be sent written notice of the city's action within ten (10) days. When practicable, the city will notify the property owners and/or illegal access user of pending action. Any person who drives a vehicle onto or from any city street except in a legal and property driveway or at permitted new access locations shall be guilty of an offense and punished in accordance with the penalty provisions hereof. 
(c)  When a permitted driveway is constructed or used in violation of this article, permit terms or conditions, the city may obtain a court order enjoining violation thereof. Such driveway permits may be revoked by the city if, at any time, the permitted driveway and its use fail to meet the requirements of the article of the terms and conditions of the permits.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 21-1. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "City of Hurst Subdivision Regulations." 
(Code 1965, § 21A-1) 
Sec. 21-2. - Definitions. 
    The words and phrases as used in this chapter shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in the definitions of the comprehensive zoning ordinance or, if such terms are not therein defined, in the building code of the city, the ordinance regulating standards for streets and storm sewers as currently adopted by the city, or the chapter of this Code regulating water and sanitary sewers. 
(Code 1965, § 21A-2) 
Cross reference- Building code, § 5-26 et seq.; streets, sidewalks and storm sewers, Ch. 20; utilities, Ch. 26; zoning, Ch. 27. 
Sec. 21-3. - General purpose of chapter. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city to cooperate with subdividers of property to promote sound planning in the subdivision of land in order to prevent errors in platting rather than have the city be required to make expensive future corrections. The rules and regulations, as set forth in this chapter, have been made after careful study by the planning and zoning commission and the city council of existing local conditions and the desirable future of modern subdivision planning principles as recommended by the city staff and consultants and as followed by other progressive cities in this state and this general locality. 
(b)  It is not the desire nor the intent of the city council or the planning commission to regiment the design of subdivisions of property in the city and its environs, but rather to recommend the utilization, to the fullest possible extent, of good sound modern subdivision planning principles. It is intended that as much freedom as possible be allowed the individual owners and subdividers in the design and ultimate development of new subdivisions so they will contribute to the community new residential neighborhoods with individuality and character and, at the same time, provide for sufficient and adequate major and secondary traffic thoroughfares, public utilities, parks, playgrounds and other public grounds that may be required. It is also intended by this chapter to preserve the integrity of the plans for the city which have been formulated and to meet the provisions of the zoning ordinance which is designed and intended to stabilize and protect the established pattern of the best land usage of all property within and to be ultimately added to the city. 
(c)  It is suggested that each owner or subdivider of land confer with the city staff before preparing the preliminary plat of his proposed subdivision and secure a copy of the rules and regulations governing subdivisions of land so that he may become thoroughly familiar with the city's subdivision requirements and policies and with the features, provisions and recommendations of the various plans for the city that may relate to and have effect upon the general area in which the proposed subdivision is situated. 
(Code 1965, § 21A-3) 
Sec. 21-4. - Platting-Required. 
    Whenever within the corporate limits of the city, or within five (5) miles of such limit and not within the boundaries of any other city, any tract of land is divided into two (2) or more parts and before any contract for sale of, or any offer to sell, any part of any land is made, and before any permit for the erection of a structure or any improvement shall be granted by the inspection office, the owner or owners of such land or their duly authorized agent shall obtain the approval of the city council in compliance with the regulations of this chapter. An owner may seek approval of a plat of a portion of his land, leaving the balance unplatted, but the city council may require platting of all or a portion of the balance as a condition of approval of any portion in order to insure proper planning and installation of essential services. 
(Code 1965, § 21A-4) 
Sec. 21-4.1. - Same-Application fees required. 
    Every application for preliminary plat, final plat, short form plat or replat shall be accompanied by a filing fee in an amount sufficient to defray the cost of reviewing the processing and posting the application. Such fees shall be based upon average current cost to the city and should be established and amended by the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 1184, § 1, 4-28-87) 
Sec. 21-5. - Preliminary plat. 
(a)  After consultation with members of the city staff, the person seeking approval, hereinafter called the subdivider, shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together with improvement plans and other materials required by this chapter. 
(b)  Eight (8) copies or prints of the preliminary plat of any proposed subdivision showing all unplatted property under the same ownership adjacent thereto shall be submitted to the city planning commission by filing the same in the office of the director of planning and development, at least twenty-eight (28) days prior to the regular meeting at which such preliminary plat is sought to be filed. Such preliminary plat shall carry the legend "Preliminary Plat-For Inspection Purposes Only." The preceding legend may be supplied by a stamp in the office of the secretary of the planning and zoning commission, but the same shall be signed by the individual filing the preliminary plat. Such preliminary plat shall be drawn to a scale of one (1) inch to one hundred (100) feet and shall show or be accompanied by the following information: 
(1)  Proposed subdivision name or identifying title, and the name of the city, county and state in which the subdivision is located. 
(2)  Name and address of record owners, subdivider, engineer, surveyor, land planner and any other person responsible for survey and design. 
(3)  Location of boundary or property lines; width and location of platted streets, alleys and easements within or adjacent to the property being subdivided; present physical features on the land including natural and artificial watercourses, ditches, ravines, culverts, bridges, present structures and any other feature directly pertinent to the land being subdivided; location of any existing utilities and pipelines showing pipe sizes and capacities of sewers and water mains and drainage facilities; outline of any existing wooded areas. A topographic map of the proposed area to be subdivided will accompany the preliminary plat. Contour intervals of the map shall not be greater than ten (10) feet with all grades shown thereon tied to city datum, or such datum of any public authority that may have established datum in the Hurst area. The description of the property shall include the approximate acreage. 
(4)  The street system design, location of the width of the proposed streets, easements and alleys; building lots and other features and their relationship to streets, alleys and easements in adjacent subdivision. If there are no adjacent subdivisions thereto, a vicinity or location map, drawn at a smaller scale, shall be submitted along with the preliminary plat, this map to show the boundaries and ownership of adjacent property, the location and distance to the nearest subdivision and the manner in which the streets, alleys, easements and highways of the proposed subdivision may eventually connect with those of the nearest existing subdivision. 
(5)  Classification and designation of the intended uses of land within the proposed subdivision setting out residential, retail business, industrial, off-street parking and all other parcels of land intended to be dedicated to public use, such as schools, parks, playgrounds and any other special uses or semipublic uses that may be required. 
(6)  Date, north point and scale of a drawing or subdivision layout. 
(7)  Preliminary plans of proposed water distribution system, sewage collection system, on-site and off-site drainage system, and street improvements. 
(8)  Where the preliminary plat submitted for approval covers only a part, a unit or increment of the owner's or subdivider's entire holding or ultimate subdivision, a sketch of the prospective future street system of the unsubmitted part shall be furnished and the street system portion submitted for approval will be considered in the light of adjustments and connections with the street system of the part not submitted. It is to be understood that the approval of the preliminary plat by the city planning and zoning commission does not constitute an official acceptance of the proposed subdivision by the city, but does constitute an authorization to begin and proceed with the preparation of the final subdivision plat. There shall be no work done in the field of the proposed subdivision until the final plat has been approved and accepted, except for clearing necessary for surveying purposes. Approval of the preliminary plat expires at the end of nine (9) months, unless the final plat has been submitted for approval. 
(9)  Following review of the preliminary plat and other materials submitted for conformity thereof to regulations of this chapter and other city codes and negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements to be made by him, the planning and zoning commission shall, within thirty (30) days, act thereon as submitted or as modified; and, if approved, the planning and zoning commission shall express its approval as conditional approval the conditions of such approval, one (1) of which shall be the filing of a final plat or, if disapproved, shall express its disapproval. 
(10)  After approval of disapproval of a preliminary plat, the same shall be forwarded to the city council for its inspection and comment, but such comment shall not be prerequisite to the filing of the final plat with the planning and zoning commission as provided hereinafter. 
(11)  All requests for city participation in over-sized facilities shall be made at the time of filing the preliminary plat. 
(Code 1965, § 21A-5; Ord. No. 1097, § 1, 10-8-85; Ord. No. 1133, § 1, 6-24-86; Ord. No. 1287, § 1, 6-26-90) 
Sec. 21-6. - Short-form platting. 
(a)  Property meeting the conditions of this section may be approved on final plat without the necessity of a preliminary plat. Such conditions are as follows: 
(1)  The subject property must be zoned appropriately for the intended uses. 
(2)  The lot or lots created by the proposed plat must be generally compatible with the adjacent lots or tracts. 
(3)  The lot dimension and sizes shall meet the requirements of the zoning ordinance and shall front on existing public streets. 
(4)  The plat must not propose any vacation of public rights-of-way or easements. 
(5)  The extension of public facilities, such as streets or utilities, must not be required for utilization of the property, except for minor extensions existing water or sewer lines, which shall be deemed to mean extensions of one hundred fifty (150) feet or less. 
(6)  The proposed development must not create nor contain any major drainage problems and, if contained within the 100-year floodplain, must conform to FIA floodplain management rules. No lot which encroaches into a floodway may be approved under this procedure. 
(7)  There must be no request for city participation. 
(b)  If minor water or sewer extensions (less than one hundred fifty (150) feet) are necessary for utilization of the lots created by the short-form plat, evidence shall accompany the final plat submittal that the commitment for the installation of these extensions has been made by the owner in accordance with current city policy. 
(c)  If in the opinion of the director of public works, the planning and zoning commission or the city council there is a necessity for preliminary plat submittal, the short-form platting procedure may not be utilized. 
(d)  If the city council or the planning and zoning commission deems it appropriate, either body may approve a short-form plat as a preliminary plat only, in which case a final plat shall be required before the property shall be deemed platted. 
(e)  If the short-term plat procedure is utilized, the applicant shall, at least twenty-eight (28) days prior to the date of the regular meeting of the planning commission, file two (2) Mylars and eight (8) prints or copies not larger than twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches with the director of planning and development for review and submission to the planning commission. The date of such planning commission meeting shall be deemed the date upon which the short-form plat is filed with the planning commission. 
(f)  No later than thirty (30) days after the filing of the short-form plat with the planning and zoning commission, such short-form plat shall be deemed submitted to the city council, which shall act thereon within thirty (30) days. 
(Ord. No. 1097, § 1, 10-8-85; Ord. No. 1133, § 2, 6-24-86) 
Sec. 21-7. - Final plat. 
(a)  The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved, incorporating all changes, directions and additions imposed by either the planning commission or city council. The final plat shall not be released for filing until detailed engineering plans have been approved by the city and addresses assigned to each lot or parcel of land. All plats, preliminary and final, shall be deemed disapproved until there has been full compliance with all requirements contained in this chapter and such additional requirements imposed by the city or its agents for which provision is herein made. 
(b)  Prior to submission of the final plat to the planning and zoning commission, the final plat and all required plans shall be submitted to the director of public works for checking compliance with city design standards and the preliminary plat. 
(c)  Five (5) sets of engineering plans showing details of streets, alleys, culverts, bridges, storm sewers, water mains, sanitary sewers and other engineering details of the proposed subdivision shall be submitted to the director of public works along with the final plat of the subdivision. Such plans shall be prepared in digital format, by a registered professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Texas and shall conform to the standard specifications established by the city. Upon plan approval by the city, the plat and all proposed improvements separated on different layers shall be submitted in a format specified by the public works department prior to placement of the final plat on the city council agenda. 
(d)  Following the completion of engineering plans, pro rata changes, impact fee credits shall be calculated as provided by article II of this chapter. The developer shall provide cost figures for all items for which a credit is requested, and such items shall be subject to verification. 
(e)  Two (2) mylar and eight (8) prints or copies of this final plat, not larger than twenty-two (22) inches by thirty-four (34) inches, shall be submitted to the planning commission by filing the same in the office of the director of planning and development at least twenty-eight (28) days prior to the date of the regular meeting of that body at which consideration is requested and on which date such plat shall be deemed filed. This plat shall carry the legend Final Plat and shall be drawn to scale of one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet. All figures and letters shown thereon shall be plain, distinct and large enough to be easily read. Should more than one (1) sheet be required for the layout, there shall be included with the several large-scale drawings a key map showing the entire subdivision, drawn at a smaller scale, with block numbers and street names; this key map is to be included upon the first sheet or separately upon a cover sheet of the same size as the large-scale sheets. The final plat shall show or be accompanied by the following information: 
(1)  The subdivision name or identifying title and the name of the city, county and state in which the subdivision is located as well as the name and address of the record owner or subdivider. 
(2)  The name or names of adjacent subdivisions, names of streets and numbers of lots and blocks. Names of new streets should, whenever possible, follow or be extensions of existing street names. 
(3)  An accurate boundary survey of the property which is being subdivided, noting the bearings and distances of the sides, the same being referenced to original survey lines, or established subdivisions showing the lines of all adjacent lands and property, lines of adjacent streets, alleys and easements, noting width and names of each. Streets, alleys and easements of adjacent subdivisions shall be shown in a different manner than those of the proposed subdivision, possibly dotted or dashed. 
(4)  The location of all the lots, streets, highways, alleys, easements, parks, playgrounds and other features with accurate dimensions given in feet and decimals of a foot, showing the length of radii, deflection angle and arcs of all curves; tangent distances and tangent bearings shall be given for each street, all such data being complete and sufficiently precise to permit accurate location upon the ground.

Any private restrictions or any trusteeships intended shall be filed with the plat if the same are too lengthy to permit lettering upon the plat. 
(8)  A receipt indicating that all taxes have been paid. 
(9)  Proper certification shall be made upon the plat by a reputable registered civil engineer or land surveyor, licensed in the state, ascertaining that the plan represents a survey made by him and that all necessary monuments are accurately and correctly shown upon the plat. The engineers shall place such monuments as required by the city, and they shall be set at all corners in angle points of the boundaries of the original tract to be subdivided and at all street intersections, angle points, street lines and points of curve and at such intermediate points as shall be required by the city. All lot corners shall also be marked with pipe markers driven firmly into solid earth. Such monuments shall be of pipe not less than three-fourths (3/4) of an inch in diameter and two (2) feet in length driven securely into solid earth with the grades of the same being at the grade with the established sidewalk or, if a walk is not established, flush with natural grade of the earth's surface. 
(10)  Proper blanks for certification of approval to be filled out by the planning and zoning commission and city council and blanks for cabinets, slide and date to be filled out by the county.

(Code 1965, § 21A-6; Ord. No. 1097, § 3, 10-8-85; Ord. No. 1133, § 3, 6-24-87; Ord. No. 1287, § 2, 6-26-90; Ord. No. 1597, § 1, 1-13-98; Ord. No. 1773, § 1, 5-8-01; Ord. No. 1782, § 1, 5-8-01) 
Sec. 21-8. - General platting requirements. 
    The owner or subdivider of property shall observe the following general requirements and principles of land subdivision: 
(1)  In general, the proposed subdivision plats shall conform to the general projected future land use pattern as outlined by the several plans for expansion of streets, utilities and land use. 
(2)  The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the continuation and extension of major and secondary thoroughfares and collectors as are shown on the thoroughfare plan adopted by the city council. Minor residential streets in the subdivision shall provide convenient circulation of local traffic within the subdivision and adequate access to all building lots within the subdivision. Lots shall be so arranged that there will be no direct access from residential lots to collectors and thoroughfares. Lots with frontage on collectors shall be restricted to rear-entry garages. Off-center street intersections will not be approved except in unusual cases. Parkways and boulevards shall be of such width as may be designated by the city council. Street right-of-way shall not be less than as required by the current street standards ordinance of the city. 
(3)  In order that the proper relationship of new subdivision streets may be maintained with adjoining streets and land, the system of streets in a new subdivision, except in unusual cases, must connect with streets already dedicated in adjacent subdivisions that have been platted. There must, in general, be a reasonable projection of the streets in the nearest subdivided tracts, and the same must be continued to the boundaries of the tract subdivided, so that other subdivisions may be connected therewith. 
(4)  All lots shall be adjacent to a dedicated street to which access is allowed. Where a tract of land is subdivided into parcels that are larger than normal building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to permit the opening of future streets and a logical ultimate resubdivision. 
(5)  Streets designated to be dead-ended permanently shall be platted and constructed with a paved cul-de-sac. Any dead-end street of a permanent or temporary nature, if longer than two hundred (200) feet, shall have a surfaced turning area eighty (80) feet in diameter for a cul-de-sac. Temporary dead-end streets shall have provisions for future extension of the street and utilities and, if the temporary cul-de-sac is required on site, a reversionary right to the land abutting the turnaround for excess right-of-way shall be provided. An offsite turnaround will be permitted provided a temporary easement that terminates when the street is extended is obtained from the adjacent property owner. 
    A street ending permanently in a cul-de-sac shall not be longer than six hundred (600) feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter for at least eighty (80) feet and a street property line diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet. Cul-de-sacs may be provided where the shape of a portion of the proposed subdivision or the terrain of the land would make it difficult, uneconomical or unreasonable to plat with connecting streets. 
    In general, no reserve strips controlling access to land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use shall be permitted. The design of untraveled center sections in the turnaround and the central strip of boulevards, as well as other nonroadway portions of streets, shall be subject to city council approval. 
(6)  Block length generally should not exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet in length and shall not be less than two hundred ninety (290) feet in length as measured from centerlines of streets. 
(7)  Alleys or loading courts of a minimum width of twenty (20) feet of paved surface or, in lieu thereof, adequate off-street loading space, shall be provided in business blocks. Alleys are not required in residential districts, except they shall be provided where alleys of adjacent subdivisions already platted would be closed or dead-ended by failure to provide alleys in the new subdivision. 
(8)  If alleys are not provided, easements of not less than five (5) feet for public utilities shall be provided on each side of rear lot lines. If necessary for the extension of water or sewer mains, storm drainage or other utilities, easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots. In all cases, easements shall connect with already established easements in adjoining property. 
(9)  Curb radii at street intersections shall be not less than twenty (20) feet and property lines shall be adjusted accordingly. 
(10)  Maximum degree of curvature of streets shall be fourteen and five-tenths (14.5) degrees for residential streets, twelve (12) degrees for collectors and nine (9) degrees for arterials and thoroughfares. The maximum grade of all streets shall not exceed eight (8) percent, nor shall the minimum be less than five-tenths percent except upon recommendation of the city engineering staff. 
(11)  The minimum dimensions for lots shall be as prescribed by the comprehensive zoning ordinance, which sets forth different standards for different districts. Minimum size for such lots shall also be as provided by the comprehensive zoning ordinance. Double frontage lots are undesirable and should not be allowed if at all possible. 
(12)  Side lot lines, insofar as practicable, shall be at right angles or radial to street lines. 
(13)  Building lines shall be shown on all lots. Such lines shall be no less than that required by yard requirements of the zoning ordinance and shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet behind the property line for all lots with access onto collector streets and thirty-five (35) feet for arterials and thoroughfares. If lots are being platted in an area where other buildings are built closer than these requirements, the city council may waive this requirement. 
(14)  The city council may refuse to approve a plat when there is evidence that the same cannot be served with adequate water and sewer or street facilities within a period of two (2) years. It is anticipated that the subdivider will have the burden of showing how he proposes to furnish water, sewer and street services within such time if such are not immediately adjacent to such proposed subdivision. 
(15)  All proposed subdivisions shall be reviewed to assure that: 
a.  All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
b.  All public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and 
c.  Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazard. 
(Code 1965, § 21A-7; Ord. No. 12-79, § 1, 4-10-90) 
Sec. 21-9. - Required subdivision improvements. 
(a)  Waterlines; sewer lines. The subdivider or developer, in the case of any subdivision of land, will be required to install at his own expense all waterlines and sewer lines in accordance with city standards and specifications covering the same, including all engineering costs covering design layout and construction supervision. This shall apply to both the facilities within the subdivision and those required to connect such subdivision with service presently in place and designed to serve such area. Preliminary plans and layouts for all such utility lines shall be submitted by the subdivider or developer to the planning and zoning commission for study by the city staff along with the submission of the preliminary plat of the subdivision. Final construction plans will be submitted by the subdivider at the time of filing his final plat with the city's planning and zoning commission in the same number of copies as required of the subdivision plan, and failure to so file will be grounds for denial of the plat. There will be no participation by the city in the cost of any underground utility lines except for credits which may be allowed against impact fees otherwise due as a condition of development for items appearing on the impact fee capital improvement plan. 
(b)  Street improvements; curb and gutter; sidewalks; storm sewer and pavement. The subdivider of each tract of land will be required to construct at his own expense those improvements required to serve the land platted. Such improvements shall include streets, sidewalks, pavement, curbs and gutters, storm sewers and any other improvements, all as required by chapter 20 of this Code and the street and storm sewer ordinance of the city. The subdivider shall install, construct or reconstruct the same, all according to current city standards and specifications as provided in such ordinances, and shall pay all costs, including engineering costs covering design, layout and construction supervision by the city as well as inspection fees. If the subdivision is adjacent to a street, a sidewalk or storm drainage facility not meeting current city standards and specifications, such shall be reconstructed to current standards unless the developer secures a waiver in writing from the city council. As a condition to such waiver, the city council may require deposit of an escrow amount sufficient to pay for an improvement of one-half (1/2) of the street and all adjacent improvements subject to such participation as the city may agree to under this section. Such escrow without interest shall be applied against any assessment for improvements levied on such property but shall not be deemed to relieve such property from liability for any costs assessed which exceed the escrow. Preliminary plans for improvements shall be submitted to the city planning and zoning commission for a study and approval by the city staff if acceptable. Detailed construction plans, including plan and profile for each street, shall be filed with the submission of the final plat in the same number of copies as required of the final subdivision plat, and failure to supply the same shall be grounds for denial of the final plat. Streets shall be built to the standards required for the classification such streets carry on the city's thoroughfare plan, and the costs shall be borne by the developer. If participation in the construction of oversize streets by the city is desired, the subdivider may request the same, and the city council will consider each such request upon its individual merits prior to construction. Participation by the city will not exceed more than ten (10) percent of paving costs on streets wider than thirty-one (31) feet from back of curb and not exceeding twenty-five (25) percent of the paving costs for streets wider than thirty-seven (37) feet from back of curb to back of curb. The city will not consider any participation in projects for which a final plat has been approved and will not be bound unless and until it enters into a written contract setting forth in detail the amount and extent of the city's participation. Participation on oversize shall not include engineering, design, survey or inspection fees. A written contract for city participation by the time of final plat approval will be a condition precedent to any payment of city funds. The city shall not pay more than the cost of construction for extra traffic lanes required by the city for turning movements onto public streets. The city may require but shall not pay for medians or extra lanes required to provide safe ingress or egress for the subdivider's property. Any existing street, curb and gutter, sidewalk or storm sewer damaged during the construction of a subdivision shall be repaired or replaced by the developer at the discretion of the city manager or his designee. 
(c)  Street signs, streetlights, underground utilities. The developer shall furnish and install all street signs and street lighting to city standards as follows: 
(1)  Street lights shall be installed at the time of electric utility facilities.

(2)  The city agrees in writing to permit the owner of the property to construct or finance the required capital improvement or facility expansion and agrees that the costs incurred or funds advanced will either: 
a.  Be credited against the impact fees otherwise due from the new development; 
b.  Reimburse the owner for such costs from impact fees paid from other new developments that will use such capital improvements or facility expansions in which case fees shall be reimbursed to the owner at the time collected as other new development plats are recorded; or 
c.  The owner voluntarily requests that the city reserve capacity to serve future development and the city, and the owner enter into a valid written agreement.

Pro rata charges paid shall be credited against impact fees in the same manner as expenditures for facilities constructed as set forth in subsection (b) hereinabove above. 
(d)  An owner shall be entitled to a credit against any category of impact fee as provided in any written agreement between the city and the owner.

To compensate the city for the use of the rights-of-way, provider whose telecommunications network is used to serve persons in the city shall pay the city a monthly fee to be calculated as provided below for each access line owned or used by the provider, as calculated as of month-end, that is activated for use by an end user customer of the provider or of another person as a certificated telecommunications utility, by lease or otherwise, subject to subsection (f) below or of any other person; 
(1)  Access line fee calculation amount. 
a.  Following the effective date of the municipal consent, a provider shall submit to the city manager on a quarterly basis, a certified statement together with the access line fee payment under section 23.5-42, indicating the number of access lines used to provide telecommunications service at month end, for each month of the quarter and for each customer class identified herein. The statement shall be provided on a form prescribed by the city manager. 
b.  For each month of the quarter following the effective date of the municipal consent, a provider shall pay an access line fee which is based upon its number of access lines calculated as follows: 
Access Line Fee 
Calculation Amount Monthly Amount Per 
Access Line From 
Effective Date TYPE (1) or (2): Residential $1.09 per month Non-Residential $3.34 per month TYPE (3): Private Line Termination Point(s) $3.34 per month  
The city reserves the right to make reasonable adjustments to the access line fee, with one hundred eighty (180) days notice, but not to exceed ten (10) percent in any one (1) year. 
Amounts appearing above are used to calculate the total compensation due the city and are not to be construed as the setting of a charge for end-users. 
(To the extent allowed by law, and not at the direction or request of the city, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Utilities Code § 54.206, a provider has the discretion to collect the access line fee imposed by the city pursuant to this article through a pro rata charge to the customers in the boundaries of the city, including from any other persons who are leasing, reselling, rebundling or otherwise using the provider's access lines to provide telecommunications service.) 
(For purposes of this section only, lines terminating at customers with "Lifeline," "Tel-Assistance," or other service that is required to be similarly discounted pursuant to state or federal law or regulation for the purpose of advancing universal service to the economically disadvantaged shall not be included in the lines upon which the fee is calculated, but provider shall provide information on the number of such lines upon request by the city.) 
(2)  Number of access lines. Subject to city's agreement not to disclose this information unless required by law, provider agrees to provide annually or as requested by the city, within a reasonable time after receipt of the city's written request, a report showing the number of access lines being maintained or operated by provider that are serving premises within the city. The city agrees that the report shall be used solely for the purposes of verifying the number of provider's access lines serving premises within the city. Upon written request, provider shall verify the information in the report and, upon reasonable advance notice, all non-customer specific records and other documents required for such verification shall be subject to inspection by the city expressly excluding any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. 
(b)  Minimum annual fee. Notwithstanding any other provision in this article, for all new installations of facilities placed in, on or under the public rights-of-way from the effective date of the municipal consent, and for each calendar year period thereafter, the provider shall pay the city a minimum annual fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) ("minimum fee"), in the event the annual access line fee does not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), with a credit against the minimum fee from any access line fee paid to the city during the previous twelve months. 
Each municipal consent shall provide that the minimum fee of subsection (b) above may be adjusted once every three (3) years by the city, but such adjustment shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) in any one (1) three-year period. 
(c)  Confidential records. If the provider notifies the city by a conspicuous written notation of the confidential nature of any information (including, but not limited to the information in paragraph (b) of this section), reports, documents, or writings, the city agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the information, reports, documents, and writings to the extent permitted by law. Upon receipt by the city of requests for the provider's confidential information, reports, documents, or writings, the city shall notify the provider of the request in writing by facsimile transmission. The city shall furnish the provider with copies of all requests for attorney general opinions pertaining to the provider's confidential information, reports, documents or writings. The city shall request an attorney general's opinion before disclosing any confidential information, reports, documents or writings, and shall furnish the provider with copies of attorney general opinion requests as soon as practicable that it may pertain to the provider's confidential information, reports, documents or writings. 
(d)  No other fees. The payments due hereunder shall be in lieu of any construction, building or other permit, approval, inspection, or other similar fees or charges, including, but not limited to, all general business permit fees customarily assessed by the city for the use of the public rights-of-way against persons operating businesses similar to that of a provider. Further, such access line fee shall constitute full compensation to the city for all provider's facilities located within the public rights-of-way, including interoffice-transport and other transmission media that do not terminate at an end-user customer's network interface device, even though those types of lines are not used in the calculation of the public rights-of-way fee. The compensation paid herein is not in lieu of any generally applicable ad valorem taxes, sales taxes or other generally applicable taxes, fees, development impact fees or charges, or other statutory charges or expenses recoverable under the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, or successor statutes. 
(e)  Uncollectibles. Any other provision of this agreement notwithstanding, provider shall not be obligated to pay the city for any access lines or private line termination points the revenues for which remain uncollectible. 
(f)  Payments by or use of the network by other telecommunications carriers and providers. 
(1)  Direct payment-Facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers. To the extent allowed by applicable state and federal law, any telecommunications service providers who purchase unbundled network elements or other facilities or services for the purpose of rebundling those facilities and/or services to create telecommunications service for sale to persons within the city ("rebundler"), must pay to the city the access line fee that is calculated as of month-end by applying the appropriate access line fee, as specified in section 23.5-41 above, to each access line created by rebundling telecommunications service or facilities. Direct payment further ensures that the access line fee imposed herein can be applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all telecommunications service providers that sell telecommunications service within the city. Other provisions of this article notwithstanding, the provider shall not include in its monthly count of access lines any facilities or services provided to other telecommunications service providers for rebundling into telecommunications service, if the telecommunications service provider who is rebundling those facilities for resale has provided a signed statement to the provider that the telecommunications service provider is paying the access line fees applicable to those rebundled services directly to the city. If provider provides a copy of the signed statement to the city from the rebundler which is acceptable to the city, then provider is absolved of all responsibility for the access line fees payable on the services, unbundled network facilities, and other facilities rebundled for the creation of telecommunications service for sale within the city by each such rebundler. 
(2)  Indirect payments-Public rights-of-way fee application to use of network by others. With respect to any person leasing, reselling, or otherwise using a provider's access lines, if a provider believes it does not have sufficient information to determine the appropriate rate to apply, then the higher access line fee may be applied until such time as the person using the access lines provides to the provider sufficient written information to determine the correct access line fee. If a person provides sufficient written information for the application of the access line fee, provider may, at its discretion and not at the city's request, bill the person on the basis of the information provided. Provider shall provide to the city any information regarding the locations to which it is providing service or facilities for use by another person for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers, so long as city first obtains written permission of such other person for provider to provide the information to the city. Any other provision of this article notwithstanding, however, a provider shall not be liable for underpayment of access line fees resulting from the provider's reliance upon the written information provided by any person who uses provider's services or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers.

(b)  A provider shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts and records of business and operations that cumulatively reflect the monthly count of all access lines for a period of seven (7) years. The city manager may require the keeping of additional records or accounts that are reasonably necessary for purposes of identifying, accounting for, and reporting the number of access lines used to deliver telecommunication services or for calculation of the payments due hereunder. The city may examine the provider's books and records referred to above, expressly excluding any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq, to the extent such records reasonably relate to providing information to verify compliance with this article and the municipal consent. 
(c)  A provider shall make available to the city or the city's designated agent (hereinafter "agent"), for the city or its agent to examine, audit, review and copy, in the city, on the city manager's written request, its books and records referred to above, including papers, books, accounts, documents, maps, plans and other provider records that pertain to municipal consent conditions and requirements obtained under this article. A provider shall fully cooperate in making records available and otherwise assist the city examiner. The city examiner shall not inspect or copy or otherwise demand production of customer specific information or any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. 
(d)  The city manager may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to providers' performance of the terms and conditions of a municipal consent conveyed under this article. Providers shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. 
(e)  Upon written request by the city manager, to the extent the documents are reasonably identified, providers shall furnish to the city within thirty (30) business days from the date of the written request copies of all public petitions, applications, written communications and reports submitted by providers, to the FCC and/or to the PUC or their successor agencies, relating to any matters affecting the physical use of city public rights-of-way. 
(f)  The provisions of this section shall be continuing and shall survive the termination of a municipal consent granted under this article and shall extend beyond the term of the municipal consent granted to the provider and the city shall have all the rights described in this section for so long as provider is providing any telecommunications service within the city. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 1, 2-23-99) 
Sec. 23.5-44. - Transfer. 
(a)  No municipal consent nor any rights or privileges that a provider has under a municipal consent, or the facilities held by a provider for use under such municipal consent which are in the public rights-of-way, shall be sold, resold, assigned, transferred or conveyed by the provider, either separately or collectively, to any other person, without the prior written approval of the city by ordinance or resolution. The city's approval shall be based upon the transferee providing adequate information to the city that it has the ability to perform and comply with the obligations and requirements of the municipal consent. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Should a provider sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests under its municipal consent, including such provider's telecommunications network, or attempt to do so, without the city's prior consent, the city may revoke the provider's municipal consent for default, in which event all rights and interest of the provider under the municipal consent shall cease. 
(b)  Any transfer in violation of this section shall be null and void and unenforceable. Any change of control of a provider shall constitute a transfer under this section. However, such a change in control shall not void the municipal consent as to the transferee, unless and until the city has given notice that such a change in control necessitates compliance with section 23.5-44. If the provider does not initiate compliance with section 23.5-44 by a request for municipal consent within thirty (30) days after the above notice has been given by the city, the municipal consent shall be null and unenforceable as to the transferee. 
(c)  There shall be a rebuttable presumption of a change of control of a provider upon a change of fifteen (15) percent or greater in the ownership of such provider. Such a change in control shall be deemed a transfer which requires consent of the city. 
(d)  A mortgage or other pledge of assets to a bank or lending institution in a bona fide lending transaction shall not be considered an assignment or transfer. 
(e)  Every municipal consent granted under this section 23.5-44 shall specify that any transfer or other disposition of rights which has the effect of circumventing payment of required access line fees or minimum fees and/or evasion of payment of such fees by failure to accurately count or report the number of access lines by a provider is prohibited. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything else in this section 23.5-44, if the city has not approved or denied a request to transfer under this section within one hundred twenty (120) days of written notice of such request from the provider to the city, it shall be deemed approved. Such time frame may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section 23.5-44, a provider may transfer, without city approval, the facilities in the public rights-of-way under a municipal consent to another provider who has a municipal consent under this article. The provider transferring the facilities remains subject to all applicable obligations and provisions of the municipal consent unless the provider to which the facilities are transferred is also subject to the same, as applicable, obligations and provisions. The provider transferring the facilities must give written notice of the transfer to the city manager.

(Ord. No. 1657, § 1, 2-23-99) 
Sec. 23.5-46. - Circumvention of fee prohibited. 
    A person may not circumvent payment of access line fees or evade payment of such fees by bartering, transfer of rights, or by any other means that result in undercounting a provider's number of lines. Capacity or services may be bartered if the imputed lines are reported in accordance with section 23.5-41. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 1, 2-23-99) 
Sec. 23.5-47. - Construction obligations. 
(a)  A provider is subject to the reasonable regulation of the city to manage its public rights-of-way pursuant to the city's rights as a custodian of public property under state and federal laws. A provider is subject to city ordinances and requirements and federal and state laws and regulations in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  At the city's request, a provider shall furnish the city accurate and complete information relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance, operation and repair of facilities performed by the provider in the public rights-of-way. 
(c)  The construction, expansion, reconstruction, excavation, use, maintenance and operation of a provider's facilities within the public rights-of-way are subject to applicable city requirements. 
(1)  A provider may be required to place certain facilities within the public rights-of-way underground according to applicable city requirements absent a compelling demonstration by the provider that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable or feasible nor is it equally applicable to other similar users of the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A provider shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations on other similar users of the public rights-of-way. The city shall waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the provider. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. A provider shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(3)  A provider must obtain a permit, as reasonably required by applicable city codes, prior to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation or maintenance of the provider's facilities. Once a permit is issued, provider shall give to the city a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of the above listed activities on its network in, on or under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the provider to request and obtain a permit from the city prior to performing any of the above listed activities in, on or over any public right-of-way, except in an emergency as provided for in subsection (10) below, will subject the provider to a stop-work order from the city and enforcement action pursuant to the city's Code of Ordinances. If the provider fails to act upon any permit within ninety (90) calendar days of issuance, the permit shall become invalid, and the provider will be required to obtain another permit. 
(4)  When a provider completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation or other work, the provider shall promptly restore the rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. A provider shall replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base, irrigation system and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance, or repair of the provider's facilities within thirty (30) calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the time of the work. 
(5)  Upon failure of a provider to perform any such repair or replacement work, and five (5) days after written notice has been given by the city to the provider, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been disturbed by the provider, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the provider will reimburse the city for the costs so incurred within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(6)  Should the city reasonably determine, within two (2) years from the date of the completion of the repair work, that the surface, base, irrigation system or landscape treatment requires additional restoration work to meet existing standards of the city, a provider shall perform such additional restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies as provided herein. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the city determines that the failure of a provider to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts. A provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(8)  A provider shall furnish the city with construction plans and maps showing the location and proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction at least fifteen (15) days (subject to subsection (d)), before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way. A provider may not begin construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing. 
(9)  If the city manager declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, a provider shall remove or abate the provider's facilities by the deadline provided in the city manager's request. The provider and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of service. If the provider, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the provider, without paying compensation to the provider and without the city incurring liability for damages.

The city reserves the right to lay sewer, gas, water, and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, and to do underground and overhead work, and attachments, restructuring or changes in aerial facilities in, across, along, over or under a public street, alley or public rights-of-way occupied by a provider, and to change the curb, sidewalks or the grade of streets. 
(b)  The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among competing users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each user type, and to the extent there is limited space available for additional users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law. 
(c)  If, during the term of a municipal consent, the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley, or public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the provider. If the city closes or abandons a public right-of-way that contains a portion of a provider's facilities, the city shall close or abandon such public right-of-way subject to the rights conveyed in the municipal consent. 
(d)  If the city gives written notice, a provider shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of provider's facilities that are in the public rights-of-way within one hundred twenty (120) days, except in circumstances that require additional time as reasonably determined by the city based upon information provided by the provider. For projects expected to take longer than one hundred twenty (120) days to remove, change or relocate, the city will confer with provider before determining the alterations to be required and the timing thereof. The city shall give notice whenever the city has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation of a city or other governmental public improvement in the public rights-of-way.

    If the provider fails to relocate facilities in the time allowed by the city in this section, the provider may be subject to liability to the city for such delay and as set forth in the city Code of Ordinances, now or hereafter enacted. 
    Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (d), the city manager and a provider may agree in writing to different time frames than those provided above if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change. 
(e)  During the term of its municipal consent, a provider may trim trees in or over the rights-of-way for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its network. All tree trimming shall be performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the city. Should the provider, its contractor or agent, fail to remove such trimmings within twenty-four (24) hours, the city may remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of a bill from the city, the provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred within thirty (30) working days. 
(f)  Providers shall temporarily remove, raise or lower its aerial facilities to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures, if the city gives written notice of no less than forty-eight (48) hours. The expense of these temporary re- 
arrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting and benefitting from the temporary rearrangements. Provider may require prepayment or prior posting of a bond from the party requesting temporary move.

(d)  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the bond are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this article, or authorized by law; and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such bond shall affect any other rights the city may have. 
(e)  The city manager or his designee may waive or reduce the above required bonding requirements, taking into consideration both that the provider has furnished the city with reasonable documentation to evidence adequate financial resources substantially greater than the bonding requirements, and has demonstrated in prior right-of-way construction activity, prompt resolution of any claims and substantial compliance with all required applicable building codes and ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 1, 2-23-99) 
Sec. 23.5-50. - Insurance requirements.

The city reserves the right to review the insurance requirements during the effective period of a municipal consent, and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the city manager determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims history of the industry or the provider require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the State of Texas or letters written by the provider in those instances where the state does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required herein. However, for the city to accept such letters the provider must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the city, based on financial information requested by and furnished to the city. 
(b)  Provider shall furnish, at no cost to the city, copies of certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required by this section to the city. The city may request the deletion, revision or modification of particular policy terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions, unless the policy provisions are established by a law or regulation binding the city, the provider, or the underwriter. If the city requests a deletion, revision or modification, a provider shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to accomplish the change. 
(c)  An insurance certificate shall contain the following required provisions: 
(1)  Name the city of and its officers, employees, board members and elected representatives as additional insurers for all applicable coverage;

(d)  Provider shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the city manager during the term of a municipal consent or an extension or renewal. An insurance certificate obtained in compliance with this section is subject to city approval. The city may require the certificate to be changed to reflect changing liability limits.

(f)  The policy clause "other insurance" shall not apply to the city if the city is an insured under the policy. 
(g)  The provider shall pay premiums and assessments. A company which issues an insurance policy has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a provider must provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the city in connection with damage covered by the policy. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 1, 2-23-99) 
Sec. 23.5-51. - Indemnity.

(b)  No municipal consent indemnity provision shall apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the city, its officers, employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors. 
(c)  The provisions of the required indemnity provision set forth in an individual municipal consent shall provide that:

Sec. 23.5-54. - Severability. 
    The provisions of this article are severable. However, in the event this article or any tariff that authorizes the provider to recover the fee(s) provided for this article or any procedure provided in this article or any compensation due the city under this article becomes unlawful, or is declared or determined by a judicial, administrative or legislative authority exercising its jurisdiction to be excessive, unrecoverable, unenforceable, void, illegal or otherwise inapplicable, in whole or in part, or is exchanged for another means of compensation under higher authority, the provider and city shall meet and negotiate a new agreement that is in compliance with the authority's decision or enactment. Unless explicitly prohibited, the new agreement shall provide the city with a level of compensation comparable to that set forth in this article as long as the agreed-to compensation is recoverable by the provider in a manner permitted by law for the unexpired portion of the term of this article.

(b)  Material breaches of a municipal consent specifically include, but are not limited to, continuing violations of sections 23.5-41 (Compensation to city), 23.5-47 (Construction obligations) and/or 23.5-48 (Conditions of public rights-of-way occupancy), and the furnishing of service of any kind that requires municipal authorization but that is not authorized by subsection 23.5-33(a).

(a)  The city council finds and determines that a vehicle approaching an intersection that fails to stop at a designated point, as required by Section 544.007 of the Texas Transportation Code, when the traffic control signal for that vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal damages the public by endangering motor vehicle operators and pedestrians alike by decreasing the efficiency of traffic control and traffic flow efforts, and by increasing the number of serious accidents to which public safety agencies must respond at the expense of the taxpayers. 
(b)  The owner of a motor vehicle is liable for a civil penalty of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) if the motor vehicle fails to stop at a designated point, as required by Section 544.007 of the Texas Transportation Code, when the traffic control signal for that motor vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal.

(c)  A notice of violation issued under this article shall contain the following:

Sec. 24-203. - Administrative adjudication hearing. 
(a)  A person who receives a notice of violation may contest the imposition of the civil penalty by request in writing an administrative adjudication of the civil penalty within the 30th day after the date the notice of violation was mailed. Upon receipt of a timely request, the department shall notify the person of the date and time of the hearing on the administrative adjudication. 
(b)  The administrative adjudication hearing shall be held before a hearing officer appointed by the city manager, whom shall have the authority to administer oaths and issue orders compelling the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents. 
(c)  Failure to pay a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability in the full amount of the civil penalty assessed in the notice of violation, and is a waiver of the right to appeal under section 24-203(j). 
(d)  The civil penalty shall not be assessed if after a hearing the hearing officer enters a finding of no liability. 
(e)  In an administrative adjudication hearing, the issues must be proved at the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence. The reliability of the photographic traffic signal enforcement system used to produce the recorded image of the violation may be attested to in an administrative adjudication hearing by affidavit of an officer or employee of the city or the entity with which the city contracts to install or operate the system and who is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system. An affidavit of an officer or employee of the city that alleges a violation based on an inspection of the pertinent recorded image is admissible in a proceeding under this article and is evidence of the facts contained in the affidavit. 
(f)  A person who is found liable for a civil penalty after an administrative adjudication hearing shall pay the civil penalty and costs within thirty-one (31) days of the hearing. 
(g)  It shall be an affirmative defense to the imposition of civil liability under this article, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, that: 
(1)  The traffic-control signal was not in proper position and sufficiently legible to an ordinarily observant person; 
(2)  The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of a police officer; 
(3)  The operator of the motor vehicle violated the instructions of the traffic-control signal so as to yield the right-of-way to an immediately approaching authorized emergency vehicle; 
(4)  The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle under Chapter 546 of the Texas Transportation Code, and that the operator was acting in compliance with that chapter; 
(5)  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle and being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner; 
(6)  The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was a stolen plate and being displayed on a motor vehicle other than the motor vehicle for which the plate had been issued; 
(7)  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually hazardous road conditions existed that would make compliance with this article more dangerous under the circumstances than noncompliance; 
(8)  The person who received the notice of violation was not the owner of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. 
(h)  To demonstrate that at the time of the violation the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate, the owner must submit proof acceptable to the hearing officer that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency. 
(i)  Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, a person who fails to pay the amount of a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing on the violation if: 
(1)  The person files an affidavit with the hearing officer stating the date on which the person received the notice of violation that was mailed to the person; and 
(2)  Within the same period required by section 24-202(c)(8)(B), for a hearing to be timely requested but measured from the date the mailed notice was received as stated in the affidavit filed under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the person requests an administrative adjudication hearing. 
(j)  A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing may appeal that finding of civil liability to the municipal court by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the municipal court. The notice of appeal must be filed not later than the thirty-first day after the date on which the administrative adjudication hearing officer entered the finding of civil liability. Unless the person, on or before the filing of the notice of appeal, posts a bond in the amount of the civil penalty and any late fees, an appeal does not stay the enforcement of the civil penalty, and must be accompanied by payment of the costs for the court as required by law. An appeal shall be determined by the municipal court by trial de novo. The affidavits submitted under subsection 24-203(e), shall be admitted by the municipal judge in the trial de novo, and the issues must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. A person found liable by the municipal court shall pay an appellate filing fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) in addition to the civil penalty and any other fees due the city.

(b)  The orders issued under subsection (a) may be filed with the office of the hearing examiner. The hearing examiner shall keep the orders in a separate index and file. The orders may be recorded using microfilm, microfiche, or data processing techniques. 
(Ord. No. 2028, § 1, 2-28-07) 
Sec. 24-205. - Effect of liability; exclusion of civil remedy. 
(a)  The imposition of a civil penalty under this article is not a criminal conviction for any purpose. 
(b)  A civil penalty may not be imposed under this article on the owner of a motor vehicle if the operator of the vehicle was arrested or was issued a citation and notice to appear by a peace officer for the same violation of Section 544.007(d) of the Texas Transportation Code recorded by the photographic traffic signal enforcement system. 
(c)  An owner who fails to pay the civil penalty or to timely contest liability for the penalty is considered to admit liability for the full amount of the civil penalty stated in the notice of violation mailed to the person. 
(d)  The city attorney is authorized to file suit to enforce collection of a civil penalty imposed under this article. 
(Ord. No. 2028, § 1, 2-28-07)

    The penalties and fees collected from the imposition of civil liability under this article shall be deposited in the traffic safety fund account established by the city council. Funds from the traffic safety fund may be expended only for the costs of automated signal enforcement under this article, public traffic or pedestrian safety programs, traffic enforcement and intersection improvements.

The authority shall maintain current standards and regulations which shall be available for inspection and copying. 
(c)  The objectives of this division are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the authority wastewater system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the authority wastewater system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW and which will pass through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or which are otherwise incompatible with the system; and 
(3)  To improve the opportunity to recycle or reclaim the wastewater and to dispose of, recycle or reclaim the sludge generated by the POTW. 
(d)  The regulation of discharges into the authority wastewater system under this division shall be accomplished through the issuance of permits, as specified in section 26-64, and by monitoring and inspection of facilities according to this division. 
(e)  The director shall have the authority to promulgate such administrative regulations as are from time to time necessary for the enforcement of this division. 
(f)  To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW. 
(g)  To enable the POTW to comply with its TPDES permit conditions, sludge and disposal requirements, and any other federal and state laws to which the POTW is subject. 
(h)  Administration: 
(1)  The public works director and the director's authorized representatives are authorized to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this division. Additionally, the director and the director's authorized representatives are authorized to make inspections pursuant to this division and to take enforcement action against violators. 
(2)  For the purpose of promoting consistency of enforcement throughout the city's jurisdiction and service area, the director shall promulgate an enforcement response plan. 
(3)  The director shall have the authority to promulgate administrative regulations which are consistent with this division and which are necessary for the proper administration and enforcement of this division.

Sec. 26-60. - Rates for service inside city limits. 
    The following schedules of rates per month, or fraction thereof, shall be the basis for determining charges to customers as specified for rendering wastewater service, where the wastewater produced by such customer is normal sewage and where such customer is located within the city: 
(1)  A minimum charge of twelve dollars and sixty-eight cents ($12.68) shall be charged to all wastewater customers for each residential or business occupancy; provided, however, if multiple occupancies are served with a single water meter, the minimum charge shall be computed at ninety (90) percent of dwelling units, business occupancies or mobile homes, whichever is applicable, times the minimum charge established herein for individual customers. 
For commercial accounts only, an additional minimum or base charge is added as follows: meter sizes of one (1) inch or smaller add two dollars ($2.00) and meter sizes greater than one (1) inch add five dollars ($5.00). The two dollar ($2.00) and five dollar ($5.00) charge shall be computed for multiple occupancy businesses as previously described in this section. 
(2)  A monthly volume charge shall also be charged to all wastewater customers in the amount of four dollars and seven cents ($4.07) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water used or wastewater produced as more specifically set forth hereinafter. 
(3)  A monthly volume charge for residential class customers will be based on the individual customer's average monthly water use during the preceding winter quarter months of December, January and February, but in no event shall the volume used to compute this monthly charge exceed twelve thousand (12,000) gallons. The volumes used to compute these charges are based on the amount of water used by the residential class customer as registered by the meter. Where no preceding winter quarter average is available from records, the water and sewer department shall estimate a volume to be used for this monthly volume charge, such estimated volume not to exceed twelve thousand (12,000) gallons. If the monthly volume of water used by residential class customers for any single month is less than the aforementioned winter quarter average, the monthly volume charge for that month will be based on this lesser volume. 
(4)  The monthly charges to commercial and industrial class customers will be based on total water use as measured by appropriate meters, with the provision that if a customer can show to the satisfaction of the director of public works that a significant portion of the metered water usage does not enter the sanitary sewers, the customer will be charged for only that volume entering the sewers, as determined by a method approved by the director of public works. 
(5)  No sewer service shall be provided to any customer outside the city except on specifically expressed consent by the city council.

(Code 1965, § 26-28; Ord. No. 1349, § 2, 11-12-91; Ord. No. 1853, § 2, 1-14-03; Ord. No. 1993, §§ 2, 3, 8-8-06; Ord. No. 2097, § 1, 2-10-09; Ord. No. 2189, § 1, 1-10-12) 
Sec. 26-63. - Special rules relating to industrial dischargers. 
(a)  Compliance with standards. 
(1)  State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by all dischargers which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this or any other applicable ordinance. 
(2)  No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process water in any way for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this division. 
(3)  The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated. 
a.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
b.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
c.  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
d.  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(b)  Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 26-62 of this division within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, the control authority, or the DCO, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the DCO for review, and shall be acceptable to the DCO before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. 
(c)  Accidental discharges. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city and the control authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. Within five (5) days following such discharge, unless waived by the director, the user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(2)  The director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control slug discharges at the time of SIU determination or within one (1) year. All the activities associated with slug control evaluation and results are to be kept in the industrial user file. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
a.  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
b.  Description of stored chemicals; 
c.  Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by section 26-63(c)(1) of this article; and 
d.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(3)  Each employer shall instruct all applicable employees, who may cause or discover such a discharge, with respect to emergency notification procedure including the proper telephone number of the authority to be notified. 
(d)  Wastewater discharges into private sewer systems. All dischargers who discharge wastewater into a private sewer system shall comply with this division including subsection 26-64(b)(13); provided, however, that flow measurement may be based on metered water consumption. Each discharger shall provide an agreement, signed by the owner of the sewer system, which authorizes the authority's personnel to enter onto the owner's property for purposes of inspection and monitoring of discharger's premises, and for enforcement pursuant to the terms of this division. 
(e)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(1)  Bypass of a discharger's treatment equipment or treatment facility is prohibited and the authority may take enforcement action against the discharger unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastewater, or maintenance during normal periods of downtime. This condition is not satisfied if, in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment, adequate backup equipment should have been installed to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or maintenance; and 
c.  The discharger submitted advanced, written notice of the need for a bypass. 
(2)  The discharger shall submit oral notice to the authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds categorical standards or other discharge limits within twenty-four (24) hours of the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. Written notice shall be provided within five (5) days of the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. The written notice shall include a description of the bypass and its causes, duration of the bypass, steps taken to prevent the reoccurrence of the bypass, and must be signed by the authorized representative of the discharger. 
(3)  The authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if it determines that the bypass will meet all of the conditions of paragraph (1) above. 
(f)  Notification of hazardous waste discharges. All dischargers shall notify the authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the Texas Water Commission Hazardous and Solid Waste Division Director, in writing of any discharge into a POTW of any substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Any notification under this paragraph must be submitted in conformance with 40 CFR Part 403.12(p).

d.  In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the DCO. 
(3)  Ninety-day compliance report. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance by the discharger with applicable categorical pretreatment standards of ninety (90) days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. This report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger. 
(4)  Periodic compliance reports. 
a.  Periodic compliance reports for facilities discharging to the Trinity River Authority Wastewater Treatment Facility. Any discharger subject to a categorical pretreatment standard made a part of this division shall submit to the authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the categorical pretreatment standards hereof. Reports are required after the compliance date of such a pretreatment standard, or in the case of new discharger, after commencement of the discharge, and are to be submitted on dates as specified by the authority. 
In addition, where applicable, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow specified in section 26-64(b)(2)a., hereof. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided, however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the authority may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The authority, taking into consideration extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of said reports on months other than those specified above. 
b.  Periodic compliance reports for facilities discharging to the City of Fort Worth Village Creek Wastewater Treatment System. 
(i)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the Regulatory Authority but in no case less than twice per year (covering the six-month period December 1 through May 31 and the six-month period June 1 through November 30), submit a report containing at a minimum: 
1.  The nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards; 
2.  The measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period; 
3.  In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user; and 
4.  Contributing information as is determined necessary to account for water usage, materials recovery, or disposal practices. 
(ii)  All non-significant categorical industrial (NSCIU) users shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the authority. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements. 
(iii)  If the director has determined that a non-significant industrial user (NSIU) needs a permit, then the NSIU shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the authority. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements. 
(iv)  All periodic compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with section 26-64(d)(11) of this article. 
(v)  All wastewater samples shall be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring equipment in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(5)  Analysis and sampling procedures. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the approval authority (EPA administrator). Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the city or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by EPA. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where EPA determines that the Part 136 techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by EPA. 
a.  Except as indicated in section b., below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the DCO and/or control authority may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be used to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
b.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
c.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports, (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. 
d.  For periodic compliance reports (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
e.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. Chain-of-custody forms must be submitted with monitoring data. 
(6)  Reporting additional monitoring. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the authority, using the procedures prescribed in paragraph (5) of this subsection, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the periodic compliance report or as required by the permit. Chain-of-custody forms must be submitted with monitoring data. 
(7)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the DCO within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the DCO within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the DCO monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the DCO samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(8)  Significant non-categorical industrial user reporting. The following requirements are only applicable for these users discharging to the City of Fort Worth Village Creek Wastewater Treatment System. 
For significant industrial users, an application shall be filed with the director at least ninety (90) days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. 
Non-significant categorical industrial users (NSCIU) and non-significant industrial users (NSIU) shall be required to submit applications at dates specified by the director. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the user for revision. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in paragraph (5) of this subsection. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the authority in lieu of the significant non-categorical industrial user. 
The following requirements are only applicable for these users discharging to the Trinity River Authority Wastewater Treatment System. 
Significant non-categorical industrial users shall submit to the authority at least once every six (6) months (on dates as specified by the authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the authority. For significant industrial users, an application shall be filed with the director at least ninety (90) days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. Nonsignificant industrial users (NSIU) shall be required to submit applications at dates specified by the director. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the user for revision. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in paragraph (5) of this subsection. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the authority in lieu of the significant non-categorical industrial user. 
(9)  Notification of changed discharge. Dischargers shall notify the director and the control authority (City of Fort Worth or TRA) of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ninety (90) days before the change. The following conditions apply: 
a.  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 26-64(a) of this article. 
b.  The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. The director may deny or condition new or increase contributions.

The following requirements are only applicable for these users discharging to the City of Fort Worth Village Creek Wastewater Treatment System. 
(1)  Annual Certification for Non-Significant Categorical Industrial Users-A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user by the director pursuant to sections 26-53 and 26-64(d)(11)(1), must annually submit the following certification statement signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in 40 CFR 403.120(1). This certification must accompany an alternative report required by the director: 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards under 40 CFR ________, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from ________, ___ to ________, ___ [months, days, year]: 
(a)  The facility described as [facility name] met the definition of a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial User as described in Sections 26-53 and 26-64(d)(11)(1); 
(b)  The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements during this reporting period; and 
(c)  The facility never discharged categorical process wastewater on any given day during this reporting period. 
(12)  Permit reissuance. 
a.  A user with an expiring wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with section 86-632, a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit. 
b.  If the user submits an application in compliance with subsection (b), and the failure of the director to reissue a permit prior to the expiration of the previous permit is not due to any act or omission of the user, the expired permit shall continue to be effective and enforceable until reissued. 
(e)  Inspection and flow measurement. 
(1)  Inspection. All facilities shall be inspected and sampled by the city at a minimum of once a year. Facilities regulated under this division are subject to the authority of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Section 308 of the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 3318), as amended, concerning access to information and right of entry onto property for purposes of implementing and enforcing the federal pretreatment program and other applicable provisions of the Federal Clean Water Act. Facilities regulated under this division are subject to the authority of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) under Sections 26.014 and 26.015 of the Texas Water Code, as amended, and Sections 361.032 and 361.037 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, as amended, concerning access to information and right of entry onto property for purposes of implementing and enforcing the State of Texas' pretreatment program and other applicable provisions of the Texas Water Code and Texas Health and Safety Code. If entry is denied or if a person in control cannot be located, the director shall have every recourse provided by law to secure entry. Such recourse shall include the right to obtain a search warrant under the guidelines of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure; and for the purposes of same, any person with enforcement authority under this chapter is hereby declared to be a "health officer." The authority may inspect the facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of this division. The discharger shall allow the authority or its representatives to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours for the purpose of inspection, sampling, or examination of records. All reports and records related to the provisions of this division shall be made available for copying and inspection by the authority. The authority shall have the right to set upon the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, and metering or measuring operations. The inspectors, agents or representatives of the authority charged with the enforcement of this division shall be deemed to be performing a governmental function for the benefit and health and welfare of the general public and neither the authority nor any individual inspector, agent or representative shall be held liable for any loss or damage, whether real or asserted, caused or alleged to have been caused as a result of the performance of such governmental function. The failure or refusal of such owner or discharger to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the disconnection of water or sewer services to the facility. 
(2)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used in computing sewage charges shall be based upon metered water consumption or discharge as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the Hurst Water Department. 
Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director that a substantial portion of the metered water does not enter the sanitary sewer, the director may require or permit the installation of additional approved meters at the owner's expense, to measure the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system. If approved by the director, the measured quantity of water actually entering the sewer system will be used to determine the sewer service charge. 
Any discharger who procures all or part of its water supply from sources other than the Hurst Water Department, all or part of which is subsequently discharged into the sanitary sewer, shall install and maintain at its expense an effluent meter or flow measuring device approved by the director for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing sewer service charges. Such meters or measuring devices shall be read monthly. 
If the director determines that it is not practicable to measure the quantity or quality of waste by the aforesaid meters or monitoring devices, the quantity or quality of the waste shall be determined in any manner or method the director may find practicable in order to arrive at the percentage of water entering the sanitary sewage system of the authority and/or the quality of the sewage to be used to determine the sewer service charge. The industrial waste discharged or deposited into the sanitary sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by the authority. Samples shall be collected in such manner as to be representative of the character and concentration of the waste under operational conditions. The laboratory methods used in the examination of said waste shall be those set forth in 40 CFR Part 136. The determination of the character and concentration of industrial waste shall be made at such times and on such schedules as may be established by the authority. Should a discharger desire a determination of the quality of such industrial waste be made at some time other than that scheduled by the authority, such special determination may be made by the authority at the expense of the owner or discharger. 
(3)  Recordkeeping. 
a.  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements including documentation associated with best management practices. 
b.  Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. 
c.  These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director. 
(f)  Permit modifications. 
(1)  The authority reserves the right to amend any permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by the authority with applicable laws and regulations. The authority may amend any permit for good cause including, but not limited to the following: 
a.  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements; 
b.  Material or substantial alterations or additions to the discharger's operation processes, or discharge volume or character which were not considered in drafting the effective permit; 
c.  A change in any condition in either the industrial user or the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge; 
d.  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the authority's collection and treatment systems, POTW personnel or the receiving waters; 
e.  Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit; 
f.  Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts in the permit application or in any required reporting; 
g.  To correct typographical or other errors in the permit; 
h.  To reflect transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a new owner/operator; 
i.  Upon request of the permittee, provided such request does not create a violation of any applicable requirements, standards, laws, or rules and regulations; 
j.  To incorporate, revise, or revoke new or existing best management practices. 
(2)  All categorical pretreatment standards promulgated and adopted by the EPA after the effective date of this division shall automatically become a part of this division. Where a discharger, subject to categorical pretreatment standards, has not previously submitted an application for a permit as required by subsection (a)(2) above, the discharger shall apply for a permit from the authority within one hundred eighty (180) days after the promulgation of the applicable categorical pretreatment standard by the EPA. In addition, the discharger with an existing permit shall submit to the authority within one hundred eighty (180) days after promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, the information required by subsection (c)(1) above. The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(g)  Confidential information. 
(1)  All information and data submitted by a discharger to the POTW may be submitted to any state of federal agency governing the POTW. Such information shall be considered subject to public disclosure, provided, however, that the discharger may request that information not be subject to public disclosure, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 2 as follows: 
a.  A discharger may assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information in a manner described below, and that information covered by such a claim will be disclosed only by means of the procedures set forth below. 
b.  If no claim of business confidentiality is asserted, all information will be subject to public disclosure without further notice to the discharger. 
(2)  Method and time of asserting business confidentiality claim: a discharge which is submitting information to the authority may assert a business confidentiality claim covering the information by placing on or attaching to the information, at the time it is submitted to the authority, a cover sheet, stamped or typed legend, or other suitable form of notice employing language such as "trade secret," "proprietary," or "company confidential." Allegedly confidential portions of otherwise nonconfidential documents should be clearly identified by the discharger, and may be submitted separately to facilitate identification and handling by the authority. If the discharger desires confidential treatment only until a certain date or until the occurrence of a certain event, the notice should so state. 
(3)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the disclosure of information and data regarding the nature and content of a discharger's effluent, and the frequency of discharge, or a standard or limitation to be met by the discharger, and this information shall be available to the public with no restrictions. Effluent data which cannot be held as confidential is as defined in 40 CFR 2.302. 
(4)  The provisions of this section shall be subject to any public disclosure requirements which may exist under Article 6252-17a, V.A.C.S. 
(Code 1965, § 26-30; Ord. No. 1151, § 2, 9-25-86; Ord. No. 1349, § 3, 11-12-91; Ord. No. 183, § 2,1-14-03; Ord. No. 1993, § 5, 8-8-06; Ord. No. 2189, § 1, 1-10-12) 
Sec. 26-65. - Enforcement. 
    The remedies provided for in this division are not exclusive. The DCO may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the DCO may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the DCO is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliance user. 
(a)  Notice of violation. 
(1)  When a director finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, the director may issue to such person a written notice of violation. 
(2)  No later than the tenth day after receipt of the notice, the violator shall submit to the issuing director an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of a reoccurrence of the violation. Such plan shall include specific actions to be taken by the violator. 
(3)  If the violator denies that any violation occurred, or contends that no corrective action is necessary, he shall submit to the director no later than the tenth day after receipt of the notice, a written explanation of the basis of any such denial or contention. 
(4)  Submission of an explanation and/or plan in no way relieves a violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(5)  Issuance of a notice of violation shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a violator. 
(b)  Nonemergency termination/revocation of permit. The authority may revoke the permit or terminate water or sewer service of any discharger which fails to: 
(1)  Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(2)  Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or characteristics; 
(3)  Allow reasonable access to the discharger's premises by representatives of the authority for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; 
(4)  Pay sewer charges; 
(5)  Meet compliance schedules; or 
(6)  Fulfill the conditions of its permit, or this division, or to obey any final judicial order with respect thereto. 
(7)  Failure to meet effluent limitations; including best management practices, based on applicable pretreatment standards. 
(8)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this division, individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(9)  Whenever the authority finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies revocation of a permit, pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, the authority shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger a written notice, either by personal delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within ten (10) days of the date of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond in person or in writing to the authority, advising of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. Where the violation of subsection (a) hereof is not corrected by means of administrative adjustment, the authority may order any violating discharger to show cause, before the authority or its duly authorized representative, why the proposed permit revocation action should not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal services, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the authority or its designee regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the discharger to show cause before the authority or its designee why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer, or authorized representative of the discharger. The authority shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities, if any. 
(d)  Administrative orders. 
(1)  Consent order. 
a.  The director may enter into a consent order, assurance of voluntary compliance, or similar agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance with any provision of this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder. 
b.  Such agreement may include specific action to be taken by the violator to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the agreement.

f.  Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a violator. 
(e)  Judicial remedies and penalties. The authority, with respect to the conduct of any discharger contrary to the provisions of this division may authorize its attorney to commence any legal action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable and/or legal relief. 
(1)  Criminal remedies. 
a.  An offense as defined under this chapter is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000.00). Each separate occurrence of a violation or each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
b.  If an offense defined under this chapter does not include a culpable mental state, then one (1) is not needed and the offense shall be one (1) of strict liability. 
c.  An offense is so defined in this Code by the phrase: "A person commits an offense...." 
(2)  Civil remedies. 
a.  The city may invoke Sections 54.011-54.017 of the Texas Local Government Code and petition the state district court or the applicable county court at law, through the city attorney, for either injunctive relief, civil penalties, or both injunctive relief and civil penalties, whenever it appears that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter that relates to: 
(i)  The preservation of public safety, relating to the materials or methods used in construction of any structure or improvement of real property; 
(ii)  The preservation of public health or to the fire safety of a building or other structure or improvement; 
(iii)  The establishment of criteria for land subdivision or construction of buildings, including street design;

(vi)  Point source effluent limitations or the discharge of a pollutant from a point source into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) or MS4. 
b.  Pursuant to Section 54.016 of the Texas Local Government Code, the city may obtain against the owner or the operator of a facility, a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, that: 
(i)  Prohibits any conduct that violates any provision of this chapter that relates to any matter specified in subsection (2)a., above; or 
(ii)  Compels the specific performance of any action that is necessary for compliance with any provision of this chapter that relates to any matter specified in subsection (2)a., above. 
c.  Pursuant to Section 54.017 of the Texas Local Government Code, the city may recover a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each violation of any provision of this chapter that relates to any matter specified in subsection (2)a.(i)-(v) above, and a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day for each violation of any provision of this chapter that relates to any matter specified in subsection (2)a.(vi) above, if the city proves that: 
(i)  The defendant was actually notified of the provisions of the chapter; and 
(ii)  After the defendant received notice of the chapter provisions, the defendant committed acts in violation of the chapter or failed to take action necessary for compliance with the chapter. 
d.  The city may also institute suit to recover the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city, and any costs of response, remediation, abatement, and restoration incurred by the city as allowed under state or federal laws, or at common law. 
e.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court should take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the violation, corrective actions by the violator, the compliance history of the violator, and any other factors as justice requires. 
f.  Whenever it appears that a violation or a threat of violation of any provision of Texas Water Code § 26.121, or any rule, permit, or order of the commission has occurred or is occurring within the jurisdiction of the City of Fort Worth, exclusive of its extraterritorial jurisdiction, the city, in the same manner as the commission, may have a suit instituted in a state district court through its city attorney for the injunctive relief or civil penalties, or both, authorized in Texas Water Code § 26.123(a), against the person who committed or is committing or threatening to commit the violation. This power is exercised pursuant to Texas Water Code § 26.124. In any suit brought under this subsection, the commission is a necessary and indispensable party. 
g.  Filing a suit for civil penalties or other remedies shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a violator. 
(f)  Emergency suspension of service and discharge permits. The authority, may, for good cause shown, suspend water or wastewater service to the discharger's facility, when it appears to the authority that an actual or threatened discharge presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the environment, interfere with the operation of a POTW, violate any pretreatment limits imposed by this division or any permit issued pursuant to this division. Any discharger notified of the suspension of the authority's water or wastewater service and/or the discharger's permit, shall within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the authority, cease all discharges. In the event of the failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the authority may commence judicial proceedings to compel the discharger's compliance with such order or may immediately disconnect such discharger's service line from the city water and sanitary sewer system. In the case of emergency disconnection of service, the director shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner or discharger before disconnecting the service line. The party whose service has been disconnected shall have an opportunity for a hearing on the issue of the illegal discharge and the connection as soon as possible after such disconnection has taken place. 
The authority may reinstate the permit and/or the wastewater or water service upon proof by the discharger of the cessation of the noncomplying discharge or elimination of conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above. The city water and/or wastewater service shall be reconnected at the discharger's expense. 
(g)  Upset provision (federal court only). 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense in federal court only to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph c., below, are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the DCO within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
(i)  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(ii)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(iii)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a federal judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(h)  Act of God provision (in state or municipal court only). 
(1)  An event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe is not a violation. 
(2)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof in state or municipal court. 
(3)  In the event that (1) and (2) above has been demonstrated the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(i)  Affirmative defenses to specific prohibited discharge standards. 
Prohibited discharge standards. It is an affirmative defense in federal court to an enforcement action brought against a user for noncompliance with the general prohibition of sections 26-62(d)(8) and 26-62(d)(9) or a specific prohibition of section 26-62(d)(1), (4), (6), (7), or (17), that the user did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(j)  Recovery of costs incurred by the authority. Any discharger who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the authority's wastewater system, shall be liable to the authority for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The authority shall bill the discharger for the costs incurred by the authority for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Failure to pay such bill may result in the termination of water or wastewater service. 
(k)  Preservation of records. All dischargers subject to this division shall retain and preserve for no less than three (3) years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by or on behalf of a discharger in connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the authority pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired. 
(l)  Costs of administering program. The authority may make such charges, known as monitoring and pretreatment charges, as are reasonable for services rendered in administering the programs outlined in this division. Such charges may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Permitting industrial facilities; 
(2)  Inspection; 
(3)  Sample analysis; 
(4)  Monitoring; and 
(5)  Enforcement. 
(m)  Removal credits. Where applicable, the authority may elect to initiate a program of removal credits as part of this division to reflect the POTW's ability to remove pollutants in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.7. 
(n)  Net/gross calculations. The authority may elect to adjust categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in the discharger's intake water, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.15. 
(o)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, or falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this section, shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 1-5 of the Hurst Code of Ordinances.

In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this division or deals with a permit issued pursuant hereto for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply; provided, however, the authority may take any action it deems necessary to protect its wastewater collection and treatment system or to comply with its NPDES permit or to comply with any contract the authority has for the treatment of wastewater. 
(Code 1965, § 26-31; Ord. No. 1151, §§ 3, 4, 9-25-86; Ord. No. 1349, § 3, 11-12-91; Ord. No. 1853, §2, 1-14-03; Ord. No. 2189, § 1, 1-10-12) 
Sec. 26-66. - Generation, transportation and disposal of wastes. 
(a)  Nonhazardous wastes. No person shall vacuum, flush or drain tanks or traps which contain nonhazardous wastes (septic tank, portable toilet, sand or grit, and grease trap wastes) for the purpose of transporting such waste to a site of disposal unless approval has been granted by the authority. All persons desiring to commercially haul such wastes are required to obtain a permit from the authority prior to any operation in the city. Disposal or discharge of sand, grit, grease trap waste or other nonhazardous wastes is prohibited within the city. No waste from outside the city shall be hauled into the city for disposal. All new industrial and commercial facilities shall install and maintain grease or grit traps appropriately sized to prevent discharge of any substance to the sanitary sewer collection system, which is in violation of this section or could result in a blockage of the system. Industrial and commercial facilities where a grease or grit trap has previously been installed shall properly use and maintain the trap in accordance with this section. Industrial and commercial users generating nonhazardous wastes shall be required to maintain records of waste removal and disposal as deemed appropriate by the authority. These records shall be made available for inspection by the authority at any reasonable time. Such users shall only use waste haulers permitted by the authority to operate in the city. 
(1)  Nonhazardous waste generating: 
a.  A generator shall have liquid waste removed from its liquid waste facilities only by a transporter holding a valid permit issued by the director to do so. 
b.  Prior to liquid wastes being removed from its premises a generator shall determine whether the disposer who will be disposing of the waste is permitted or approved for such by the commission. 
c.  A generator shall determine whether its liquid waste contains hazardous waste or Class 1 nonhazardous industrial solid waste, and shall not have hazardous wastes, Class 1 nonhazardous industrial solid waste, or hazardous wastes or Class 1 nonhazardous industrial solid wastes combined with liquid wastes removed from its premises by a transporter operating under a city permit. 
d.  Prior to a transporter leaving a generator's premises with a load of liquid waste, a generator shall sign the original of a city trip ticket prepared by the transporter. 
e.  A generator shall keep a copy of all city trip tickets for liquid waste collected from its premises for a period of five (5) years and shall make such trip ticket copies available to the director for inspection at all reasonable times. 
f.  A generator shall install or provide liquid waste facilities on its premises of such type and size as specified by the director. 
g.  A generator shall maintain its liquid waste facilities as follows: 
1.  Liquid waste facilities shall be maintained in continuous, proper working condition. 
2.  Pumping out of wastes: 
(i)  Grease traps located upon the premises of food establishments shall be one hundred (100) percent pumped out a minimum of every ninety (90) days, and at all other times as necessary to maintain their effectiveness. All liquid, semisolids, solids shall be removed from the trap at each cleaning interval. The director may order a generator to have its grease traps pumped out more frequently than every ninety (90) days if the director determines such is necessary for the protection of the sanitary sewer. 
(ii)  Grit traps shall be one hundred (100) percent pumped out a minimum of twice per year, and at all other times as necessary to maintain their effectiveness. All liquid, semisolids, solids shall be removed from the trap at each cleaning interval. The director may order a generator to have its grit traps pumped out more frequently than twice per year if the director determines such is necessary for the protection of the sanitary sewer. 
(iii)  The director may reduce the cleaning frequency requirement in writing if the director determines, based on written documentation submitted by the generator, that the reduced cleaning frequency does not contribute to or cause a violation of section 26-62, and that the trap shall be cleaned when at least fifty (50) percent of the wetted height of the trap, as measured from the bottom of the trap to the invert of the outlet pipe, contains grease and/or solids. 
(iv)  The director may establish other cleaning requirements for traps as necessary to protect the sanitary sewer collection system and the POTW. 
h.  Liquid waste facilities shall be inspected for seepage into the surrounding media whenever the trap has been pumped. The generator shall repair, replace, or install apparatus and equipment as necessary to ensure the proper operation and function of the liquid waste facilities. 
i.  A generator shall supervise the servicing of the generator's liquid waste facilities, and shall ensure that they are completely emptied by the transporter during such servicing. 
j.  A generator shall maintain records of liquid waste facility inspections for five (5) years, and shall make such records available to the director for inspection at all reasonable times. 
k.  A generator shall report all spills occurring during collection to the director within twenty-four (24) hours. 
l.  A generator shall immediately clean up or cause to be cleaned up all spills of liquid waste and shall have the waste properly disposed of by transporter. 
m.  A person commits an offense if the person is a generator of liquid waste and fails to comply with any provision of this section or any order of the director authorized by this section. 
n.  A person commits an offense if the person is a generator of liquid waste and allows liquid waste that emits noxious odors or offensive odors, or that is creating an unsanitary condition or which is injurious to the public health to accumulate upon premises under the person's control. 
o.  Bioremediation of grease traps. 
1.  A person commits an offense if the person introduces, or causes, permits, or suffers the introduction of any bioremediation media into a grease trap. 
2.  It is an affirmative defense to an enforcement of subsection (1) that the use of the bioremediation media had been approved by the director, and the media and the use of the media met all criteria of subsection (3). 
3.  Bioremediation media may be used with the director's approval if the person has proved to the satisfaction of the director that: 
(i)  Laboratory testing which is valid for the type of grease trap to be used has verified that the media is a pure live bacterial product and does not contain any surfactants, emulsifiers, or substances which act as solvents for fat and the media can perform one hundred (100) percent treatment/digestion of oil and grease under controlled conditions in a set timeframe not to exceed two (2) weeks; and 
(ii)  The use of the media meets the following operational criteria: 
The volume of oil, grease, and water discharged to the sanitary sewer after use of the media will not exceed the volume of oil, grease, and water which would be discharged if the product were not being used and the grease trap were being properly maintained. The total mass of oil and grease discharged to the sanitary sewer after the use of the media will not exceed the discharge limits for oil and grease established in subsection 26-62(e)(1). 
The total mass of oil and grease discharged after use of the media shall be determined by the hourly collection of twenty-four (24) samples per day over a minimum two-week period prior to approval. 
The BOD, COD, and TSS discharged to the sanitary sewer after use of the media does not exceed the BOD, COD, and TSS which would be discharged if the product were not being used and the grease trap were being properly maintained; and the discharge requirements for BOD, COD, and TSS established in section 26-62. 
(iii)  The pH of the discharge is not less than five (5) nor greater than twelve (12).

Sec. 26-67. - Fees and charges. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the city's POTW for the implementation of the program established herein. Laboratory and sampling fees assessed are based on the types of service rendered and categories of analysis. Such fees shall be set forth and established according to the annual budget process. 
(b)  Monitoring, sampling and analytical fees for significant industrial users. These users may be sampled by the authority no less frequently than semi-annually and charged for the laboratory and sampling services. Laboratory and sampling fees assessed are based on the types of service rendered and categories of analysis. Such fees shall be set forth and established according to the annual budget process. 
    Wastewater rate fees (additional fees may be applied): 
BOD strength charge, per pound ..... $0.4160 
TSS strength charge, per pound ..... $0.2736 
(c)  Abnormal sewage surcharges for Group I users. If any individual user is found to be discharging abnormal BOD and/or TSS, they will be charged a monthly surcharge according to the following formula: 
c i = (s o )(s i ) + (b o )(B i ) 
Where: 
c i = surcharge to industrial users in dollars to be added to monthly billing for water and sewer service. s o = total suspended solids strength charges, $/lb. b o = biological oxygen demand strength charges, $/lb. B i = amount of BOD from industrial users, lb/month, in excess of normal allowable limits. s i = amount of total suspended solids from industrial users, lb/month in excess of normal allowable limits.  
    The rate for each user may be calculated once every twelve (12) months or as necessary to accurately reflect the operation of the user. 
    The surcharge will be in addition to the monthly service and volume charges. 
(d)  Fee for Group I users on compliance schedule. Any Group I industrial user placed on a compliance schedule as described in their wastewater discharge permit will pay for the associated sampling and analytical services as follows: 
(1)  The initial sampling which detected violation, unless that sampled was not part of a monitoring program required by the wastewater discharge permit. 
(2)  Sampling at the end of the compliance schedule which will be repeated until the results show the discharge to be in compliance. The authority can require the user to self-monitor its operation and pay a private laboratory for required compliance testing. 
(3)  The industrial user will return to its appropriate sampling schedule when it is again in compliance with established discharge standards. 
(e)  Surcharge for Group II, Classes 1 and 2: 
(1)  The authority will classify commercial and industrial establishments which routinely discharge BOD and TSS concentrations exceeding those established for normal domestic wastewater into Class 1 and 2 categories, as described in subsection 26-64(a)(1). 
(2)  The authority may establish additional classes as deemed necessary to recover costs from other dischargers of abnormal sewage. 
(3)  The authority shall access an industrial surcharge rate for each class group based on waste strength determination established by averaging grab or composite samples, or both, taken from a representative number of establishments in each group and shall apply this rate to the water consumption or metered wastewater as determined in subsection 26-64(d)(2). The authority shall then add the appropriate industrial surcharge to billings for regular water and sanitary sewer service for each establishment classified into a class group. 
(4)  If an establishment contains operations from more than one (1) of the class groups, and the authority determines that the surcharge rate for a particular class group would not adequately compensate the city for its cost of treatment, the authority may assess a surcharge rate based on a proportional average of the class group rates involved or he may require the establishment to be billed for an industrial surcharge computed under the requirements of subsection 26-67(c). 
(5)  The authority may, at any time, revise class group surcharge rates based on analysis of current samples.

Sec. 26-81. - Authority to make extensions. 
    The city may extend water and sanitary sewer mains in the streets, alleys and easements within the city limits in order to permit connections by persons desiring and seeking water service and sanitary sewer service. 
(Code 1965, § 26-38) 
Sec. 26-82. - Pro rata charges established. 
(a)  A charge, which shall be known as the pro rata, shall be made against each lot or tract of land and the owner thereof whose water and sewer line shall be hereafter connected with any water main or sanitary sewer line in the city constructed by a developer with whom the city has contracted for reimbursement of oversizing or constructing water or sewer mains or lines. The charge shall be at a rate per lot or acre as was agreed to by such contract, which charge shall be based on the total evaluated or contract cost divided proportionately by acreage or number of lots served. 
(b)  Pro rata charges shall be collected at the time of platting or, if the city's records do not show that such pro rata charges were paid at the time of platting, prior to issuance of a building permit. 
(c)  Such charges shall be placed in trust funds for the reimbursement of the developer who constructed the line and transmitted to such developer as soon as practicable. 
(d)  Upon the expiration of the pro rata contract for reimbursement of the developer, such charge shall not be collected.

Sec. 26-83. - Procedure-General method. 
(a)  Upon request of the owner of a given lot or tract of land or at the request of his agent, such owner or his agent to hereinafter be known for the purpose of this article as the applicant, accompanied by the payment of the charges due under this division, the city may extend, lay or construct all necessary water and sanitary sewer mains, including necessary appurtenances, a maximum distance of one hundred fifty (150) feet, excluding street intersections, plus the distance cross the frontage necessary to provide the service for which application has been made. The property owner to be served shall be required to pay the charges provided for in this division and shall be entitled to a pro rata reimbursement contract from the city as provided by this division. 
(b)  The owners of all intervening property served by the given main extension shall be required to pay the charges provided for in the pro rata contract at such time as their property is connected to the mains. 
(c)  In applying for the one-hundred-fifty-foot rule, the required extension of the main shall be figured in such a manner as to leave out of the calculations that portion of any main adjacent to property already having other than a temporary water and/or sanitary sewer service and for which the pro rata charges thereon have been paid or credited under the terms of this division. 
(d)  Where two (2) or more individual applicants desire water and/or sewer services and the nearest applicant is more than one hundred fifty (150) feet from a water or sewer main, the city may extend the mains upon payment of the charges due under this division provided there is one (1) customer for every one hundred fifty (150) feet of such extension, excluding street intersections and that portion of the extension adjacent to property already having other than temporary water and/or sewer service. 
(Code 1965, § 26-40; Ord. No. 1287, § 4, 6-26-90) 
Sec. 26-84. - Same-Alternate method. 
    At the option of the city, the following method for extending mains may be used where a single applicant's property is more than one hundred fifty (150) feet from an existing water and/or sewer main. This method shall be available only for use by an individual, personal or corporate, to secure water and/or sewer service for the individual's residence or business. Where eligible for option, the owner may pay the charges provided for in this division on all property served by the desired main extension, less the one hundred fifty (150) feet allowable and execute a refunding contract with the city. When any property not belonging to the applicant, for which he has advanced the charges, is connected to main extension, then sums as provided by contract shall be collected from such property owners and refunded the party paying as provided. 
(Code 1965, § 26-41; Ord. No. 1287, § 4, 6-26-90) 
Sec. 26-85. - Extensions-For subdivisions generally. 
    Water and/or sewer mains may be extended to serve property which has been subdivided or platted for development and resale on the following basis and in accordance with the minimum standards and procedures: 
(1)  Onsite extensions totally within property to be developed. A developer shall defray the entire cost of water and sewer mains and all appurtenances that lie totally within a subdivision except that the city will: 
a.  Credit against water and sewer impact fees the cost of such water and sewer improvements as appear on the impact fee capital improvements plan; and 
b.  In the case of noncapital improvement plan improvements, enter into a pro rata refunding contract for the evaluated oversize cost of any main larger than necessary to serve the property to be developed; provided, however, the city shall not contract for the cost of any main except those larger than eight (8) inches. The cost of oversize mains shall be evaluated as set forth in section 26-87. The size of mains necessary for adequate service shall be determined by the city. 
(2)  Along-site mains lying along one (1) or more sides of a subdivided tract and serving property other than the subdivision for which the extensions are made. For water and sewer mains not on the city's capital improvement plan which serve property adjacent thereto but not in the subdivision for which the extension was made, the developer may request and the city may grant a pro rata refunding contract for a portion of the cost of such line as provided by section 26-82. Where along-site mains on the capital improvements plan serve other property, the developer will receive a credit against impact fees of the same nature as the improvement. 
(3)  Off-site extensions totally outside of property to be developed. Where water and/or sewer facilities are not available to a tract to be developed, mains may, at the discretion of the city, be extended to the subdivision at the expense of the developer requiring such extension. If the mains appear on the capital improvements plan upon which the water and/or sewer impact fees are based, the developer shall be allowed a credit as provided by the impact fee regulations. If such mains do not appear on such plan, the city will enter into a pro rata refunding contract with the developer to pay the cost of such line at the time it is paid for by the developer whose property it serves; provided, however, the city shall not be obligated to pay more than the amount of actual pro rata charges which it has collected for connections to the line, nor shall refunds be made contrary to section 26-89. 
(4)  Substandard mains area. In an area where a subdivider's property is not adjacent to existing mains meeting current city size specifications but substandard mains are adjacent, the subdivider must reconstruct off-site mains to city specifications and construct mains to city specifications within the subdivision subject to a pro rata refunding contract and/or credits against impact fees. 
(Code 1965, § 26-42; Ord. No. 1287, § 4, 6-26-90) 
Sec. 26-86. - Same-For approved subdivisions. 
    Extensions of water and sewer mains to serve a subdivision to the city, the plat of which has been finally approved by the city council and filed of record, may be constructed in the following manner: 
(1)  By private contract. Upon approval by the city, a developer of an addition may design and prepare construction plans of water and/or sanitary sewer facilities to serve the subdivision, including any access to off-site facilities that may be required. 
    Plans and profiles submitted by the developer's engineers shall be prepared on standard twenty-four-inch by thirty-six-inch sheets. Plans and profiles shall be shown at scales of one (1) inch to one hundred (100) feet or larger horizontal and one (1) inch to six (6) feet or larger vertical. The engineer who submits plans and profiles must be a registered professional civil or sanitary engineer in the state, and he must affix his seal and signature to all tracings. Upon final approval, these tracings will be returned to the developer's engineer for the purpose of making such prints as he may require. Three (3) copies of the final plans, specifications and profiles together with the reproducible tracings shall be submitted to the city to become part of its permanent files. 
    Upon approval of the plans by the city, the developer may enter into a contract with any individual or may himself construct the system as so planned; provided that the construction and installation of the main shall be supervised by city inspectors to see that the installation is made in accordance with the plans and the city's standard specifications which shall be a part of the installation contract. When the project is ready for construction, line and grade stakes will be set by a registered professional engineer or a registered public surveyor. 
    Upon acceptance of the contract and before construction of the project, four (4) percent of the total contract price shall be paid to the city to defray the costs of inspection. 
    Any such installation when made shall become the property of the city free and clear of all encumbrances, and any contract entered into between the developer and a contractor shall provide for a separate maintenance bond in the amount of one hundred (100) percent of the contract for a minimum period of two (2) years or a blanket maintenance bond in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) of construction for a minimum of two (2) years. The city shall be named as one (1) of the obligees in such bond. 
    If the developer makes the installation himself, then he shall execute such bond in favor of the city in the same form and conditioned in the same manner as provided for in the standard contract documents used by the city. 
(2)  Credits. For extensions which appear on the capital improvements plan upon which impact fees are based, the developer shall be entitled to a credit as provided in impact fee regulations for those extensions constructed or paid for by the developer.

    The district is further intended to maximize the potential for job growth, increase property values, and enhance the city's urban image as viewed from the state Highway 183 corridor and from surrounding areas. It specifically encourages those uses that will stimulate retail and business activity, maximize the economic use of available land within the district, and encourage the redevelopment of land in certain areas in a manner that perpetuates the overall "vision" for the Town Center.

(10)  Landscaping requirements. 
a.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to describe the general landscaping conditions and requirements which will improve the appearance of certain setbacks, yard areas and off-street vehicular parking areas, and which will protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of the surrounding area in order to promote the general welfare by providing for the installation and maintenance of landscaping for screening and other benefits. 
b.  Landscaped buffer strip. All lots within this district will be required to provide and maintain a landscaped buffer strip (exclusive of driveways approved for ingress and egress) along State Highway 183, Precinct Line Road, Harwood Road, Campus Drive, Thousand Oaks Road and Hurst Town Center Drive. The landscaped buffer shall have a minimum width of ten (10) feet behind the right-of-way line (i.e., located on the site) plus the parkway area located between the street right-of-way line and the curb. The landscaped buffer strip shall be dedicated to the city as a sidewalk and landscape easement for the possible future placement of meandering sidewalks, landscaping and pedestrian amenities. 
Trees shall be provided along all street frontages within the required buffer strip in a similar manner (and approximately the same spacing) as those currently in existence along the eastern portion of Thousand Oaks Road such that this street tree theme is perpetuated along all perimeter and interior streets.

(Ord. No. 1749, § 2, 11-28-00) 
Sec. 27-15.4. - Mixed-Use Planned Development Overlay District. 
(a)  Purpose of district. The Mixed-Use Overlay District (referred to as MU District, the Overlay, or MU-PD) is meant to encourage higher density mixed-use development with an above-grade residential or office component for new projects, pedestrian-friendly site design, and an urban main street character, in order to increase pedestrian traffic, reduce vehicular traffic, promote innovative use of space, promote energy efficient design, conserve land, and accommodate a range of compatible land uses through appropriate site design. Mixed-Use Overlay Districts are intended to provide areas in which a variety of housing types exist among neighborhood-serving commercial and institutional uses and employment opportunities. The Mixed-Use Overlay District encourages the development of compact, pedestrian-scaled, mixed-use neighborhoods and commercial centers. It is intended to help advance revitalization initiatives along commercial corridors and recognizes the market demand for new residential and commercial development within compact, pedestrian friendly districts. Mixed-use zoning is intended to work in conjunction with the proactive development of pocket parks and plazas, open spaces, and the creation of public spaces within the districts. Mixed-use zoning can support commercial corridor redevelopment plans and urban design guidelines or standards that require high quality development that is consistent with the character of the district. It specifically discourages those uses that promote a strip center development pattern, promote idle land and too much parking, and detract from the image enhancement intentions of this district. These purposes constitute the spirit and intent of the mixed use overlay district. 
(b)  Site plan required. All properties identified as being part of the overlay district (in Exhibit 1 to Ordinance No. 1932) shall be designated Mixed-Use Planned Development Overlay District (MU-PD) or Mixed-Use Special Planned Use District (MU-SPUD) depending on size. A site plan is required for all PD or SPUD properties. Grouping of uses permitted in other districts to create developments of compatible and mutually supportive activities is encouraged. mixed-use projects shall be treated as a zoning district change and shall be processed in accordance with the same review, public hearing, and notification procedures as are required for a proposal for a zoning district change. 
(c)  Permitted uses. Uses permitted in the Mixed-Use Overlay District include all the permitted uses of the following districts as listed in this chapter with exceptions as noted: GB (General Business), R-3 (Residential Apartment) districts including townhouses, condominiums, and loft style apartments; RH (Retirement Housing) use (1)c. multifamily retirement apartments, AL (Assisted Living District), O-1 and O-2 (Office), NB (Neighborhood Business), and LB (Limited Business). The general conditions of the MU District shall override the general conditions enumerated in this chapter for each of the defined districts and any of the special development controls of this chapter when in conflict with the MU District regulations. Additional permitted uses include bed and breakfast lodging, art gallery, museum, recreation centers (whether indoor or outdoor, public or private), pedestrian sky bridges, and bus transit stops. However, GB uses (2) auto maintenance and minor repair, (14) drive through restaurants and financial institutions, and (25) coin-operated amusement machine arcades are not permitted except as considered for conditional use permits incorporated into larger projects. 
    A mixed-use project as defined herein is permitted by right if all general conditions are met on an approved site plan. Non-mixed-use proposals with permitted uses or single-use buildings, requesting to use more traditional development standards for parking, setbacks, single uses, and other issues shall be submitted for conditional use permits as defined in subsection 27-15.4(d) and with requests for modifications to the mixed-use general conditions as defined in subsection 27-15.4(g). 
(d)  Conditional uses. Some types of uses, due to their unique nature, are subject to additional controls. Certain uses may not be specifically listed in existing zoning districts but may be considered for conditional use permits if they meet the general purposes of the Mixed-Use Overlay District. Such uses must be shown by site plan and adherence to design standards to be compatible with the surroundings. Such uses may include, but are not limited to single-family detached housing, auto maintenance and minor repair, gasoline sales as an accessory use, drive through uses (restaurants, financial institutions, pharmacies, dry cleaners), multi-family housing density over eighteen (18) units per acre, single use retail or office buildings, bowling alleys, skating rinks, hotels, inns, laundries, washaterias, and employment uses such as contractor services (e.g. plumbing, electrical, mechanical), technology services, telecommunications services, assembly of products from components delivered to the site from off site (but not manufacturing), and indoor/overnight kennels within a veterinary clinic with noise suppression walls. No outside storage of supplies or products is allowed for conditional uses. 
(e)  Uses not permitted. The following uses are specifically not permitted: 
(1)  Outdoor Commercial (OC) District uses unless listed in subsection (d) conditional uses. 
(2)  Strip retail centers with front yard parking fields. 
(3)  Bars. 
(4)  Medical, infectious, pathological, or general waste incinerator.

(16)  One-story duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes. 
(17)  Suburban style, garden apartment complexes. 
(f)  Existing nonconforming uses, buildings, structures, and lots. A use, building, structure, or lot that was legally constructed and/or platted, or a land use that was lawfully operating, prior to the effective date of this section was applied to specific areas as shown on Exhibit 1 to Ordinance No. 1932 shall be deemed to be nonconforming to applicable portions of the Mixed-Use Zoning District regulations, and shall be allowed to continue provided that it is not expanded, enlarged, razed and/or reconstructed, moved, or otherwise modified from its original footprint. Lease spaces within an existing nonconforming building or use may be reoccupied so long as the building is not modified from its original footprint. If the use of the entire building, structure, lot or land use is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) months or longer, any future use or redevelopment of said premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this section. A vacancy does not constitute a discontinuance or abandonment of the nonconforming use, building, structure or lot (the use) provided the owner expresses its intent to continue the use by seeking tenants and taking any other steps that reflect an intent to continue the use. No nonconforming use or structure may be expanded or reoccupied with another nonconforming use following the effective date of this section. 
(g)  General conditions and design guidelines. 
(1)  Area requirements: 
a.  Minimum lot size. Lots within this mixed-use zoning district should be at least forty three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square feet in area. 
b.  Minimum lot width. Lots within this zoning district should be at least one hundred thirty (130) feet in width, measured at the front building line. 
c.  Maximum coverage. No maximum coverage is specified. A denser, more urban style of development is expected. The developer must justify the lot coverage requested in the PD site plan and insure that the relationship of building to lot is reasonable and in keeping with the stated purposes and spirit of the mixed-use district, including but not limited to appropriate set backs, open space, buffers, yards, circulation, fire protection, and parking needs. 
(2)  Multifamily standards. These standards shall apply whether the housing units are apartments, townhouses or, condominiums, and whether for sale or rent. 
a.  The design of multifamily developments shall contribute to the urban character and architectural diversity of the mixed-use district. The same exterior design shall not be used for greater than twelve (12) units and/or more than two (2) buildings. Architects shall utilize a variety of compatible exterior materials, building styles, massing, composition, and/or prominent architectural features. 
b.  Minimum dwelling unit size. Every dwelling unit hereafter erected, constructed, reconstructed or altered in this district shall have a floor area exclusive of breezeways, basements, open and screened porches, corridors, parking area, garages and accessory buildings of not less than the following: 
1.  Efficiency as defined in this section - five hundred (500) square feet. (No more than thirty-five (35) percent of the total apartments shall be efficiencies); 
2.  One (1) bedroom - seven hundred (700) square feet; (No more than forty (40) percent of the total apartments shall be one-bedroom except that one-bedroom units may increase by the number of units efficiencies are decreased); 
3.  Two (2) bedroom - Nine hundred (900) square feet; 
4.  Three (3) bedroom - One thousand (1,000) square feet; 
5.  Loft style - One thousand one hundred (1,100) square feet. 
c.  Special regulations for townhouses, and condominiums as defined in this section: 
1.  Each dwelling unit shall be on a platted lot. Condominium units may be sold and owned individually within the same building or project. 
2.  Minimum floor area per dwelling unit: 850 square feet exclusive of garage if provided. 
3.  Minimum widths of lot: 25 feet. 
4.  Minimum depth of lot: 90 feet. 
5.  Public open space or plazas not required if individual, back yards or gardens are provided. 
6.  Each dwelling unit shall have an enclosed garage with a minimum of two (2) parking spaces, except that second and third floor units can be assigned carports or uncovered, outdoor parking. 
7.  Rear entry garages are preferred. Swing or side entry garages may be considered if rear garages can be shown to be incompatible with a project's layout and design. The elimination of the garage space by enclosing it with a wall shall be prohibited. 
(3)  Yard requirements: 
a.  Front yard. There is no minimum front yard or setback. The maximum front yard is the smallest possible distance that meets the requirements for buffer zone and pedestrian zone in the curb-to-building area, except for any area in the front yard that meets the qualifications for a pedestrian plaza as approved by site plan, and also accounts for needed parking in accord with subsection 27-15.4(g)(6)d. Part of the front yard may be used for a pedestrian plaza. A plaza may have a maximum depth of fifty (50) feet (measured perpendicular from the frontage to the opposite side of the plaza) and a maximum length (measured along the side of the plaza parallel to the frontage) of twenty (20) percent of the length of the building along the frontage. 
b.  Sidewalks. Sidewalks or other approved pedestrian designs are required along all yards facing public streets, except that this pedestrian path may be incorporated into plazas. 
c.  Side yard. No side yard is required on a side of the lot that is contiguous to a lot zoned GB, LB, O1, O2, OC, TX10, or MU; however, if a side yard is provided, it must be at least five (5) feet wide. 
d.  The minimum side yard is ten (10) feet on any side of a lot where that side of the lot abuts a public street (unless parkway and sidewalk are provided from street right-of-way to building line), or the new or existing abutting building has facing windows. 
e.  Rear yard. Every building within this district shall have a minimum rear yard setback of twenty-five (25) feet from contiguous property line or the actual setback in existence at the time of approval of this chapter, whichever is less. Approved fire lanes may be located in this space. 
f.  If the proposed building height exceeds one (1) story or twenty (20) feet, every such building within this district built on property contiguous to residential zoned property shall have a sufficient rear or side setback combined with architectural and landscape features to buffer the residential use. Forty-five-degree height planes (as shown in Figure 1 to Ordinance 1932) shall be followed as part of the buffering between two-plus story buildings and contiguous single-family uses. A second story is not permitted at the twenty-five-foot rear yard setback line adjacent to single-family uses. Rear-facing walls of residential units should use skylights and opaque windows for light and avoid rear-facing windows as much as possible. Efforts should be made to orient rear walls and roof top terraces to protect the privacy of contiguous single-family uses. 
g.  No outside storage shall be allowed within twenty-five (25) feet of the common property line of single-family zoned property, unless fully screened with masonry and facing away from the single-family property. 
(4)  Height: 
a.  New buildings shall be no less than two (2) stories. Rooftop terraces do not constitute an additional story. Adaptive reuse projects should attempt to convert existing buildings to two (2) stories where compliance with subsection (3)e. and subsection (3)f. is possible. Three-story buildings are encouraged if fronting on major commercial corridors and the forty-five-degree height plane can be met. 
b.  Contiguous to single-family uses, after compliance with subsection (3)e. and subsection (3)f., height should be limited to thirty-five (35) feet, or two (2) stories, whichever is less, for single-use buildings; or forty-five (45) feet or three (3) stories, whichever is less, for mixed-use buildings. 
c.  In addition, a transitional height plane of forty-five (45) degrees shall apply to portions of a building above forty-five (45) feet or three (3) stories, whichever is less. Any portion of a building above forty-five (45) feet or three (3) stories, whichever is less, shall be set back so that the building does not encroach the transitional height plane; i.e., the portion of a building above forty-five (45) feet or three (3) stories must be set back an additional foot for each additional foot in height. This standard is illustrated in Figure 1. These supplemental building setback and transitional height plane requirements shall not apply to buildings contiguous to one- or two-family districts that serve as public open space, such as parks and drainage ways. 
Figure 1. Additional Setback and Transitional Height Plane 
Figure 1 Additional Setback and Transitional Height Plane 
d.  Maximum heights: No building in this district shall exceed forty (45) feet in height or three (3) stories, whichever is less, except sixty-five (65) feet or five (5) stories, whichever is less, may be approved if all of three (3) conditions are met as follows: (i) The site is deemed to be conducive to additional height without negatively impacting contiguous properties, for example, contiguous properties are higher or lower in elevation than the proposed building site or sufficiently set back or located across a street or of a compatible use; (ii) Residential uses constitute twenty (20) percent or more of a building's gross floor area; and (iii) office, eating and entertainment, and/or retail sales and service uses constitute ten (10) percent or more of the building's gross floor area, or all of the ground floor space fronting the building's primary public street to a depth appropriate for the use. 
e.  Building height for all uses shall be measured from the top of the finished slab at grade level to the top of the highest wall top plate, but the slab shall not be artificially set higher than nearby properties. 
(5)  Orientation and building access: Entrances - Principal buildings within mixed-use districts shall be oriented toward public streets or easements in order to create a pedestrian-oriented environment. A principal building must have its main entrance from a public sidewalk or plaza, or from a private sidewalk or plaza that is publicly accessible through a public use easement. The main entrance shall not be from a side parking lot. Secondary entrances from side parking lots are permitted. Interior buildings constructed as part of a campus development are exempt from these requirements. However, the street-facing portion of an interior oriented building cannot be built as a monolithic wall facing the street. Architects shall utilize a variety of compatible exterior materials, building styles, massing, composition, articulations, and/or prominent architectural features to break up such street facing walls similar to the design standards in subsection (9). 
(6)  Screening: 
a.  As part of any Mixed-Use District project, existing wooden fences on the mixed-use site between commercial and residential properties must be replaced with approved walls, fences, or vegetative screening as described herein if the existing fence is ten (10) or more years old or in a state of disrepair as determined by the administrative official. Disrepair is defined as faded, cracked, peeling, missing planks, broken planks, rotten, or mounted on wooden poles. If less than ten (10) years old or in reasonably good repair, the owner must replace the existing wall/fence with an approved screening device within five (5) years of approval of the MUZ project. 
b.  Screening fence and wall requirements. Pedestrian access from contiguous residential and commercial streets is encouraged. MU-PD applicants shall document an attempt to involve nearby residents in project development and offer outreach meetings with contiguous residential owners and tenants. City staff shall assist in this process. The applicant must strike a balance between the need for residents' security and the type of interaction with its settings that mixed-use development promotes. Rather than front facing perimeter walls, applicants should place needed security walls/fences between buildings with security gates at breezeway entrances, for example. Walls or fences should not extend beyond building fronts. Where used, especially for rear yard screening, fences and walls shall be erected to a height of not less than six (6) feet in height nor greater than eight (8) feet in height unless otherwise provided. If used, screening fences or walls shall be permanently and adequately maintained by the owner of the property on which the fence is required to be erected. Only the following types of walls or fences shall qualify as a screening fence or wall required by this zoning district: 
1.  Masonry wall or fence. Masonry fences or walls shall be constructed with the same quality of decorative finish on both sides and of any of the following materials: Native stone, brick, and pre-stressed concrete panels with decorative finish or decorative concrete masonry units. Common smooth-face masonry units are prohibited. 
2.  Ribbed metal panel fence. Suitably finished to blend with the primary structure and supported by a structurally sound metal frame. 
3.  Wrought iron or combinations of wrought iron, masonry, and/or landscaping. 
4.  Decorative vinyl. Suitably finished to blend with the primary structure and supported by a structurally sound frame acceptable to the administrative official. 
5.  Vegetative screening. Using approved plants and fence materials, vegetative screens may be proposed. 
c.  Screening of roof-mounted equipment. All roof-mounted equipment, which rises above the roofline of any building or structure, shall be screened from view of any public street or contiguous residential area with a building material consistent and compatible with the building. 
(7)  Exterior wall surfaces: All buildings shall have exterior walls of not less than seventy-five (75) percent masonry surface on all levels. Only the following materials shall be considered as meeting the masonry requirements of this zoning district: Natural stone, brick, pre-stressed concrete panels, stucco above four feet, and/or concrete masonry units of the following types: Split-face, fluted, castle rock, shadow rock, scored and/or glazed. Common smooth-faced masonry units are specifically prohibited unless used in combination with other types of concrete masonry units, must not exceed twenty (20) percent of the area covered by concrete masonry units, and cannot be used on walls facing any public street. Where a retail use occupies the first floor, at least seventy (70) percent of the first floor exterior wall facing a thoroughfare, street, boulevard or parking plaza shall be transparent glazing. Glass is to be clear or tinted, not reflective. 
(8)  Parking, loading, and access: The general requirements of section 27-20 apply for parking and loading, but Table 20-3 is superceded by specific requirements in this section. Otherwise, Table 20-3 applies. 
a.  Shared access/cross access shall be provided unless the terrain makes it virtually impossible. Within existing and planned retail centers and contiguous properties, provision to preserve future shared access is required if not provided immediately. Easements and dedications are required to provide and preserve shared access. For shared access that is to be preserved, the developer shall escrow with the city the amount of money estimated to be needed to construct the developer's portion of the shared access. If shared access has been provided or preserved by a contiguous property, subsequent projects on the property that does not have shared access must connect with the shared access that was provided or preserved. 
b.  All streets except major arterials can be used for parallel parking if space and traffic patterns permit. On-street parking shall be provided on every street where feasible, including side streets, and it shall be counted as part of the site's required parking. 
c.  No more than one (1) row of surface parking for commercial uses shall be placed between the building facade and the street curb. The largest percentage possible of surface parking spaces for commercial buildings should be located behind or along side the building. 
d.  Multiple fronted lots: Surface parking on corner lots or other lots with frontage on two (2) or more public streets shall comply with the above placement requirement on at least one (1) street frontage. 
e.  If surface parking is located contiguous to the building, the parking should be screened by a decorative fence, wall or hedge in order to continue the build-to line of the contiguous building facades. 
f.  Parking lots serving businesses contiguous to each other should be connected. Parking lots serving neighborhood retail centers should be no larger than twenty-five (25) spaces. Lots larger than twenty-five (25) spaces should be segregated into multiple, interconnected and landscaped lots. 
g.  If contiguous uses complement one another in terms of the days and time of most concentrated uses, the MU-PD site plan may count shared parking towards off-street parking requirements if written evidence of acceptance of same by contiguous property owners is presented. Staff may require a parking study to document needed parking. Required parking shall be determined based on parking demand for the peak parking period, as determined by a parking analysis study approved by the development manager, if requested by same. 
h.  Off-street parking spaces for the applicable use class shall meet the following minimum number of spaces per square foot of floor space: 
1.  Retail: One (1) space per two hundred fifty (250) square feet. 
2.  Office, business, professional: One (1) space per three hundred (300) square feet. 
3.  Cafe, restaurant, cafeteria, all other eating and/or drinking establishments: One (1) space per one hundred seventy-five (175) square feet. 
4.  Mixed-Use: Number of spaces resulting from application of ratios for all respective uses in the development, after accounting for shared parking potential. 
i.  Structured parking facilities shall be designed so that the only openings at the street level are those to accommodate vehicle entry/exit and pedestrian access. The remainder of street-level frontage shall be designed for retail, commercial, office, or civic uses other than parking. Garages fronting streets should be avoided. 
j.  Facilities to lock bicycles shall be provided for each building with commercial and office uses greater than five thousand (5,000) square feet. 
k.  Paid parking: Parking is generally expected to be free. If parking spaces are provided for a fee on any property within a MU-PD district, the owner or lessee of such property shall remit to the city a franchise fee of fifteen (15) percent of the gross receipts from parking space rentals/sales. 
l.  Parking for housing: 
1.  One (1) bedroom or efficiency: One (1) parking space per unit. 
2.  Two (2) bedrooms: One and one-half parking spaces per unit, except two (2) parking spaces shall be provided for all townhouses or condominiums or loft style apartments. 
3.  Three (3) bedrooms or more: Two (2) parking spaces per unit. 
4.  The above requirements shall apply to situations where only one (1) or two (2) units are included in a building provided that they are located on the second through fourth floors only. 
m.  Additions to existing buildings. Existing parking shall be provided as a minimum for additions to existing conforming buildings. 
n.  Extensions into or over rights-of-way or access easements. 
1.  Outdoor eating areas may extend into rights-of-way or access easements of streets or public ways, if a minimum sidewalk clearance and/or distance to curb line of five (5) feet is maintained. 
2.  Canopies, balconies, stoops, bay windows, awnings, planting beds, signs, and other building projections may extend from buildings if a minimum sidewalk clearance and/or distance to curb line of five (5) feet is maintained at ground level, extending to twenty-five (25) feet of clearance overhead to allow maintenance equipment to safely work in easements or rights-of- way. No permanent fixture is allowed to be built lower than twenty-five (25) feet over or on a right-of-way or easement area. 
(9)  Building design guidelines: 
a.  Developments shall create generally a continuous public edge and streetscape on all frontages by using a combination of the following: 
1.  Building face. 
2.  Low wall, canopy structure, or attractive fence 
3.  Articulated screening wall around service/loading areas to screen trucking activities from pedestrian areas. 
4.  Street furniture. 
6.  Landscaping. 
7.  Berms. 
8.  Incorporation of signage and sidewalks into any of the above. 
b.  Buildings shall be designed to have an identifiable public address that corresponds to the main entrance of buildings. All entrances and exits shall have a continuous pedestrian walkway that is connected to a public sidewalk. 
c.  Pedestrian walkways should be protected from vehicular intrusions with landscaping, curbs, bollards, or other elements integrated into the overall streetscape design. 
d.  A portion of the ground level floor facing the primary street shall provide windows that allow for visibility into stores. 
e.  Blank facades shall not be exposed to public streets. Buildings with long facades (greater than forty (40) feet) should be massed and articulated by design elements including texture, canopies, transparency, and the vertical expression of structural bays so that the scale of the building does not overwhelm streetscapes. 
f.  Buildings shall incorporate traditional horizontal elements such as building based sills, cornices and rooflines to add interest, reduce the massive scale of the building and complement the character of contiguous buildings. 
g.  Large buildings should be articulated by breaking long walls into smaller components, avoiding facade flatness, with projections or indentations, with clearly marked entries, with differentiation between bottom floor, top floor, and the floors in between, and with a variety of roof designs. 
h.  Rooftop and ground floor mechanical equipment shall be screened from public view. 
i.  A variety of materials or exterior treatments are required. The same exterior design shall not be used for more than two (2) buildings. 
j.  Screening through use of masonry walls, landscaping or appropriate combinations is required for all storage, service portals, garbage areas, and service driveways that are contiguous to other properties. 
k.  Parking lots should be laid out to continue the street/block pattern of the area so that the lots can easily be redeveloped with buildings consistent with the urban design of the surrounding development. 
l.  Large surface parking lots shall be screened and broken up visually through landscaping, as provided by subsection 27-21(i), and other elements within the parking area, such as a grid of trees on islands in the lot or segmenting the lot with landscaped areas, as well as utilizing defined walkways. 
m.  Direct, defined, and protected pedestrian routes should be provided through parking lots. 
n.  Convenient bicycle parking shall be provided for employees and customers contiguous to the front doors of the building where possible. 
o.  Large centers should provide a public realm by providing defined public places and activity centers so that varied activities are encouraged. This can be accomplished by the utilization of greens, plazas, and streets fronted by closely contiguous buildings to provide some interest at the pedestrian level. 
(10)  Refuse containers: All refuse and refuse containers shall be screened from view of all public streets and contiguous residential areas by a masonry wall. 
(11)  Noise: In this district, no noise from activities conducted within the business building shall be discernible above the ambient noise level beyond the property line, as provided in section 27-21. Noise generated at outdoor spaces such as music from outdoor restaurant seating must be controlled so as not to become a nuisance to contiguous properties. 
(12)  Environmental controls are subject to the provisions of section 27-21. 
(13)  Urban open space: Common open space shall be reserved for the leisure and recreational use of ALL the project's occupants and readily accessible thereto. Common open space is land area of which at least fifty (50) percent is not covered by buildings, structures or the required parking spaces. Common open space shall be guaranteed by a restrictive covenant describing the open space and its uses, maintenance, and improvement and running with the land for the benefit of occupants or the public. The guideline for urban mixed-use open space is twenty (20) percent of the project area. Landscaping requirements can be incorporated into the open space requirement. The availability and nature of contiguous or nearby public open space and parkland may be considered in making a determination of required percentage of open space. 
(14)  Landscaping: 
a.  A reasonable percentage of the lot shall be maintained in a combination of landscaped and urban open space. The project must adhere to the spirit of the city's landscape requirements in section 27-21. The MU-PD site plan must demonstrate an appropriate balance of open space, landscaping, the use of ornamental planters, and planting boxes. Though a large expanse of landscaping in the front is not an absolute requirement, where appropriate, it will be considered. 
b.  Street Trees: Street trees are required and shall be large shade tree species, having a minimum caliper of four (4) inches at three (3) feet above grade. Trees shall be wrapped or otherwise trimmed to a height of four (4) or higher to prevent blockage of retail establishments and signs by new growth. Street trees shall be planted on twenty (20) foot centers. 
(15)  Signs: Decorative signs are preferred. The project must adhere to the city's requirements in section 27-22. Generally, the hierarchy of permitted signs will be in order appropriately scaled building signs, landscaped monument signs and multi-tenant signs. If requested, neon lighted signs shall be in lieu of the building sign. No more than one (1) neon lighted sign may be permitted per storefront or business window. No neon lighted sign shall cover more than fifteen (15) percent of a business's front window. 
(16)  Lighting: Decorative lighting shall be installed and all lights shall have shielding to control views of the source of light from nearby residential areas. 
(17)  Sale of alcoholic beverages: 
a.  The sale, dispensing and otherwise handling of alcoholic beverages directly to the consumer for consumption on the premises shall be permitted only if incidental and secondary to the sale of food for human consumption on the premises, which shall be construed to mean that at least fifty (50) percent of gross receipts must be from the sale of food for consumption on the premises. This regulation shall not apply to private clubs operating within hotels. 
b.  Alcoholic beverages may be sold only as incident to carry-out food sales, which shall be construed to mean that gross receipts from alcoholic beverage sales shall be less than gross receipts from carry-out food sales. 
c.  There shall be no service of alcoholic beverages to any person within an automobile. 
(18)  Parking and loading area setback: When a Mixed-Use District site lies across the street from property in a residential district, the parking and loading area (other than for required entrances and exits) shall be set back from the property line at least three (3) feet to provide a planting space which shall be permanently landscaped and maintained. 
(19)  Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED): All projects proposed under this district shall demonstrate consideration of design and architectural issues that can decrease the likelihood of crimes against persons using the project. Entries, alleys, driveways, stairways, public and private walkways and other personal safety features should be planned with crime prevention in mind. 
(h)  Planned development regulations. MU-PD and MU-SPUD uses shall be subject to the general conditions and urban design guidelines listed in the Mixed-Use Overlay District; provided, however, that the following general conditions may be specifically modified by the site plan or ordinance adopting such site plan: 
(1)  Minimum lot size. 
(2)  Minimum lot width. 
(3)  Dwelling unit sizes and percentages. 
(4)  Yard requirements and setbacks. 
(5)  Height restrictions. 
(6)  Screening. 
(7)  Parking, access, and loading. 
(8)  Open space requirements. 
(9)  Landscape requirements. 
(Ord. No. 1932, § 1, 10-26-04) 
Sec. 27-16. - PD Planned Development District. 
(a)  Purpose of district. The PD Planned Development District is intended to be used in combination with other districts to permit the grouping of uses of different districts and the modification of certain controls in a manner so as to produce large area developments arranged to better serve community needs, reduce the demands on community facilities and to create larger areas of open space than those generated under normal district controls. 
(b)  Effects of classification. Property may be classified under the PD Planned Development District only in combination with another district and shall be so designated by the letter PD affixed to the code letters of the base district. When the PD designation is so affixed to another base district, and a site plan has been approved therefor, development may proceed in accordance with the provisions of this section. When property carries a PD designation but has no approved site plan or approved conceptual site plan, it may be developed only as an R-1 district without obtaining further site plan approval. Property may be planned for any use permitted for the base district or for permitted uses with or without PD permitted uses. 
(c)  General regulations. 
(1)  Area requirements: The PD district shall have at least five (5) acres. The fact that such property may be platted into smaller lots shall not relieve the owner thereof of such area minimums. 
(2)  SPUD requirements: Sites smaller than five (5) acres may be zoned as a special planned use district (SPUD). A SPUD zoned property shall be subject to all the requirements of PD zoning, except that conceptual site plans need not include the matters required by subsection 27-16(d)(2)(c), and that site plans need not include the matters required by subsections 27-16(e)(8), (10), (11), (12) and (13) unless requested by the staff or the city council. 
(3)  Maximum coverage: Unless limited to a lower percentage by the base district or site plan adopted by ordinance, no more than fifty (50) percent of lots shall be covered by primary or accessory buildings. 
(4)  Yard requirements: In PD district combined with residential districts, the applicable yard requirements for the residential districts apply only to the total site or to the platted blocks within the site. 
(5)  Height limitations: No building in a PD district shall exceed the height limit stated by the site plan. Unless the height limit is stated in the site plan, no building shall exceed the maximum height permitted in the base district. 
(6)  Compatibility: No PD classification or site plan shall be approved unless the city council determines that the planned use is compatible with and appropriate for the immediate area which it will affect. 
(d)  Site plan requirements: 
(1)  A site plan approved by the city council shall be a prerequisite to issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy for any property in the district. A site plan approval request may be heard concurrent with or subsequent to a zoning change request, but not before. 
(2)  Prior to consideration of any site plan of a part of a larger tract under the same ownership which has been previously designated PD Planned Development, a conceptual site drawing for the entire tract zoned PD shall be presented for approval, as in other rezoning cases. A conceptual site drawing shall also accompany any request for PD zoning not accompanied by a final site plan. The conceptual site drawing, as may be amended and approved by the council, shall become a part of such zone change and subsequent site plans shall conform thereto. Such conceptual site drawing shall contain at least the following: 
a.  A scaled drawing, in which not less than one (1) inch is one hundred (100) feet, showing dimensioned boundaries of the property, the location and width of streets and highways adjacent to and on the property, and any other easements thereon or adjacent thereto; 
b.  Elevation contours at at least ten-foot intervals; 
c.  General location and description of existing utility services, including size of water and sewer mains; 
d.  Existing improvements proposed to be retained when the property is developed; 
e.  Undimensioned location and approximate size of proposed buildings; 
f.  Undimensioned drawings showing proposed access points, general location of parking and points of access; 
g.  All proposed uses and their location on the drawing; 
h.  Identifiable watercourses and low area; 
i.  Proposed maximum height of building; 
j.  Proposed landscaped areas; 
k.  Height and elevation of all buildings. 
(3)  Site plan approval: A request for a site plan approval shall be processed in accordance with the same review and hearing procedure as a proposal for a zoning district change. 
(4)  Modification of site plan: The commission may recommend and the council may require such modification of a conceptual site plan or a site plan as will permit the proposed project to exist harmoniously of surrounding areas. 
(5)  Amendments: All site plans approved hereunder may be amended pursuant to the same procedure and subject to the same limitations and requirements as any other site plan would require for original approval. 
(e)  Site plan information. Every application for approval of a site plan under the terms of this district shall contain sufficient information delineating the characteristics of the site, changes in those characteristics, how the development will relate to public services and facilities, and what protection features are included to insure that the development will be compatible with existing and allowable development on adjacent property. The site plan shall show at least the following items of information: 
(1)  The land area included with the site, the land area of all abutting sites and the zoning classification thereof, all public and private rights-of-way and easements bounding and interpreting the site, and the abutting sites which are proposed to be continued, created, relocated and/or abandoned; 
(2)  The proposed finished grade of the site, shown to contour intervals of not to exceed two (2) feet; 
(3)  A description of the proposed site and the boundaries thereof; 
(4)  The location of each existing and each proposed structure on the site, the general category of uses or uses [to] be contained therein, the number of stories, gross floor area, the location of entrances and exits to buildings; provided, however, the city council may waive the requirements for location of proposed structures, of entrances and exits to buildings for residential planned development site plans. All such residential planned development site plans shall reflect minimum floor area, minimum yard area, and maximum height which are to be applicable; 
(5)  The location of all on-site facilities for liquid and solid waste disposal; 
(6)  The location and width of all curb cuts and driving lanes; 
(7)  The dimensions and capacities of parking areas and loading areas; the character and location of illumination facilities for the same; 
(8)  All pedestrian walks, malls and open areas for use by tenants or the public; 
(9)  The location and height of all walls, fences and screen planting, and landscaping;

(3)  Flood control structures; 
(4)  Lawns, gardens and open space. 
(c)  Planned development uses: Private and public recreational areas. 
(d)  Conditional uses: Parking lots and trucking loading areas, provided that construction of such facilities does not reduce the water-carrying capacity of the floodplain. 
(e)  General conditions. 
(1)  Area requirements: The area of all FP Floodplain Districts shall be the boundaries of the 100-year flood as determined by a competent hydrological study. The 100-year flood boundaries shall be defined by mean sea level elevations. 
(2)  Regulations for existing structures: Existing buildings located in a floodplain district at the time of adoption of this chapter may be enlarged, modified, remodeled or substantially improved, provided that such building be modified or anchored to prevent floatation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; that utility equipment be modified to be resistant to flood damage; and that the following methods and practices be applied to the maximum possible extent: 
a.  Thermal insulation used below the first floor level shall be of a type that does not absorb water. 
b.  Adhesives shall have a bonding strength that is unaffected by inundation. 
c.  Doors and all wood trims shall be sealed with a waterproof paint or similar product. 
d.  Water heaters, furnaces, electrical distribution panels and other critical mechanical or electrical installations shall be prohibited below the minimum elevation requirement. Separate electrical circuits shall serve lower levels and shall be dropped from above. 
e.  Plywood used at or below the first floor level shall be of an exterior or marine grade and of water-resistant or waterproof variety. 
f.  Wood flooring used at or below the first floor level shall be installed to accommodate a lateral expansion of the flooring, perpendicular to the flooring grain, without incurring structural damage to the building. 
g.  Basement ceilings shall have sufficient wet strength and be so installed as to survive inundation. 
h.  Paints or other finishes used at or below the first floor level shall be capable of surviving inundation. 
i.  All air ducts, large pipes and storage tanks located at or below the first floor level shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation. Tanks shall be vented at a location above the 100-year flood level. 
(f)  Development regulations.

(Code 1965, Ch. 27, §§ 17.1-17.7; Ord. No. 1306, § 1, 11-27-90; Ord. No. 1763, § 13, 3-13-01; Ord. No. 2002, § 5, 11-28-06) 
Sec. 27-20. - Minimum parking and loading requirements. 
(a)  Purpose of section. It is the purpose of this section to establish the guidelines for off-street parking space consistent with the proposed land use to: 
(1)  Reduce the occurrence of on-street parking throughout the city; 
(2)  Avoid the traffic congestion and public safety hazards caused by a failure to provide such parking space; 
(3)  Expedite the movement of traffic on public thoroughfares in a safe manner and thus increasing the carrying capacity of the streets, reducing the amount of land required for streets and the costs to both the property owner and the city; 
(4)  Insure that provided parking facilities meet basic requirements. 
(b)  Off-street parking spaces required. 
(1)  In all districts, for all uses, there shall be provided, at the time any building or structure is erected or enlarged or increased in capacity, or at any time any other use is established, off-street parking spaces for motor vehicles in accordance with the requirements specified in this section. 
(2)  The off-street parking or loading facilities required for the uses mentioned in these regulations shall be the same lot as the structures intended to be served, on a lot abutting the lot intended to be served, or on a lot separated from the lot intended to be served only by a street not classified as a collector or an arterial by the city's thoroughfare plan. Such parking spaces shall be in a district permitting the use which they serve; provided, however, that in R-3, LB, GB, O-2, O-C, FP and I zoning districts parking shall be allowed for any adjacent use. 
(c)  Parking for existing uses. 
(1)  It is the intent of these regulations to preserve and retain existing off-street parking and loading spaces in at least the minimum amounts as would be required if the existing use of the structure had been established or erected in full compliance with these provisions. 
(2)  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued, no use shall be established or changed and no structure shall be erected, enlarged or reconstructed unless the off-street parking and loading spaces are provided in the minimum amount and maintained in the manner specified in these regulations; provided, however: 
a.  For the enlargement of a structure or for the expansion of a use of structure or land, there shall be required only the number of off-street parking and loading spaces as would be required if such enlargement or expansion were a separate new structure or use; and 
b.  For a change in the use of a structure or land, the number of additional off-street parking and loading spaces required shall be equal to the number required for the new use, according to the schedule below, less the number of spaces which would have been required for the previous use if it had been established in conformance with this section. In no case shall the total number of spaces required to be furnished exceed the minimum number required for the new use. 
(d)  General requirements. 
(1)  Measurements: 
a.  When units or measurements result in requirements of a fractional space, any fraction shall require one (1) space. 
b.  Loading space shall not be considered to supply required off-street parking space, nor shall required off-street parking spaces supply required off-street loading space. 
(2)  Nonparking uses: 
a.  Areas designated for off-street parking shall be used for passenger and commercial vehicles. 
b.  Areas designated for off-street loading shall be used only for the loading and unloading of passengers, equipment, supplies or merchandise. 
c.  In all zoning categories, except R-1 and R-2, parking and loading areas shall not be used for refuse containers; or for the repair, storage, dismantling or servicing of vehicles or equipment; or for the storage of materials or supplies; or for any other use in conflict with the designated parking and loading areas. 
(3)  Access and maneuvering: Provision for access in maneuvering, entrances, exits and driveways shall be required as provided in Chapter 20, Article V of the Hurst Code of Ordinances. 
(4)  Space standards: 
a.  A space ten (10) feet by eighteen (18) feet of floor/lot area with unobstructed access to a public street shall be deemed to be parking space for one (1) vehicle; such space when provided for other than a dwelling unit shall not be required to be greater than nine (9) feet in width. 
b.  Table 20-2 is incorporated in and made part of these regulations and shall be used in determining capacity of off-street parking areas. 
c.  Unless otherwise specified, a space twelve (12) feet by thirty (30) feet of floor or lot area with a clear height of fourteen (14) feet, and with unobstructed access to a public street or private drive, shall be deemed to be loading space for one (1) vehicle. 
(5)  Reserved. 
(6)  Alternative landscaping for parking. Nonresidential uses on sites of one (1) acre or more, when specifically requested by the owner, shall be permitted to maintain not more than twenty-five (25) percent of required parking spaces in landscaped open space. Such landscaped open space may be maintained until the property owner desires to increase the number of parking spaces, or until ninety (90) percent of other parking spaces are observed occupied at any three (3) times during any consecutive sixty-day period, at which time the enforcing officer shall require construction of additional parking spaces. Such additional spaces shall be constructed within six (6) months of the date of written notice by the enforcing officer. All open space and required landscaping requirements shall be based on the maximum required number of parking spaces, rather than the reduced amount shown here. 
(e)  Development standards. The off-street parking or loading facilities required for the uses mentioned in these regulations shall be on the same lot or parcel of land as the structure they are intended to serve or on a lot or parcel of land abutting the lot they are intended to serve. 
(1)  Paving and drainage: All access drives and off-street parking areas shall be paved with not less than five (5) inches of steel reinforced portland concrete or six (6) inches of hot-mixed asphaltic concrete. Either method requires a cement or a lime-treated subbase of six (6) inch minimum depth to adequately provide an all-weather surface as unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Parking areas shall be graded and drained in such manner that runoff shall be properly channeled into a storm drain watercourse, detention area or other appropriate facility. 
(2)  Curbs and islands: Parking areas shall be provided with curbs or raised concrete islands so located that no part of the parked vehicle may extend beyond the property line or touch a building. Such islands shall be required only in lots of thirty (30) or more spaces and shall be constructed of poured concrete at least six (6) inches above the parking lot surface and at least one (1) foot wide. The islands shall be reinforced with two (2) #3 bars six (6) inches apart in the center running the length of the island. The island shall be doweled into the pavement surface. Such islands shall separate each four (4) rows (or two (2) double rows or one (1) double row and two (2) single rows) of parking spaces. As an alternative to raised concrete islands, such separation may be provided by curbed, irrigated landscaped areas. Such islands or landscaped areas shall have openings for required drainage. Plans for parking lot layout showing the location of such islands or landscaped areas shall be submitted to the public works department prior to the beginning of construction. No such construction shall be permitted until the public works department has examined the plans and determined that safety and drainage needs have been met. Wheel stops resting on top of parking lots, whether anchored or not, shall not be used, nor shall rolled asphalt be permitted. 
(3)  Lighting: Any light used to illuminate or identify a parking or loading area shall be placed so as to reflect the light away from the adjacent dwellings and so as not to interfere with traffic-control devices. 
(4)  Pavement marking and signing: All pavement marking and signing shall be in conformance to the design requirements as set forth in the 1971 Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic-Control Devices. 
(5)  Landscaping: If parking and maneuvering space exceeds one (1) acre, at least five (5) percent thereof shall be maintained as landscaped area, with adequate and inconspicuous irrigation systems. It is the intent of this section to require design and construction of parking areas in a manner whereby areas unusable for parking or maneuvering space are landscaped. 
(6)  Fences, walls and screens: Where a fence is not otherwise required, parking and loading areas designed for more than six (6) spaces or berths adjacent to residentially zoned property shall be screened by a solid wall not less than four (4) feet in height. Such wall shall be maintained in a neat and orderly condition. Except for necessary driveways, such wall shall screen the vehicle area along those exposures where the vehicle area adjoins or is across a street or alley from property restricted to residential use. 
(7)  Maintenance requirements: To insure that all requirements set forth in this section are carried forward, it will be the responsibility of the owner of the parking area to maintain the facility. All off-street parking areas shall be kept free of trash, debris, vehicle repair operation or display and advertising uses. At no time after initial approval of the parking area layout can changes be made in the location and number of provided spaces without approval of the city engineer. 
(8)  Visibility triangle and parkway requirements: Parking and loading areas shall be designed and constructed so as to prevent intrusion into or use of the visibility triangle or parkway, as defined in this Code.

The minimum number of spaces shall not be fewer than fifty (50) percent of that required by Table 20-3. 
(h)  Deviations. For parking areas in shopping centers of more than sixty (60) acres, the city council may allow deviations from the requirements of section 27-20(e)(5) concerning landscaping and parking areas, and section 27-20(g), insofar as it requires adherence to Table 20-2 setting forth minimum size of parking spaces. Such deviations shall be allowed only upon approval of a site plan submitted and processed under the same notice, review and hearing procedures as a proposal for a zoning district change. The city council may require additional information, but such site plans shall contain at least the following: 
(1)  A scale drawing, in which not less than one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet, showing the location of existing and proposed structure on the site; the general category of use or uses to be contained therein; the location of entrances and exits to the building; the location and width of all curb cuts; the dimensions and locations of all parking spaces, driving lanes, pedestrian lanes, walls, fences, screen planting and landscaping; 
(2)  A brief statement setting forth the name of the applicant, a legal description of the property and a general description of how the requested site plan differs from the general requirements from which relief is sought. 
(i)  Parking areas for PD complexes. 
(1)  Parking areas for PD complexes including a hotel of more than two hundred fifty (250) rooms and an office building of more than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet may be allowed to deviate from the requirement of Table 20-3 by up to fifteen (15) percent of the number of spaces therein set forth. Fifteen (15) percent of the resulting required parking may be permitted to be reserved on unimproved land with an area calculated at three hundred (300) square feet per parking space until the property owner desires to increase the number of parking spaces or until ninety (90) percent of other parking spaces are observed occupied at any time during any of the three (3) days in any consecutive sixty-day period, at which time the enforcing officer shall require construction of additional parking spaces. Such additional spaces shall be constructed within six (6) months of the date of written notice by the enforcement officer. 
(2)  Should any such unimproved reserved parking be provided as set forth in section 27-20(b)(2), the city may require appropriate deed restrictions on the unimproved portion running in favor of both the owner of the property served and the city.

Sec. 27-21. - Special development controls. 
(a)  Generally. The regulations and development controls of the various districts shall be modified by and be subject to the following provisions and limitations: 
(1)  Lot requirements: 
a.  Lot required. Every building hereafter erected shall be located on a plotted lot recorded in the county records and in no case shall there be more than one (1) main building on such lot, except as provided in this section. 
b.  Multiple structures on lot. In any district, more than one (1) structure for permitted principal uses other than a single-family dwelling may be erected on a lot of record, provided that yard and other requirements of these regulations shall be met for each structure as though it were on an individual lot of record. 
c.  Frontage on street. Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot abutting a public street, and all structures shall be so located on lots as to provide safe and convenient access for servicing, fire protection and required off-street parking. 
(2)  Height limitations: 
a.  General exceptions. The height regulations contained in the district regulations shall not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas, water tanks, ventilators, chimneys or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy. This exception shall not apply to flagpoles, which shall be limited to the height specified for buildings in the district. 
b.  Visibility at intersections. On any corner lot nothing shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision in the visibility triangle, as defined in this Code. (See § 24-21(a)(2)) 
(3)  Temporary uses and buildings: 
a.  Upon application for and receipt from the enforcing officer of a permit, there shall be permitted during the period of any construction project temporary portable buildings providing office space and sanitary facilities for construction personnel, storage of supplies and material; and security fences on the site. No other use shall be conducted in such temporary portable buildings and no manufacturing operation shall be conducted within a temporary portable building when the product of such operation is to be transported off the site for use in construction in another location. 
b.  All accessory buildings shall comply with the city building code, with the exception of temporary buildings as set forth above and movable buildings allowed in R-1 and R-2 districts. 
c.  Except for construction on a lot where a temporary building is to be located, such temporary buildings shall not remain more than one (1) year and such building shall not exceed a maximum of two hundred fifty (250) square feet in size. 
d.  Temporary buildings for use as classrooms shall be allowed as accessory uses for public schools and churches so long as they meet the requirements of all city ordinances, including, but not limited to, the requirements of chapters 5 and 8 of the Hurst Code of Ordinances. 
e.  Temporary use of trailers or shipping containers for the storage of merchandise in conjunction with retail sales establishments will be allowed for a maximum of thirty (30) continuous days provided that a minimum of ninety (90) days have passed since the trailers or containers have been removed from the property. A permit must be obtained from the city prior to placing the trailers or containers on the property. The permit fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per trailer or container shall be paid for each thirty-day period. A maximum of one (1) forty-foot or two (2) twenty-foot containers per ten thousand (10,000) square feet of building space will be allowed. The trailers or containers may not be located in any part of a fire lane, required parking space, maneuvering lane, or visibility triangle. 
(4)  Agricultural and livestock uses: Agricultural and livestock uses may be conducted in any zone; provided, however, neither livestock nor fowl may occupy any lot of less than forty thousand (40,000) square feet. 
(5)  Temporary sales uses: On any property in any district, except those zoned for residential uses, the temporary sales of Christmas trees and other forms of decorative plant materials associated with the celebration of religious events shall be permitted for a period of thirty (30) days prior to the day of such event. On any property in any district, except those zoned for residential uses, the temporary sales of pumpkins shall be permitted for a period of thirty (30) days prior to and including Halloween. Enforcing officers shall issue a permit for such sales when he finds: 
a.  That there is available an off-street parking area, either improved or unimproved, equal to the size of the plant material display and sale area; and 
b.  That the location of parking areas, lighting and sale signs will not constitute a hazard to public travel on the abutting public streets. Trees, stands, equipment, trash, signs and lighting shall be removed by the permit holder within fourteen (14) days after the final termination of sales activities. 
(6)  Temporary outdoor sales: In the GB and GB PD districts, limited outdoor sales will be allowed by permit on individual platted lots of at least ten (10) acres, subject to the following restrictions: 
a.  Application must be made to the building official by the party in charge of the premises where the outdoor sales are to occur. This will ordinarily be the owner or manager of the shopping center, not one (1) tenant of a multi-occupancy center. Such application shall be accompanied by a fee established by the city manager at a level adequate to pay the cost of administering the permit process and inspections necessary to assure compliance with these regulations. 
b.  No more than three (3) permits shall be issued for any lot in any calendar year and at least thirty (30) days shall elapse between permit dates. 
c.  Permits shall be valid for no more than ten (10) days. 
d.  Temporary sales activities, including tents and displays, shall not occupy more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet. 
e.  No displays, sales activities or tents shall be located closer than fifty (50) feet from a street curb. 
f.  No displays, sales activities or tents shall be located within any fire lane. 
g.  No outdoor sales activities shall be conducted between the hours of 9:00 p.m. of any day and 7:00 a.m. on the following day.

i.  The only merchandise which may be sold under such permit shall be that which is customarily sold indoors on the same premises by businesses conducting the sale. Tents, awnings and cash registers will be allowed in permitted outdoor sales areas, and transactions in such areas shall be deemed to be consummated indoors. 
j.  A permittee shall remove all merchandise, tents and sales equipment within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration date of the permit and shall clean the site, remove trash and repair damage to the parking lot. 
(b)  Yard provisions: 
(1)  Accessory buildings: No accessory building shall be located in a minimum required exterior yard. No accessory building shall exceed eleven (11) feet in height if constructed in any required yard. 
(2)  Mechanical equipment: Air-conditioning, heating, swimming pool equipment and similar mechanical equipment shall not be mounted in minimum ten-foot minimum yard spaces. Equipment shall be so placed as to direct motor and fan noise away from the nearest property line. Mechanical equipment on rooftops shall be screened from all adjacent public or residential sites. Existing public schools are exempted from the requirement to screen rooftop-mounted equipment from public or residential sites. New schools or major additions to existing schools must meet the screening requirements of this section. 
(3)  Other yard uses: Fences, walls, poles, posts, customary fixed yard accessories and ornaments, and roof overhangs projecting not more than thirty-six (36) inches may be permitted in any minimum required yard, subject to height limitations and requirements limiting obstruction of visibility in residential planned development districts. The council may approve, as part of the PD site plan, masonry walls higher than noted above in required exterior yards as long as the same do not violate visibility restrictions. 
(4)  Rear yards: Minimum rear yard requirements for residential uses shall not be less than the depth of any dedicated easements abutting the rear property line. 
(5)  Double frontage lots: On double frontage lots (that is, lots which extend through from one (1) street to another), where the required rear exterior yard is not adjacent to a required front yard on an abutting property, the required rear exterior yard shall be reduced to six (6) feet exclusive of dedicated easements, but in no event to be less than ten (10) feet including such easements. 
(c)  Swimming pools: It is the purpose of these provisions to promote the public safety and enjoyment of property rights by establishing rules and regulations governing the location and improvement of swimming pools whether privately, publicly or commercial owned or operated: 
(1)  Permits and approvals: No swimming pool shall be constructed until a building permit has been issued therefor, and shall not be used until a certificate of occupancy has been issued therefor. No building permit and no final certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless the proposed sanitary facilities and water supply comply with applicable local and state health department regulations. 
(2)  Requirements: A swimming pool may be constructed and operated when: 
a.  The pool is not located in any required exterior yard space; provided, however, that on R-1 double frontage lots (that is, lots which extend through from one street to another) a swimming pool may be located in a required rear or side exterior yard as long as no part of such pool lies within ten (10) feet of a property line. 
b.  A wall or fence, not less than four (4) feet in height, with self-latching gates at all entrances, completely encloses either the pool area or the surrounding yard area. 
c.  All lighting of the pool is shielded or directed to face away from adjoining residences. If lights are not individually shielded, they shall be so placed, or the enclosing wall or fence shall be so designed, that direct rays from the lights shall not be visible from adjacent properties. 
d.  No audio system is used for the purpose of advertising the operation of the pool or for the attraction of persons to the premises. This shall not prevent a public address system necessary or useful to the supervision of the pool and the safety of swimmers. 
(d)  Sale of household effects and personal belongings. In connection with the residential occupancy of a dwelling, the tenants thereof may offer their personal belongings and household effects for sale to the general public in a paved drive, a garage or other accessory building; provided, however, the interval between such sales shall be at least six (6) months, and no sale period shall extend for more than three (3) consecutive calendar days. 
(e)  Walls and fences: 
(1)  Permit required: No fence shall be erected or replaced and no required fence shall be removed without a fence permit obtained from the enforcing officer. 
(2)  Fence permit application: A person desiring a permit to erect or remove or replace any fence shall make written application to the enforcing officer, which application shall designate the location of the fence on the lot, the height of the fence and the materials of which the fence is to be constructed. 
(3)  Screening fence required: 
a.  A permanent brick or solid decorative masonry screen fence not less than six (6) feet in height shall be erected prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy on properties zoned MH or R-3 which abut on properties zoned R-1, R-1A, R-2, RPS, RH or AL; and on property zoned MH, which abuts property zoned R-3. No fence shall be required for schools, churches, and public buildings located adjacent to R-1, R-1A or R-2 zoned property. Such screening fence shall be erected along the entire length of the common line between such property or on the property required to erect screening, and it shall be permanently and adequately maintained by the owner of the property on which the screening is required to be erected. 
b.  A permanent brick or solid decorative masonry screening fence not less than six (6) feet in height shall be erected on O-1, O-2, NB, LB, GB, OC or I zoned property which abuts on property zoned R-1, R-1A, R-2, R-3, RPS, U, RH or AL, or which is separated from such property only by a public or private street sixty (60) feet or less in width. Such fence shall be erected along the entire length of the common line between such properties, or if there is an intervening street, along the nonresidential property line closest to the street separating it from the residentially zoned property. Breaks for vehicular and pedestrian access shall be permitted, as well as for preservation of visibility triangles required elsewhere in this Code. Chainlink fencing may be allowed when O-1, O-2, NB, GB, LB, OC or I zoned property abuts major city parks or Tarrant County Junior College. 
c.  Where subdivisions are platted so that the rear yards of R-1, R-1A, R-2, R-3, RPS, RH or AL zoned lots are adjacent to a dedicated roadway in excess of thirty-one (31) feet in pavement width, including curb and gutter, or separated from such a roadway by an alley or service road, the developer shall provide, at his sole expense, a brick or decorative solid masonry wall with a minimum height of six (6) feet located on the street right-of-way line. 
d.  When a brick or masonry fence is erected adjacent to a dedicated roadway the color of the wall shall be uniform and/or compatible on both sides of a thoroughfare between two (2) intersecting thoroughfares. When walls are built in sections, the color shall be as closely similar as possible, but shall in no case be incompatible. 
e.  All brick and masonry screening fences shall be placed on an engineered concrete footing. 
f.  Masonry or brick columns shall be expressed at a minimum of thirty (30) feet on centers and should typically be taller than the remainder of the wall. 
g.  The exterior of all sides of each wall of a screening fence shall be finished with the same material and shall be similar in appearance. Developers are encouraged to create offsets in brick or decorative masonry walls to provide visual variety. 
h.  At development and subdivision entry features, all walls and raised planter beds shall be of brick or decorative masonry construction. In addition to the design of the entry feature must conform to the visibility requirements of Chapter 24 of this Code. 
Developers are encouraged to create offsets in brick or masonry walls to provide visual variety. 
(4)  Safety and appearances: No wall or fence shall be constructed or maintained in such a manner as would endanger the health or safety of the general public. Any fence or wall that is in disrepair, rotted, leaning, missing pieces, or otherwise detracts from the aesthetics of the area, must be repaired, replaced or removed at the property owner's expense. All new wood fences and wood fences being completely replaced must use metal or concrete posts except as otherwise approved by the building official for decorative fences such as vinyl or split rail fences. Fences constructed of barbed wire (except for livestock fences) and walls topped with broken glass or surfaced with like material shall be prohibited, provided, however, a security fence of not less than six (6) feet in height may be topped with barbed wire. 
(5)  Height: Walls and fences hereafter constructed on property used for or restricted to residential uses shall be no greater than eight (8) feet in height, subject to the following limitations: 
a.  The height of a wall or fence shall be the vertical distance between the ground and the top of the fence. In terrain where ground slopes at a grade of ten (10) percent or more, the fence or wall may be built in ten-foot horizontal stair-step sections; the average height of each such section shall comply with the height regulations set forth in this section. 
b.  No wall or fence located in a required front yard shall have a height of more than three (3) feet; provided, however, security fences may be permitted if shown on approved site plans. 
c.  Where residential subdivisions, with a minimum of one hundred (100) lots, are platted so that the exterior yards of two (2) or more lots are adjacent to a dedicated roadway in excess of thirty-one (31) feet in pavement width, including curb and gutters; or separated from such a roadway by an alley or service road, a developer may provide, at his sole expense, a brick or decorative solid masonry wall with a minimum height of two (2) feet located on the street right-of-way line of such oversized street. Such wall shall be permitted only if erected along each lot adjacent to such street. 
d.  Where rigid enforcement of the screening requirements of the zoning ordinance will result in a conflict with section 24-21 of this Code of Ordinances (view and passage obstruction), the view and passage obstruction requirements shall govern. 
e.  Retaining walls shall be permitted for the purpose of protecting property against sliding earth or accidental injury to human life. The height of a retaining wall shall be determined according to accepted engineering principles and the design shall be approved by the city engineer. A fence erected on top of a retaining wall shall be subject to the height limitations above, measuring from the high side of the wall. 
f.  When two (2) adjoining corner lots are situated so that their lot fronts face parallel streets and so that the side exterior yard of one is a continuation of the side exterior yard of the other, such side exterior yard on both lots may be enclosed by a wall or fence having a maximum height above grade of eight (8) feet to the rear of the side exterior yard on each lot. 
g.  Where subdivisions are platted so that side yards of residential lots are adjacent to a dedicated roadway and where a cul-de-sac approaches the paved roadway, but does not intersect with it, the developer may provide, at his sole expense, a brick or decorative solid masonry wall with a maximum height of eight (8) feet located on the street right-of-way line. 
h.  When a corner lot is situated so that its rear interior lot line is common to a side interior lot line of an adjoining lot which fronts on a street not parallel with the street the first lot fronts on, the fence or wall height along the nonparallel street shall be governed by the regulations applicable as though both lots faced the nonparallel street. 
(6)  Fences on double frontage lots: Double frontage lots are to be discouraged; however, if R-1 double frontage lots are contained in an approved plat, the yard on the street which the majority of the houses in such plat front shall be deemed the front yard and the remaining exterior yard may be fenced at the property line, and shall not be deemed the front yard. All other provisions of subsection (e) shall apply. 
(7)  Retaining walls: 
a.  Retaining walls constructed to facilitate a change in grade shall not be located in such a manner that any portion from the footing to the top of the wall crosses a property line. Retaining walls may extend lengthwise across a property line. Retaining walls supporting a structure must be located on the same lot as the structure. 
b.  Retaining walls over one (1) foot in height shall be constructed of masonry or concrete. All retaining walls supporting a structure shall be constructed of masonry or concrete. 
c.  All retaining walls over one (1) foot in height or that support a structure must be permitted. Permits must be obtained from the building inspections division. 
d.  All retaining walls four (4) feet or greater in height must be designed by a professional engineer. 
(f)  Major recreational equipment. For the purpose of these regulations, major recreational equipment is defined as including boats and trailers, travel trailers, pick-up campers or coaches (designed to be mounted on automotive vehicles), motorized dwellings, tent trailers and the like, and cases or boxes used for transporting recreational equipment, whether occupied by such equipment or not. No such equipment shall be used for living, sleeping, home occupation or household purposes when parked or stored on a residential lot, or in any location not approved for such use. 
(g)  Front yard storage. No part of a required front yard shall be used for more than thirty (30) days for parking or storage of any vehicle, object or material; excepting, however, trailers and motor vehicles which are both currently licensed and operable. 
(h)  Environmental regulations. The following regulations are to control contamination of the air, water or the environment and to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the people: 
(1)  No machines, process or procedures shall be employed on any property in the city in which: 
a.  Emission of smoke, dust, noxious, toxic or lethal gases is detectable beyond the perimeter or the property. 
b.  Materials are stored or accumulated in such a way that they may be carried by rainwater in natural drainage channels beyond the limits of the property which are noxious, toxic, radioactive, contain oil or grease, wood or cellulose fibers, hair, feathers, plastic or have a pH factor above ten (10) or below five (5). 
c.  Vibration is discernible beyond the property line. 
d.  Noise above the ambient noise level is discernible beyond the property line. 
e.  Direct or sky-reflected glare is discernible beyond the property line. 
(2)  No swimming pool, stormwater drain, roof drain or area drain shall empty into a sanitary sewer. 
(3)  Swimming pools shall not be allowed to become stagnant or to contain any water which, due to its condition, is unhealthful. 
(i)  Landscaping: 
(1)  Purpose: These landscaping regulations provide standards and criteria for new landscaping with live plant material, and are intended to promote the value of property, enhance the general welfare, improve the physical appearance of the city, and enhance the community's ecological, environmental and aesthetic qualities. 
a.  It is the intent of this section to establish requirements for the installation and maintenance of landscaping and buffering elements and other means of site improvement on existing and newly developed property in order to enhance the community's ecological, environmental and aesthetic qualities. 
b.  It is the intent of this section to reduce the negative effects of increases in air temperatures, glare, noise, erosion, and sedimentation caused by expanses of impervious and unvegitated surfaces within the urban environment. 
c.  It is the intent of this section to preserve and improve the natural urban environment by recognizing that the use of landscaping elements can contribute to the processes of air purification; oxygen regeneration; ground water recharge; storm water runoff retardation; and the abatement of noise, glare and heat. 
d.  It is the intent of this section to safeguard and enhance property values and protect public and private investment. 
(2)  Applicability: The provisions of the landscaping regulations contained in this section shall apply in the following situations: 
a.  When an existing building is proposed for remodeling, alteration, addition, or expansion, in which the value of the proposed construction exceeds seventy-five (75) percent of the current appraised value of the existing structures, excluding the value of the land; or 
b.  When an existing building is proposed for an addition that will increase the square footage of the existing building by thirty (30) percent or greater; or 
c.  Upon all new construction; or 
d.  As a requirement of the approval of a special use permit or planned unit development. 
(3)  General criteria: 
a.  The standards contained in this section are considered minimum standards and shall apply to all zoning districts. Single-family residences and their accessory buildings shall be exempt from the requirements of this section except as provided in subsection (b) below. 
b.  All new single- and two-family residential properties shall provide a minimum of three (3) three-inch caliper trees of a species found on the approved plant list in Table 21-2. At least one (1) such tree must be located in front of the required front building line.

(12)  Landscaping credits: 
a.  Purpose. Credits for trees and shrubs are intended to encourage the enhancement of the lot through additional landscaping elements and to provide relief to parcels that are configured in such a way as to make the fifteen (15) percent landscape area requirement less burdensome. 
b.  General criteria. As an alternative to the required fifteen (15) percent total landscaped area, landscape credits may be utilized to reduce the total amount of land area dedicated for landscaping purposes. However, in no instance shall the credits reduce the total amount of landscaping on a lot to less than ten (10) percent of the total land area. Credits are allowed for existing or newly planted trees and shrubs, and only if the feature is maintained as a permanent element of the landscape plan. No credit will be given for "undesirable species", a list of suggested undesirable trees is shown in Table 21-3.

g.  Tree protection notes and details shall be included on site plans, subdivision plans or landscape plans and always included with the bid documents given to the contractor. 
(6)  Tree replacement requlirements. 
a.  Replacement tree specifications: In the event that it is necessary to remove a tree which is three (3) inches or greater via permit approval, the applicant, as a condition to issuance of a tree removal permit, shall be required to replace the trees being removed with quality trees as defined herein. A sufficient number and diameter of replacement trees shall be planted in order to equal the total diameter inches of fraction thereof trees three (3) inches or greater and slated for removal or removed in violation of this section. Replacement trees shall be a minimum of three (3) inches diameter when measured one (1) foot above the soil line a minimum of eight (8) feet in height when planted. 
Examples: 
1.  A total of eighteen (18) diameter inches removed shall be replaced with six (6) three-inch diameter trees. 
2.  A total of nineteen (19) diameter inches removed shall be replaced with seven (7) three-inch trees or five (5) three-inch trees and one (1) four-inch tree. 
b.  Procedures: Replacement trees shall be located on the subject site whenever possible. However, if this is not feasible, an applicant may initiate a proposal to plant trees off-site. This may be approved if the planting site is in reasonable proximity to the project area. The city has the authority to allow the planting to take place on another property or to allow the applicant to make a payment of the prevailing rate for installed trees per diameter inch in lieu of replanting the trees to be removed (sixty dollars ($60.00) per diameter inch initially) into a tree and landscape redevelopment fund. 
c.  Restrictions: Easements and rights-of-way: The location of replacement trees is restricted from utility easements and rights-of-way. The location shall not be in an area such that the mature canopy of the tree will interfere with overhead utility lines. No trees shall be planted within ten (10) feet of a fire hydrant. 
d.  Guarantees: All replacement trees shall be guaranteed for two (2) years from the date of the final inspection and acceptance of the project. The entire site shall have a survival rate of eighty-five (85) percent or greater. 
e.  Timing: Replacement trees shall be planted prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or project release. Optimum planting times do not always correspond to project completion. For that reason, replacement tree plantings may take place after the project is released by the city; provided, that before project release, a fiscal security is posted in the amount equal to the prevailing rate for installed trees with a one-year guarantee, plus fifteen (15) percent to cover administrative cost. 
(7)  Tree protection. A major purpose of this section is to protect all trees which are not removed and to allow approved construction to occur. The following procedures shall apply to all types of construction projects which involve development around trees. 
The following procedures are deemed appropriate in the situations noted; however, unique circumstances may allow modifications if deemed necessary by the administrative official. 
a.  Prohibited activities: The following activities shall be prohibited with the limits of the drip line of any tree which is subject to the requirements of this section. 
1.  Material storage: No materials intended for use in construction or waste materials accumulated due to excavation or demolition shall be placed within the limits of the drip line of any tree. 
2.  Equipment cleaning/liquid disposal: No equipment may be cleaned or other liquids deposited within the limits of the dripline of a tree. This would include but not be limited to, paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or other materials. 
3.  Tree attachments: No signs, wires or other attachments, other than those of a protective nature shall be attached to any tree. 
4.  Vehicular traffic: No vehicular and construction equipment traffic or parking is allowed within the limits of the dripline of trees. 
b.  Pre-construction: The ensuing procedures shall be followed prior to construction. 
1.  Tree flagging: All trees to be removed from the construction site shall be flagged with bright red vinyl tape wrapped around the main trunk at a height of four feet (4) or more such that the tape is visible to workers on foot or driving equipment. 
2.  Protective fencing: All trees shall have protective fencing located at the tree's drip line. The protective fencing may be comprised of snow fencing, orange vinyl construction fencing, chain link fence or other similar fencing with a four-foot (4) approximate height. The protective fencing may be located within the drip line of the specimen tree for approved construction only. The fencing shall follow the delineation of the approved construction. 
3.  Bark protection: In situations where a tree remains in the immediate areas of intended construction, the tree shall be protected by enclosing the entire circumference of the tree's trunk with lumber encircled with wire or other means that does not damage the tree. 
4.  Construction pruning: In a case where a low hanging limb may be broken during the course of construction, the obtrusive limb may be cut. The limb shall be cut either flush to the trunk on or at the next joint of the limb. The wound shall then be sealed with pruning paint. In no instance shall pruning involve a portion of the trunk or thirty (30) percent of the entire canopy without the administrative official's prior approval. 
c.  Improvement within the critical root zone of a tree: Design constraints often dictate that trees slated for preservation have some encroachment on their critical root zone. The following is the minimum design criteria which is allowed within the critical root zone of a tree. Development exceeding the criteria would put the tree at risk and therefore no longer be considered a preserved tree. In such a case replacement trees shall also be required. 
1.  Grade changes: In the event that grade changes must be made around a tree or group of trees, the following should be implemented in order to maintain oxygen and water exchange within the tree's critical root zone. 
i.  Minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the critical root zone must be preserved at natural grade with natural ground cover or landscaping for the tree to be considered a preserved tree. 
ii.  No cut or fill greater than two (2) inches shall be located closer to the tree trunk than one-half (1/2) of the radius of the critical root zone radius distance. 
iii.  Increase grade: Provide an aeration system just outside the tree's drip line. A dry well located a minimum of one-half (1/2) of the radius of the critical root zone. 
iv.  Decrease grade: Provide retaining walls outside the dripline to mitigate cuts. 
2.  Boring of utilities: May be permitted under protected trees in certain circumstances. The minimum length of the bore shall be the width of the tree's canopy and shall be a minimum depth of forty-eight (48) inches. 
3.  Trenching: Irrigation systems shall be designed to avoid trenching across the critical root zone of any tree. 
4.  Paving: A maximum of twenty-five (25) percent of the critical root zone of a tree may be covered with impervious paving. The pavement and the cut and fill for the pavement is to not exceed one-half (1/2) of the critical root zone radius distance. 
d.  Notes required as a part of all construction plans: 
1.  All trees shown on this plan to be preserved shall be protected during construction with temporary fencing. Tree protection fences shall be installed prior to the commencement of any site preparation work (clearing, grubbing or grading). 
2.  Fences shall completely surround the tree or clusters of trees. The fence shall be located at the outermost limits of the tree branches or dripline. The fence will be maintained throughout the construction project in order to prevent the following: 
i.  Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from vehicular traffic or storage of equipment or materials. 
ii.  Critical root zone disturbances due to grade changes greater than two (2) inches cut or fill, or boring which was not authorized by the city. 
iii.  Wounds, to the trunk, limbs or exposed roots by mechanical equipment. 
iv.  Other activities detrimental to trees such as chemical storage, cement trunk cleaning, and fires. 
3.  In cases of area constraints where the protective fence is closer to the trunk than four (4) feet, the trunk must be protected with strapped-on planking to a height of eight (8) feet or to the limits of the lower branching. 
4.  All grading within critical root zones of specimen trees shall be performed by hand or small equipment to minimize damage. Prior to grading, relocate the protective fencing to two (2) feet behind the grade change area. 
5.  Trees most heavily impacted by construction activities should be watered deeply once a week during periods of hot and dry weather. Tree crowns should be sprayed with water periodically to reduce dust accumulation on the leaves. 
6.  Trenching for landscape irrigation shall be located as far from the existing trunks as possible. 
7.  Pruning to provide clearance for structures, vehicular traffic and equipment shall take place before construction begins. 
(8)  Violations. Any person violating or failing to comply with any provision or requirement of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall without exception, be fined the maximum amount provided in this chapter. 
a.  A monetary penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per diameter inch of the tree(s) removed or damaged shall be assessed and paid to the City of Hurst. 
b.  A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which each separate violation or failure to comply occurs or continues to occur and shall be punishable as such.

Sec. 27-23. - Application of district regulations. 
(a)  Uniformity. The regulations set by this chapter for each district shall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, except as hereinafter provided. 
(b)  Conformity with regulations required. No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in conformity with all the regulations specified in this section for the district in which it is located. This shall be deemed to include only the portion of the building, structure or land which is actually newly occupied, newly used, erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered after the effective date of this chapter. 
(1)  Lot area deficiency: If a lot established by a plat approved by the city council contains less area than is required by current ordinances, such deficiency shall not prevent the use of such lot, subject to other applicable regulations. 
(2)  Width deficiency, setback lines: In previously platted subdivisions, the building need not be set back from the property line any further than a majority of principal buildings previously constructed in the subdivision except as necessary to achieve a sixty-foot width at the front building line. 
(3)  Lots reduced by eminent domain: If the area of a legally platted lot meeting the current area minimums for lots in the same zoning districts is reduced by no more than fifteen (15) percent by eminent domain or conveyance to an entity capable of acquiring such property by eminent domain, such lot shall not be deemed to be nonconforming, and any required landscaping, parking, and open space contained within the area taken shall continue to be counted against the total required for existing or proposed development. 
(4)  Unplatted property: If property currently under separate ownership from adjacent property does not meet present minimum area or width requirements such deficiency shall not prevent utilization of the property if a plat of the property is approved by the city council. 
(c)  Grades, open spaces, off-street parking or loading spaces. No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space required about or in connection with any building or use for the purpose of complying with this chapter, shall be included as part of a yard, open space or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other building or use. 
(d)  Newly annexed territory: 
(1)  All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the city shall automatically be classed as lying and being in district R-1 until such classification shall have been changed by an amendment to the zoning ordinance as provided by law. 
(2)  No person shall erect, excavate, construct or proceed or continue with the erection or construction of any building or structure or add to, enlarge, move, improve, alter, repair, convert or demolish any building or structure or cause the same to be done in any area of the city or in any newly annexed territory to the city without first applying for and obtaining a building permit therefor from the enforcing officer as may be required in applicable city ordinances. 
(e)  Completion of buildings. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction or use of a building for which a currently valid building permit has been obtained at the time of passage of this chapter, as long as the entire building is completed within one (1) year from the effective date of this chapter. The zoning board of adjustment, upon application, may grant one (1) extension of the time of completion of not more than one (1) year upon a showing of reasonable progress of construction. Any building permit in effect at the passage of this chapter shall become void if construction is not begun within one hundred twenty (120) days thereof. 
(f)  Occupancy of dwelling units. No dwelling unit shall be occupied except by a family, as the term is defined in this chapter. 
(g)  Uses permitted only in districts when specifically allowed. No use is permitted in any district unless it is specifically allowed by the regulations governing such district. Any use not named in any district is prohibited from the entire city. A use named in any district and not named in any other district is allowed only in the district where it is named. Where district regulations specifically allow permitted uses from another district, such shall allow only those uses appearing under the permitted uses section of such other district, and shall not allow planned development uses or conditional uses. 
(h)  Alcoholic beverage sales. The terms "retail sales," "cafes," "restaurants," "cafeterias," "drive-through eating establishment," and "drive-in eating establishment" and "convenience food store" do not include the right to sell alcoholic beverages unless the general condition of the zoning district permits such sale. 
(i)  Community homes for disabled persons. Community homes for disabled persons will be allowed in any district zoned as residential. 
(j)  Temporary permits. Notwithstanding the requirements for districts and for uniformity of regulations, the city manager or his designee may, after a local disaster, such as a tornado, hail storm, flooding, explosion or conflagration, issue a temporary permit authorizing use of property not otherwise allowed by this Chapter 27, for a term of up to sixty (60) days after such local disaster if, in his opinion, such use will assist Hurst residents in coping with such disaster. Such permit shall not create any rights to a nonconforming use and may be conditioned as the city manager or his designee shall see fit. 
(Code 1965, Ch. 27, §§ 21.1-21.8; Ord. No. 1164, § 1, 1-27-87; Ord. No. 1228, § 3, 4-26-88; Ord. No. 1365, § 2, 6-9-92; Ord. No. 1498, § 1, 7-25-95) 
Sec. 27-24. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Defined. The term "nonconforming" shall be deemed to mean that a use or structure was lawful at the time it was begun, but could not presently be so begun, used or constructed under current ordinances and zoning. 
(b)  Continuation. The lawful use of any building, structure, sign or land existing at the time such property was more restrictively zoned may be continued except as this chapter may require abatement within a given period of time; provided, however, the right to continue such nonconforming uses shall be subject to regulations prohibiting nuisances and shall be terminated when such use constitutes a nuisance. Such nonconforming uses shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as the zoning board of adjustment may require to protect adjacent property and shall be subject to the specific nonconforming use regulations contained in this section. 
(c)  Removal or conversion of uses in R zones. In any of the R single or multiple-family residential zones, buildings which are legally used for uses not allowed in such district by this chapter at the time of its passage or which may be prohibited by future amendments shall be removed or converted and their premises thereafter devoted to uses permitted in the district within five (5) years of the date hereof, or within the period required by any previous ordinance also requiring abatement of such nonconforming use, whichever is less, or if such uses are hereafter made nonconforming by amendments to districts or to the regulations thereof, within five (5) years of the date such use becomes nonconforming; provided, however, if the fair market value of the buildings as considered separate from the land, as used for commercial purposes, is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) above the value of such buildings used for conforming uses, all as existed at the time the use was first required by this or any previous ordinance requiring abatement, then the zoning board of adjustment may grant an extension for amortization purposes not to exceed an additional twenty (20) years. 
(d)  Uses not requiring business building, etc., in R zones. Uses of land not requiring a business building, including outside storage, outside sales, trailer parks and courts and the like, located in any R single or multiple-family zoning district shall cease and desist within two (2) years of the date of this section or within the period required by any previous ordinance also requiring abatement, whichever is less, or, if such uses are hereafter made nonconforming by amendments to districts or to the regulations thereof, within two (2) years of the date such use becomes nonconforming. The shorter period provided for nonconforming uses without buildings is based on the lack of any capital investment in improvements as distinguished from land value. If there are improvements of some type of worth more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) more for the existing nonconforming use than for any conforming use, the zoning board of adjustment may grant an extension of time for amortization purposes not to exceed an additional twenty (20) years. 
(e)  Damage to signs. Nonconforming signs may be maintained so long as no changes are made in such sign and so long as they are kept in good repair. Should a sign be destroyed or damaged to the extent of fifty (50) percent or more of its replacement cost, including supports thereof, such sign shall not be repaired or reconstructed but shall be removed or made to conform to this section. All signs, whether conforming or nonconforming, shall be kept in good repair. Good repair shall mean that all sign faces are present, legible and unbroken; that supports are structurally and mechanically sound; and that the entire installation is electrically safe. If a sign shall be found to be in other than good repair, the property owner or his agent in charge of the premises where such sign is located shall be notified of defects and shall have thirty (30) days to bring the sign into compliance. If such sign is not repaired within such time, the sign shall be removed and the costs collected from the owner of the property from which such defective sign is removed. 
(f)  Accidental damage to building. If a building occupied by nonconforming uses is destroyed by fire or the elements, it may not be reconstructed or rebuilt except to conform with provisions herein. In the case of partial destruction by fire or other causes not exceeding fifty (50) percent of its current replacement value, the enforcing officer shall issue a permit for reconstruction. If greater than fifty (50) percent and less than total, the board may grant a permit for repair but not for enlargement of the building. 
(g)  Substandard structure. The right to operate and maintain any nonconforming structure shall terminate and shall cease to exist whenever the nonconforming structure becomes substandard under any applicable ordinance of the city and the cost of placing such structure in lawful compliance with the applicable ordinance exceeds fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost of such structure on the date that the enforcing officer determines that such structure is substandard. 
(h)  Determination of replacement cost. In determining the replacement cost of any nonconforming structure, there shall not be included therein the cost of land or any factors other than the nonconforming structure itself, including foundation. 
(i)  Repairs and alterations. Repairs and alterations may be made to an undamaged nonconforming building or structure; provided, however, no structural alterations shall be made except those required by law or ordinance, unless the building is changed to a conforming use; and provided that no additional dwelling units shall be added where the nonconforming use results from there being more dwelling units on the lot than is permissible in the district in which the building is located. No enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use shall take place except as the zoning board of adjustment may grant, as a special exception, an application to extend or enlarge a building occupied by a nonconforming use or that portion of the lot occupied by such use, provided such grant does not serve to prevent the return of such property to a conforming use. 
(j)  Continuance of nonconforming use. Except as this section may otherwise require, any nonconforming use may be continued in operation on the same land area and on the same floor area in a structure or structures which were occupied by the nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of any amendment by which the use became nonconforming, but such land area or floor area shall not be increased. 
(k)  Registration of nonconforming use. It shall be the right of the joint tenants and owners of a nonconforming use to register the same by securing a certificate of occupancy as herein provided. 
(l)  Changing a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use may be changed to a use conforming with the regulations established in this chapter for the district in which the nonconforming use is located; provided, however, that a nonconforming use so changed shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
(m)  Abandonment. A nonconforming use of any building or structure which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be returned to any nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned when: 
(1)  It has been replaced with a conforming use; 
(2)  Such building or structure is or hereafter becomes vacant and remains unoccupied or out of use for a continuous period of six (6) months, or the special equipment and furnishings peculiar to the nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced within such six-month period; or 
(3)  The intention of the owner to permanently discontinue the use is apparent.

Board members may be appointed to succeed themselves. 
(c)  Vacancies. Vacancies shall be filled for unexpired terms; no member shall be appointed for a term in excess of two (2) years. A vacancy in a term of office shall occur whenever the council finds that a member has resigned or has not maintained the qualifications required for appointment. 
(d)  Organization. The board shall elect a chairman from among its members to preside at meetings. Such chairman, or in his absence an acting chairman elected from among the members, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses.

Newly appointed members shall be installed at the first regular meeting after their appointment. 
(e)  Meetings and quorum. Four (4) members of the board shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of business. The members of the board shall regularly attend meetings and public hearings of the board and shall serve without compensation, except for reimbursement for authorized expenses attendant to the performance of their duties. All meetings shall be open to the public. Minutes shall be kept showing the vote of each member on each question or the absence or failure of each member to vote. Such minutes shall be a public record and shall be retained for at least five (5) years. 
(f)  Duties and powers. The board of adjustment shall have the powers and exercise the duties of a board in accordance with Article 1011g, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas. Board members are representatives of the city and shall have the right to inspect premises where required in the discharge of their responsibilities under the laws of the state and the ordinances of this city. The board's jurisdiction shall extend to and include the hearing and deciding of the following types of appeals and applications and to that end shall have the necessary authority to ensure continuing compliance with its decision: 
(1)  Interpretation: To render an interpretation of the zoning regulations or the manner of their application where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement or determination made by the enforcing officer in the administration of such provisions. In reaching its decision, the board shall establish firm guidelines for future administrative actions on like manners; 
(2)  Special exception: To decide upon those applications for a special exception to use or develop property when the same is authorized under these regulations subject to board approval; 
(3)  Variance: To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest. Such variances shall not be authorized unless the board makes an affirmative finding to all the following requirements: 
a.  That literal enforcement of the controls will create an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty in the development of the affected property; 
b.  That the situation causing the hardship or difficulty is neither self-imposed nor generally affecting all or most properties in the same zoning district; 
c.  That the relief sought will not injure the permitted use of adjacent conforming property; 
d.  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the spirit and purposes of these regulations. 
(g)  Interpretation request; variance appeal. A request for interpretation of regulations or an appeal for variance from development controls may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by a decision of the enforcing officer. Such appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days after the decision has been rendered by filing with the enforcing officer a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The enforcing officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(h)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings of the action appealed from, unless the enforcing officer, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him, certifies to the board that by reason of facts stated in his certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on application on notice to the enforcing officer and on due cause shown. 
(i)  Special exception application. An application for a special exception to use or develop property as specifically authorized in district use regulations or in this section may be filed by any person owning the affected property, or by any tenant upon written authorization of the owner. Such application shall be filed with the enforcing officer. 
(j)  Form of appeal or application. The appeal or application shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the board may require under its rules of procedure. It shall be accompanied by the required fee. An incomplete appeal or application shall be deemed only to give notice of intent to appeal or apply to the board and shall not be reviewed or scheduled for hearings until brought to completion. 
(k)  Notice of hearing. Official written notice of public hearing on every application for a variance or special exception or for an interpretation of regulations applying solely to an individual property shall be sent to all owners of property, or the person rendering the same for taxes, affected by such application, located within two hundred (200) feet of any property affected thereby, excluding any intervening public street, at least ten (10) days before such hearing is held. Such notice shall be served by using the last known address as listed on the city tax roll and depositing the notice, postage paid, in the United States mail. Notice of hearings shall also be given by causing publication of the time and place of such hearing in the official newspaper at least ten (10) days prior thereto, together with a brief description of the subject matter of the hearing. 
(l)  Posting. The city manager or his designee shall erect at least one (1) sign upon the property on which an application for action by the zoning board of adjustment is pending, which sign shall have a total area of at least four (4) square feet. Such sign or signs shall, if possible, be located adjacent to streets. Such sign shall be erected on or before the date of mailing of notice to property owners and shall be removed immediately after final action by the zoning board of adjustment or upon withdrawal of the request by the applicant, whichever comes first. The sign shall state that the property posted is under consideration by the city for a zoning request and shall contain the telephone number and office to contact in city hall for specific information about the scheduled hearing date and the requested zoning action. The erection or continued maintenance of the sign shall not be deemed a condition precedent to the holding of any public hearing or of the action by the zoning board of adjustment. 
(m)  Hearing: 
(1)  Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by attorney or agent. Evidence supporting the grant or denial of an appeal shall be submitted only through the enforcing officer or to the board in public meeting. 
(2)  Any appeal or application may be withdrawn upon written notice to the enforcing officer, but no appeal shall be withdrawn after posting of hearing notice and prior to board action thereon without formal consent of the board. 
(3)  The board shall make its decision on any application within forty-five (45) days from the time the initial hearing is held or the application will be deemed to have been denied. 
(n)  Decision and voting: 
(1)  Every decision of the board shall be based upon findings of fact and every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of proceedings. The enumerated conditions required to exist on any matter upon which the board is authorized to pass under these regulations shall be construed as limitations, on the power of the board to act. 
(2)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to empower the board to change the terms of these regulations, or to effect changes in the zoning districts. The powers of the board shall be so applied that the terms of these regulations will be strictly enforced. 
(3)  In exercising its powers, the board of adjustment, in conformity with the provisions of Articles 1011a through 1011j of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, may modify in whole or in part any order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. 
(4)  The concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse, on appeal, any order, requirement, decision or determination of the enforcing officer, or to approve any application upon which it is required to pass under these regulations or to effect any variance in such regulations. 
a.  A member shall disqualify himself from voting whenever he has a personal or monetary interest in the property under appeal, or will be directly affected by the decision of the board. 
b.  A member may disqualify himself from voting whenever any applicant, or his agent, has sought to influence the member's vote on the appeal, other than in the public hearing. 
(o)  Approval of request: 
(1)  In approving any request, the board may designate such conditions including time limits, if appropriate, in connection therewith in order to secure substantially the objectives of the regulation or provision to which variance is granted and provide adequately for the maintenance of the integrity and character of the zone in which such permit is granted. 
(2)  When necessary, the board may require guarantees, in such form as it deems proper, to insure that conditions designated in connection therewith are being or will be complied with. 
(3)  Upon approval of an application for special exception or of a variance appeal, the applicant shall apply for occupancy or construction permits within sixty (60) days after the board's decision, unless a greater time is requested in the application and is authorized by the board. Any approval may be granted one (1) emergency extension of sixty (60) days on written request filed with the board before expiration of the original approval. Failure of the applicant to apply for occupancy of construction permits within the authorized time period shall void the right to secure such permits except upon the filing of a new application or appeal. 
(p)  Denial of request. No application for variance or special exception shall be considered within six (6) months of denial of a request for a variance or special exception on the same property. 
(q)  Appeal of board action. Any person or persons, jointly or separately, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the city aggrieved by any decision of the zoning board of adjustment may present to the appropriate court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of such illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within ten (10) days after the filing of the decision complained of in the offices of the board and not thereafter. 
(r)  Authorized special exceptions. Unless specifically permitted as a named use or as a categorized use in zoning district, the following special exceptions may be permitted in any district except where otherwise limited in this chapter, subject to full and complete compliance with any and all conditions enumerated together with such other conditions as the board may impose:

In determining whether this exception shall be granted, the board shall hear evidence on whether signing on the face of the building or above a canopy would be practicable, and on what other signs are in the area. This exception shall not be granted if effective signing is otherwise possible. No consideration shall be given to the value of signs in determining whether this exception shall be granted. 
(13)  Handicapped occupations:

Sec. 27-26. - Amendments. 
(a)  Generally. The zoning regulations, restrictions and boundaries may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified or repealed. Such amendments, supplements, changes, modification or repeal shall be deemed to amend, supplement, change, modify or repeal the comprehensive plan of the city and shall become a part of such comprehensive plan. The planning and zoning commission and its composition and duties are established by Article IV of Chapter 2 of this Code. 
(b)  Amendment initiation. An amendment to this chapter may be initiated by: 
(1)  The city council on its own motion; 
(2)  The planning and zoning commission; or 
(3)  A request by the owner or agent of the owner of the property to be changed. 
(c)  Procedure. All requests for amendments to zoning district boundaries shall be submitted, together with required fees, to the enforcing officer, who shall cease notices to be sent and place the petition on the planning and zoning commission agenda. The city council may not enact any proposed amendment until the planning and zoning commission makes its final report to the city council. The city council may refer proposed amendments to the planning and zoning commission for recommendation. Requests for changes in zoning districts shall include the proposed designation or designations for the area concerned. Alternative proposals may be made. 
(d)  Public hearing and notice. Prior to making its report to the city council, the planning and zoning commission shall hold at least one (1) public hearing thereon. Written notice of all public hearings on proposed changes in district boundaries shall be sent not less than ten (10) days before such hearing is held to all owners of property who have rendered their property for city taxes, which is located within the area proposed to be changed, within two hundred (200) feet of such property, or within two hundred (200) feet of any other adjacent property under the same ownership as the tract to be rezoned. Measurements shall be taken exclusive of public streets. Such notice may be served by using the last known address as listed on the city tax roll and depositing the notice, postage paid, in the United States mail. No notice of hearings before the planning and zoning commission on proposed changes in zoning regulations need be given, except as may be required by open meeting laws. 
(e)  Commission report. The planning and zoning commission, after the public hearing is closed, shall vote on its recommendations on the proposed change to be sent in a report to the city council. Such report may recommend for or against such proposed change and may, but need not, include reasons for such decision. The commission may defer its report for not more than sixty (60) days until it has had opportunity to consider other proposed changes which may have a direct bearing thereon. If the commission fails to finally report after sixty (60) days, it should be deemed to have recommended negatively to the proposal. 
(f)  Forwarding final report. Every proposal receiving a final report by the commission shall be forwarded to the council for setting and holding of public hearing thereon. No change, however, shall become effective until after the adoption of an ordinance for the same and its publication as required by law. 
(g)  Withdrawal. Any proposal or application may be withdrawn by the proponent after the commission makes its final report, and such proposal or application shall not be subject to the provision hereof that a period of time must pass before a new application is considered. If such proposal is withdrawn, the council will not consider it. 
(h)  Sign posting. The city manager or his designee shall erect at least one (1) sign on the property proposed to be rezoned, which sign shall have the total area of at least four (4) square feet. Such sign or signs shall, if possible, be located adjacent to streets. Such sign shall be erected on or before the first date of the first notice to property owners and shall be removed immediately after final action by the city council, or upon a withdrawal of the request by the applicant, whichever comes first. The sign shall state that the property posted is under consideration by the city for a zoning request and shall contain the telephone number and office to contact in city hall for specific information about the scheduled hearing date and the requested zoning action. The erection or continued maintenance of the sign shall not be deemed a condition precedent to the granting of any zone change or the holding of any public hearing. 
(i)  Council hearing and notice. The city council may from time to time amend, supplement or change by ordinance the boundaries of the districts or the regulations established in this chapter. A public hearing on such amendment, supplement or change shall be held by the council. Notice of council hearing shall be given by publication one (1) time in the official paper of the city, stating the time and place of such hearing, which time shall not be earlier than fifteen (15) days from the date of publication. No such amendment, supplement or change shall be considered unless and until the commission makes its final report thereon. Publication of such change shall be accomplished by publishing the descriptive caption and penalty clause of the ordinance amending the comprehensive plan to incorporate the change. 
(j)  Denial of request for rezoning; application not to be considered for another six months. No application for rezoning shall be considered within six (6) months of denial of a request for the same classification on the same property. 
(k)  Protest against change. In case of a written protest against such change signed by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more either of the land included in such proposed change, or of the lots or land immediately adjoining the same and extending two hundred (200) feet therefrom, such amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the city council present and qualified to vote (five-sixths, four-fifths, three-fourths). In computing the percentage of land area, the area of streets and alleys shall be included in the computation. 
(l)  Council action on application. The proponent of any zone change shall satisfy the city council that either the general welfare of all the city affected by the area to be changed will be enhanced, or that the property is unusable for the purposes allowed under existing zoning. If such is proved to the council's satisfaction, it may grant the requested zone change; or it may change the zone's designation of a portion of such property; or it may initiate a request to consider changing all or a portion of such property to a district other than that requested and of a different character.

Sec. 27-28. - Communication towers. 
(a)  Purpose. These regulations are intended to provide for the appropriate location and development of communication towers and antennas to serve the residents and businesses of the City of Hurst; 
(1)  Minimize any adverse visual impact of towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscaping and screening; 
(2)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures; 
(3)  Maximize use of any new or existing communication towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
(4)  Maximize and encourage use of alternative tower structures as primary options rather than construction of additional single-use towers. 
(b)  Applicability. The regulations contained in this section shall be applicable to all new towers or antennas in the City of Hurst except as provided below: 
(1)  Amateur radio station operators/receive only antennas. This section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under forty-five (45) feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas. 
(2)  Pre-existing towers or antennas. Pre-existing towers and pre-existing antennas shall not be required to meet the requirements of this section, other than those required by chapter 23.5. 
(3)  All municipal/public domain property and city employees or authorized contractors. 
(c)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
    Administrative official: The City of Hurst City Manager or designee. 
    Alternative tower structure: Manmade structures such as clock towers, bell towers, church steeples, light poles, electrical transmission towers and similar alternative design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas and towers. 
    Antenna: Any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves, excluding satellite dish antennas. 
    FAA: The Federal Aviation Administration. 
    FCC: The Federal Communications Commission. 
    Height: When referring to a tower, or other structure means the distance measured vertically from the finished grade to the highest point on the tower, antenna or structure.

    Telecommunications or communications: The transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of audio and/or visual information of the user's choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. 
    Tower or structure: A structure constructed as a freestanding structure or in association with a building, other permanent structure or equipment, on which is located one (1) or more antennas intended for transmitting or receiving television, AM/FM radio, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, or similar forms of electronic communication. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common carrier towers, and cellular telephone towers. A tower does not include a receive-only home television antenna, or any satellite dish antenna two (2) meters or less in diameter. 
    Tower, guyed: Any telecommunications tower supported in whole or part by cables anchored to the ground. 
    Tower, monopole: A self-supporting telecommunications tower which consists of a single vertical pole fixed into the ground and/or attached to a foundation. 
(d)  Building permit required. No communications tower or antenna shall be constructed or erected without first obtaining a building permit. 
    Furthermore, as specified in this section, no communications tower shall be constructed except with approval of a planned development site plan by the Hurst Planning and Zoning Commission and the Hurst City Council. The application procedures contained in this section relating to the application, processing, and determination of whether to grant a site plan approval as specified herein, are in addition to any other provisions and requirements contained in other sections of the City of Hurst Zoning Ordinance. 
(1)  Communication towers shall be permitted in nonresidential districts. 
(2)  Communication towers are permitted on existing nonresidential buildings or on alternative structures with approval of a building permit, but without obtaining a site plan approval if the nonresidential building or alternative tower structure exceeds fifty (50) feet in height and the antenna will add no more than twenty (20) feet total to the height of the existing building or structure. 
(3)  All telecommunication facilities requiring rezoning or site plan approval including towers and related equipment buildings shall be located on a platted lot. 
(4)  The effects of radio frequency emissions on persons or the environment shall not be considered in a proceeding involving an application for a permit of a communications tower. 
(5)  No telecommunications tower may be constructed if there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower, building structure, or alternative technology within the service area that the new tower is to serve. 
(e)  Application procedures for constructing a communications tower. Application for a building permit or a site plan approval to construct a communications tower must contain the following information and will not be considered until all information is complete: 
(1)  An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within the city or within one (1) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, design, and height of each tower. The administrative official may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or variances under this section or with other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the city; provided, however, that the administrative official is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that the sites are available or suitable. 
(2)  A site plan drawn to scale clearly indicating the location, height, and design of the proposed tower, equipment cabinets, transmission buildings and other accessory uses, access, parking, fences, and masonry screening walls. 
(3)  A legal description of the site. 
(4)  The separation distance from other towers within a one-mile radius of the proposed tower site. 
(5)  A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of service, personnel needs, equipment needs, and traffic, noise or safety impacts of the maintenance. 
(6)  A report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the State of Texas, documenting the following: 
a.  Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic, and other pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross-section of the tower structure shall be included. 
b.  Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including the number and types of antennas which can be accommodated. 
c.  Evidence of the structural integrity of the tower structure. 
d.  Failure characteristics of the tower and evidence that site and setbacks are of adequate size to contain a failure within the site. 
e.  Certification that the tower will meet all applicable FCC, FAA and local building codes. 
(7)  A letter of intent from the landowner agreeing to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess land on the tower site, if structurally and technically possible. 
(8)  The administrative official shall maintain and provide, on request, records of response from each owner. Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described below, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed. 
(9)  Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The city council may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. 
(10)  Any other information which may be requested by the administrative official to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed tower or antenna. 
(f)  Documentation of need of communications tower. No new communications tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the administrative official or, when applicable, the city council, that no existing tower, building, structure, or alternative technology that does not require the use of a tower can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. The applicant shall submit information related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology which will demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Such information may consist of any of the following: 
(1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area which meets the applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
(3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
(4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. 
(6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
(7)  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(8)  If the administrative official is not satisfied that the applicant has provided adequate documentation of need for the proposed site, the application shall be automatically scheduled for the next available public hearing by the city council for consideration. 
(g)  General requirements. 
(1)  No advertising sign shall be allowed on a communications tower. 
(2)  No signs or illumination shall be allowed on a communications tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction, in which case the administrative official may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
(3)  No equipment cabinet or building shall be greater than eight (8) feet in height and one hundred (100) square feet in gross floor area. All buildings or cabinets shall be constructed of brick or solid concrete with exposed aggregate exterior surfaces, except for those with less than twenty-five (25) square feet of gross floor area. 
(4)  Equipment buildings shall not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. 
(5)  All communication towers as well as guys and guy anchors shall be located with in buildable area of the lot not within the front, rear, or side yard setbacks. 
(h)  Spacing and development requirements. 
(1)  Maximum height and setback: No communications tower shall exceed one hundred thirty (130) feet in height. Every communications tower shall be set back from all residential structures at a ratio of two (2) feet of setback for each one (1) foot of tower height. 
(2)  Spacing: All communications towers constructed shall conform to the minimum tower separation requirements listed in Table 1. An antenna mounted on an existing communications tower or on an alternative tower structure shall be exempt from these minimum separation distances. 
Table 1 
SEPARATION DISTANCE Existing Tower 
Height Proposed Tower Height <65 ft. 65-130 ft. <65 ft. 1000 ft. 1250 ft. 65-130 ft. 1250 ft. 1500 ft.  
(3)  Maximum number of towers: No more than one (1) communications tower shall be allowed on a lot or parcel, provided, however, that additional towers may be approved on the lot with a site plan approval. 
(i)  Visual impacts. Communications towers and any equipment building and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
(1)  All towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
(2)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(3)  All towers shall be of monopole construction unless the city council approves an alternate design. 
(4)  Building finish: The exterior of all equipment buildings and/or metal equipment cabinets must have a neutral aggregate finish or be painted to reflect the color and character of adjoining structures or blend with adjacent landscaping and other surroundings. 
(5)  Masonry screening walls: All free standing communication towers shall be screened by a masonry wall not less than six (6) feet in height and/or must screen all related equipment. The city council may require additional masonry screening walls to mitigate an adverse condition or may waive such masonry screening wall requirement when considering a request for a site plan approval. 
(j)  Shared use. All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional users technically practicable. 
(1)  To encourage shared use of towers, no site plan approval shall be required for the addition of antenna(s) to an existing tower so long as the height of the tower or structure on which the antenna is placed is not increased and the requirements of this section are met. 
(2)  Any site plan approval which is granted for a new communications tower is specifically subject to the condition that the tower owner abide by the following provisions relating to shared use, regardless of whether or not the ordinance granting the permit contains such conditions: 
a.  The tower owner shall respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential shared use applicant; 
b.  The tower owner shall negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; 
c.  The tower owner shall allow shared use where the third party seeking the use agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference. 
d.  The willful failure of an owner whose tower was approved under this chapter to comply with the requirements of this chapter shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by the owner for a building permit for the approved tower, for revoking the building permit granted for the tower, and for refusing to approve a new building permit for any new tower or antenna. 
(k)  Removal of unsafe or non-compliant antennas and towers. All towers and antennas shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of the towers. If upon inspection by the administrative official the tower is determined not to comply with the code standards or constitutes a danger to persons or property and the tower is not made safe or removed within sixty (60) days of notification from the city notifying the landowner and the owner of the unsafe tower or antenna, the city may remove the tower or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of the removal. 
(l)  Abandoned towers. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for any continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall remove the tower or antenna within ninety (90) days after notification from the city to remove the tower or antenna. 
(1)  If the tower or antenna is not removed within the notification time period, the city may remove the tower or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of the removal. 
(2)  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use the abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this chapter as if the tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna. 
(m)  Pre-existing towers and nonconforming uses. All communication towers operative prior to the effective date of this section, shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a nonconforming use and shall be treated as a nonconforming use in accordance with the zoning regulations. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on the existing towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on an existing communication tower shall comply with the requirements of this section.
