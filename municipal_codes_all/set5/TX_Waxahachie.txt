PREFACE 
    This Code is a republication of the 1973 Code of Ordinances, as reproduced in 1985. Ordinances were added in this republication through Ordinance No. 2424, adopted August 20, 2007. This republication was prepared by Linda Davis, Editor, with the able assistance of the MCC staff. State law reference footnotes have been updated and new indexes have been prepared. 
    The page numbering system used in this republication is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

    The preface as it appears in the 2003 Code of Ordinances is reprinted herein as follows: 
    This Code was originally published in 1973 and subsequently reproduced in 1985 and constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the City Council and is the first such codification for the City of Waxahachie. Included herein, for the convenience of the user, is the City's Charter, as amended. 
    As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, this Code supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. The Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included herein. For more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
Organization of Code Provisions 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to correlative charter provisions and relevant state laws have been included. Also, the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 20 is 20-14. Under this system, the section is identified with its chapter number and, at the same time, new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number, e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12 1/2. A chapter appearing between Chapters 12 and 12 1/2 would be designated as Chapter 12 1/4, and so on. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Looseleaf Supplement Service 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part hereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend entirely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Preparation of the Index 
    The general Index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care, together with the Charter Index. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the Index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Acknowledgments

ARTICLE I. - THE CITY OF WAXAHACHIE 

Section 1.01. - Corporate name. 
    The inhabitants of the City of Waxahachie, Texas, residing within the boundaries now or hereafter legally designated, are and shall continue to be a body politic and corporate by and under the name of the City of Waxahachie, with all the rights, powers, privileges and immunities hereafter defined and stated and/or designated by the statutes of the State of Texas. 
Section 1.02. - Powers of the city. 
    The city shall have all powers possible for a city to have under the constitution and statutes of the State of Texas as fully and completely as though they were specifically enumerated in this charter, including, but not exclusively, all powers granted to home rule cities under the provisions of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas. The powers of the city under this charter shall be construed liberally in favor of the city, and the specific mention of particular powers in the charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general power stated in this article. 
Section 1.03. - Intergovernmental relations. 
    The city may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its functions and may participate in the financing thereof, jointly or in cooperation, with any one or more legally constituted politic bodies or agencies thereof. 
Section 1.04. - Boundaries. 
    The boundaries of the City of Waxahachie shall be the same as have heretofore been established and as they existed on January 1 of 1971, which boundaries are more fully set out and described by metes and bounds in a document entitled "Boundaries of the Corporate Limits of the City of Waxahachie, Ellis County, Texas," which is filed in the city hall of the City of Waxahachie, and of record in the minutes of the city council of the City of Waxahachie. 
Section 1.05. - Extension of boundaries. 
    The boundaries of the City of Waxahachie may be enlarged and extended by the annexation of additional territory, irrespective of size and configuration except as same may be regulated and limited by article 970a of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, in any of the methods now authorized or hereinafter to be authorized by law, with or without the consent of the inhabitants of said additional territory, or if uninhabited, with or without the consent of the owners of said additional territory. Upon completion by any one of the procedures hereinabove provided, the territory so annexed shall become a part of the city, and said land and its residents and future residents shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of other citizens of the city and shall be bound by the acts, ordinances, resolutions and regulations of the city. 
Section 1.06. - Contraction of boundaries. 
    Whenever there exists within the corporate limits of the City of Waxahachie any territory not suitable or necessary for city purposes, the city council may, upon a petition signed by a majority of the qualified voters residing in such territory if the same be inhabited, or without any such petition if the same be uninhabited, by ordinance duly passed, discontinue said territory as a part of said city; said petition and ordinance shall specify accurately the metes and bounds of the territory sought to be eliminated from the city and shall contain a plat designating such territory so that the same can be definitely ascertained; and when said ordinance has been duly passed the same shall be entered upon the minutes and records of said city, and from and after the entry of such ordinance said territory shall cease to be a part of said city, but said territory shall still be liable for its pro rata share of any debts incurred while said area was a part of said city, and the city shall continue to levy, assess and collect taxes on the property within said territory to pay the indebtedness incurred while said area was a part of the city as though the same had not been excluded from the boundaries of the city.

Each voter shall be entitled to vote for as many candidates for city council as there are members to be elected to the council. The members of the city council shall hold their office for a term of two years and until their successors have been elected and qualified. The councilmen in the office at the time of the adoption of this charter shall continue in office until the expiration of the term for which they were elected, subject to the provisions of this charter, so that three councilmen shall be elected at the election to be held on the first Saturday in April, 1972, and two councilmen shall be elected at the election to be held on the first Saturday in April, 1973; and annually thereafter there shall be elected three and two councilmen, respectively; that is, in each odd-numbered year two councilmen shall be elected and in each even-numbered year three councilmen shall be elected. 
(d)  All councilmen shall represent the entire city as a whole, and all candidates shall run at large at any election to be held for the office of councilman. In the event that such system shall be hereinafter declared invalid by the Supreme Court of Texas or the Supreme Court of the United States, or by the legislature of the State of Texas, or by the final judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction in a direct attack brought upon the City of Waxahachie, the city council shall be empowered to enact by ordinance a division of the city into such districts or wards as may be consistent with the terms of such judgment or legislation, and to provide for: 
(1)  The designation of such districts or wards by name or number; 
(2)  The assignment of councilmen then in office to such districts or wards; and 
(3)  The election thereafter of councilmen to represent such districts or wards, all with such residential qualifications as may be decreed or provided by such decree, judgment or legislative enactment. 
Section 2.02. - Compensation and expenses.

The mayor shall preside at meetings of the council, shall be recognized as head of the city government for all ceremonial purposes and by the governor for purposes of military law but shall have no administrative duties. The mayor pro tem shall act as mayor during the absence or disability of the mayor. 
Section 2.04. - General powers and duties. 
    All powers of the city shall be vested in the council, except as otherwise provided by law or this charter, and the council shall provide for the exercise thereof and for the performance of all duties and obligations imposed on the city by law. 
Section 2.05. - Prohibitions. 
(a)  Holding other office. Except where authorized by law, no councilman shall hold any other city office or employment during the term for which he was elected to the council, and no former councilman shall hold any compensated appointive city office or employment until one year after the expiration of the term for which he was elected to the council. 
(b)  Appointments and removals. Neither the council nor any of its members shall in any manner dictate the appointment or removal of any city administrative officers or employees whom the manager or any of his subordinates are empowered to appoint, but the council may express its views and fully and freely discuss with the manager anything pertaining to the appointment and removal of such officers and employees. 
(c)  Interference with administration. Except for the purpose of inquiries and investigations under section 2.09 [2.10], the council or its members shall deal with city officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of the manager solely through the manager, and neither the council nor its members shall give orders to any such officer or employee, either publicly or privately. 
Section 2.06. - Vacancies, forfeiture of office, filling of vacancies. 
(a)  Vacancies. The office of a councilman shall become vacant upon his death, resignation, removal from office in any manner authorized by law, or forfeiture of his office. 
(b)  Forfeiture of office. A councilman shall forfeit his office if he: 
(1)  Lacks at any time during his term of office any qualification for the office prescribed by this charter or by law; 
(2)  Violates any expressed prohibition of this charter; 
(3)  Is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude; or 
(4)  Fails to attend three consecutive regular meetings of the council without being excused by the council. 
(c)  Filling of vacancies. Vacancies in the council arising from any cause shall be filled by majority vote of the remaining members of the council. Such appointee shall hold office until a successor is qualified at next regular election for the remaining unexpired term, if any.

Section 5.30. - Purchase procedure. 
    All purchases made and contracts executed by the city shall be pursuant to a written requisition from the head of the office, department or agency whose appropriation will be charged, and no contract or order shall be binding upon the city unless and until the director of finance certifies that there is to the credit of such office, department or agency a sufficient unencumbered appropriation and allotment balance to pay for the supplies, materials, equipment, or contractual services, for which the contract or order is to be used. The council may by ordinance confer upon the city manager general authority to contract for expenditures without further approval of the council for all budgeted items not exceeding three thousand dollars ($3,000.00), or as permitted by state law.

Section 10.09. - Effect of the charter on existing law. 
    All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations now in force under the city government of Waxahachie and not in conflict with the provisions of this charter, shall remain in force under this charter until altered, amended or repealed by the council after this charter takes effect. All rights of the city under existing franchises and contracts are preserved in full force and effect to the city. 
Section 10.10. - Interim municipal government. 
    From and after the date of the adoption of this charter the persons then filing elective offices which are retained under this charter will continue to fill those offices for the terms for which they were elected, until succeeded by duly elected and qualified successors, as elsewhere provided in this charter. Persons who, on the date this chapter is adopted, are filling appointive positions which are retained under this charter, may continue to fill such positions for the term for which they were appointed, subject to the provisions of this charter. 
Section 10.11. - Applicability of general law. 
    The Constitutions of the United States and the State of Texas, the statutes of the state applicable to Home-Rule Municipal Corporations as now or hereafter enacted, this charter and the ordinances enacted pursuant hereto shall, in the order mentioned, be applicable to the city. The city shall also have the power to exercise any and all powers conferred by the laws of the State of Texas on any other city, not contrary to the provisions of said Home-Rule Act, state statutes and this charter. The exercise of any such powers by the city shall be optional with it, and it shall not be required to conform to the law governing any other cities unless and until by ordinance it adopts same. 
Section 10.12. - Amending the charter. 
    Amendments to this charter may be formulated and submitted to the voters of the City in the manner provided by chapter 13 of title 28 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as now or hereafter amended. 
Section 10.13. - Construction of the charter. 
    In the wording of the charter, the use of the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa. Words used in the masculine gender shall include the feminine, and vice versa, unless by reasonable construction it appears that such was not the intention of the charter. The use of the word city shall be construed to be the City of Waxahachie, Texas. The phrase "governing body" and "council" shall mean the city council or other elective body of the city. 
Section 10.14. - Construction of power. 
    This charter shall not be construed as a mere grant of enumerated powers, but shall be construed as a general grant of power and as a limitation of power of the government of the city in the same manner as the constitution of the State of Texas is construed as a limitation on the powers of the legislature. Except where expressly prohibited by this charter, each and every power under article XI, section 5, of the constitution of Texas shall be construed to be granted to the city by the charter. 
Section 10.15. - Prohibitions. 
(a)  No person shall be appointed to or removed from, or in any way favored or discriminated against with respect to any city position or appointive office because of race, sex, or political or religious opinions or affiliations. 
(b)  No person shall willfully make any false statement, certificate, mark, rating or report in regard to any test, certificate or appointment under the personnel provision of this charter or the rules and regulations made thereunder, or in any manner commit or attempt to commit any fraud preventing the impartial execution of such provisions, rules and regulations. 
(c)  No person who seeks appointment or promotion for any city position or office shall directly or indirectly give, render or pay any money, service or other valuable thing to any person for or in connection with his test, appointment, proposed appointment, promotion or proposed promotion. 
(d)  No person shall orally, by letter or otherwise solicit or assist in soliciting any assessment, subscription or contribution for any municipal political party or municipal political purpose whatever from any person holding any compensated appointive city position. 
(e)  No person who holds any compensated appointive city position shall make, solicit or receive any contribution to the campaign funds of any municipal political party or any candidate for city office or take any part in the management, affairs or political campaign of any municipal political party or candidate for city office, but he may exercise his rights as a citizen to express his opinions and to cast his vote. 
(f)  Any person who by himself or with others willfully violates any of the provisions of paragraphs (1) [a] through (e) above shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars ($200.00). Any person convicted under this section shall be ineligible for a period of five years thereafter to hold any city office or position and, if an officer or employee of the city, shall immediately forfeit his office or position. 
Section 10.16. - Submission of charter to voters. 
    The charter commission in preparing this charter finds and decides that it is impracticable to segregate each subject so as to permit a vote of "yes" or "no" on same, for the reason that the charter is so constructed that in order to enable it to work and function, it is necessary that it be adopted in its entirety. For these reasons, the charter commission directs that the said charter be voted upon as a whole and that it will be submitted to the qualified voters of the city at an election to be held for that purpose on the third day of April, 1971. Not less than thirty days prior to such election the city council shall cause the city secretary to mail a copy of this charter to each qualified voter of the city, as appears from the latest complete tax collector's roll. 
    If a majority of the qualified voters voting in such election shall vote in favor of the adoption of this existing charter, it shall become the charter of the City of Waxahachie, and the charter and all amendments thereto shall be thereby repealed, and, after the returns have been canvassed, the same shall be declared adopted and the city secretary shall file an official copy of the charter with the records of the city. The secretary shall furnish the mayor a copy of said charter, which copy of the charter so adopted, authenticated and certified by his signature and seal of the city, shall be forwarded to the secretary of state of the State of Texas and shall show the approval of such charter by majority vote of the qualified voters voting at such election. 
    We, the undersigned members of the Waxahachie Charter Commission heretofore duly elected to prepare a charter for the city do hereby certify that this publication constitutes a true copy of the proposed charter for the City of Waxahachie, Texas, as unanimously adopted by the members thereof:

Sec. 2-36. - Lateral entry for police officers and firefighters. 
(a)  The city council adopts the Waxahachie Civil Service Pay Structure and all applicable extra pay types annually as part of the city's budget, and the ordinance codified in this section is intended to explicate and supplement the pay structure ordinance. 
(1)  The city council authorizes the lateral entry pay for police officers and firefighters as defined in subsection (b) herein. 
(2)  Detailed rules and regulations for qualifying standards, eligibility, and administration of such pay may be stated within city and/or departmental policies. Such policies are subject to change as needed and approved by the city manager for purposes of city policies or by the department chiefs for purposes of department policies. 
(3)  Changes in the actual base pay amount shall be made through an ordinance amending such. 
(b)  Lateral entry (prior experience): 
(1)  The base pay structure is authorized by V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 143.041(c)(1). 
(2)  Applicants for police officer or firefighter positions who are hired after January 20, 2015 shall be eligible for lateral entry pay if they have at least three (3) years continuous service as a paid, full-time licensed peace officer with the authority to enforce laws, investigate crimes, make arrests, respond to calls for service, carry a firearm, and use discretion as part of their assigned duties or a certified paid, full-time firefighter/EMT. A lateral entry applicant shall not have more than a two-year break in service from the time the applicant left a comparable law enforcement or fire suppression agency and the time the applicant applied with the Waxahachie Police or Fire Department. 
(3)  Starting pay. The starting pay for lateral entry officers or firefighters with prior experience will be determined based on the number of years employed by their previous agency or agencies on the date of their civil service entrance examination with the Waxahachie Police or Fire Department. For purposes of hiring, all lateral entry officer candidates must successfully complete each step in the civil service hiring process in the same manner as any other candidate. 
a.  Lateral entry officers or firefighters who have at least three (3) years of qualified service at a law enforcement or fire agency shall be credited with their total number of whole years of service. These officers shall be initially placed at the step below the pay structure step commensurate with their qualified years of experience up to, but not exceeding, the rate of pay specified in beginning pay level of Step 7 for police and pay level 6 for fire. 
b.  Previous Waxahachie Police Officers who are re-appointed as police officers shall be placed in the same salary step they held at the time of their resignation unless the applicant terminated while at a supervisory rank. If the re-appointed officer left the Waxahachie Police Department while in a supervisory capacity, then the re-appointed officer's pay shall correspond with the re-appointed officer's total prior service years, but shall not exceed the top pay of police officer rank. 
(4)  Departmental seniority impact. The lateral entry program described herein is for lateral entry pay purposes only to determine placement into the existing pay structure. Actual work experience in another agency will not be considered for promotional eligibility requirements, departmental seniority or transfers. Departmental seniority for lateral entry officers or firefighters and re-appointed officers will begin on their most recent civil service hire date with the department. 
(5)  Requirements. Guidelines and administration for eligibility for lateral entry shall be governed by department policies. The department chief shall make the final determination as to whether an applicant meets the criteria for the lateral entry program and the chief's decision shall be final and non-appealable to the civil service commission or to any court.

(5)  Fail to keep clean and presentable while on duty; 
(6)  Use abusive or obscene language, or fail to use professional conduct; 
(7)  Release a patient from ambulance service until care of that patient has been expressly transferred to another health care professional capable of providing care necessary for the health and well-being of the patient; or the patient has been examined, advised of the seriousness of his/her condition and been offered ambulance transportation to a health care facility or other direction as established by the medical director; 
(8)  Use a siren or flashing overhead lights of any color or configuration on a city street for the purpose of clearing traffic, unless on an emergency response authorized by the dispatch center; 
(9)  Disobey the lawful orders of a fire or police officer at the scene of an accident, or other similar emergency; 
(10)  Smoke or use any tobacco product while driving an ambulance or while attending a patient; or 
(11)  Fail to comply with applicable state and municipal laws. 
(Ord. No. 2833 , Exh. A, 11-16-15) 
Sec. 41/2-94. - Professional conduct. 
    All personnel employed by the provider including all persons involved in billing and collection activities, shall, at all times, conduct themselves in a professional manner. 
(Ord. No. 2833 , Exh. A, 11-16-15) 
Sec. 41/2-95. - Patient and on-scene management. 
(a)  Waxahachie Fire-Rescue is responsible for overall scene safety and management of all responders and patients. The provider is included in standard operating procedures within the incident command system and has command responsibilities prior to the arrival of the fire department. Once the fire department arrives on scene, the command responsibilities for scene safety and management are transferred to the ranking fire officer who shall function as the incident commander. The incident commander shall implement the incident command system. The incident command system means the on-scene management of an emergency incident and the structure and organization of responding resources within a standard hierarchy. All resources, including resources of the provider and its subcontractors, are subject to the direct orders and assignments of the incident commander and sector officers in order to affect the timely and orderly mitigation of the emergency. 
(b)  Patient care and medical control issues are controlled by policies issued by the medical director. Generally, the first arriving advanced life support provider with the highest level of certification shall control patient care unless patient care responsibility is transferred to and accepted by another provider of at least equal level of certification. 
(c)  The determination regarding management of patient care and medical control should consider the following: 
(1)  The scene of an emergency medical incident shall be managed by the fire department in a manner calculated to maximize the life safety of all responders while simultaneously minimizing the risk of death or health impairment to the patient and other persons who may be exposed to risk as a result of the emergency condition. 
(2)  Police emergency: In the event that the senior officer of the police department present at the scene determines that a police emergency condition exists, the officer shall inform the EMS provider in charge that such condition exists. Upon such notification, the EMS provider at the scene shall defer to the command of the police officer. 
(3)  Waxahachie Fire-Rescue first responders shall ordinarily consult with the provider paramedic in charge at the scene in determining relevant risk factors. 
(4)  Because all city EMS personnel, both fire department first responders and provider personnel have met requirements specified by the medical director, they have medical authority over non-Waxahachie first responders and ambulance personnel (not to exceed state credentials), and law enforcement personnel. 
(5)  All city providers have a duty to act and must continue to provide appropriate care to patients within the scope of their certification or licensure. 
(6)  Medical authority over patient care shall rest solely upon the first arriving city provider until such time as that authority is passed to a provider paramedic or hospital physician. That transition is mandatory when a Waxahachie first responder assumes initial medical authority. The provider paramedic assumes that responsibility during transport of the patient. Transition of medical authority from first responders to transporting paramedics occur only after a verbal patient report is conveyed and the provider-patient relationship has been relinquished. The provider assuming patient care must have a full understanding of the patient's condition and the treatments and interventions that have been performed or are still needed. 
(7)  City first responders and providers may allow properly identified medical personnel to assist with patient care, but shall maintain medical authority prior to the arrival of an ambulance. 
(8)  In the event a physician licensed to practice medicine in Texas or authorized under federal law is present and desires to assume direction and control of patient care and issue medical orders which conflict with those of the medical control physician, he/she may do so only after communicating with the medical control physician by radio and if he/she accompanies the patient to the hospital in the ambulance. The physician who assumes medical direction and control at the scene thus releases the on-scene ambulance personnel from responsibility for directing patient care. 
(9)  In cases where conflict regarding patient care exists between city paramedics on scene and there is a belief that a negligent act or policy deviation that will harm the patient is about to, or has occurred, then the paramedic with that belief shall initiate conflict resolution procedures approved by the fire chief and medical director. 
(Ord. No. 2833 , Exh. A, 11-16-15) 
Sec. 41/2-96. - Suspension or revocation of ambulance personnel's privileges. 
    The medical director or fire chief or his designee, as appropriate, shall have the power to suspend, alter or revoke the privileges of ambulance personnel for the following: 
(1)  Failure to meet the requirements in this chapter; 
(2)  Failure to remain continuously employed by provider; 
(3)  Violation of rules in this chapter; or 
(4)  Failure to comply with rules and regulations established by the fire chief, medical director or city council. 
    The fire chief or his designee may recommend suspension and/or revocation of privileges to the medical director who shall cause an investigation to be made into the circumstances surrounding the proposed suspension and/or revocation. The fire chief or his designee may at any time give notice in writing to the certification holder that the certification has been revoked. The notice shall outline the reason or reasons for revocation. The notice of revocation shall become a final revocation after the expiration of three (3) days from the date of the service of same, unless on or before the expiration of such three (3) days the certification holder shall file with the medical director a written appeal of such revocation. The appeal shall operate as a stay of revocation of the certification issued until such time as the medical director shall grant a hearing and make a final adjudication. Provided, however, the fire chief or his designee may require immediate suspension of the certification for public safety purposes. If this requirement is made, the certification shall be suspended during the period in which the appeal is pending. The hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after the date of filing of the appeal, and such action and judgment of the medical director, after hearing all the evidence and facts, shall be final and conclusive as to all parties. 
(Ord. No. 2833 , Exh. A, 11-16-15) 
Sec. 41/2-97. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
    When the driver of an ambulance has reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency exists, the driver of the ambulance may: 
(1)  Park or stand, irrespective of the otherwise applicable provisions of law, ordinance or regulations; 
(2)  Proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, but only after slowing down as may be necessary for safe operation; 
(3)  Exceed the maximum speed limits permitted by law, ordinance or regulation; provided, however, that any governing directives issued by the fire chief are obeyed and that life and property are not endangered thereby; or 
(4)  Disregard laws, ordinances and regulations governing directions or movements or turning in specified directions. 
    Provided, however, that any exemption herein granted shall apply only when such ambulance is operating with siren or flashing overhead lights and when such audible and visual signals meet the requirements of law, ordinance or regulation; and provided further, that the foregoing provision shall not operate to relieve the driver of any ambulance from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor shall such provisions protect the driver from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others.

ARTICLE V. - PURPOSE 

Sec. 41/2-121. - Purpose. 
(a)  The regulation of ambulances and emergency ambulances as herein established has been made in the exercise of the sound discretion of the city council, and the city council finds that such regulations are necessary for the purpose of promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the community; that such regulations have been designed to lessen congestion by emergency vehicles on the public streets and to secure safety to pedestrians and vehicles using the public streets and thoroughfares; that such regulations are necessary to protect health, life and property; that such regulations apply to all providers of ambulances as a whole operating for hire under emergency conditions, or otherwise, on the streets and public thoroughfares in such a manner as to minimize the hazards and dangers inherent in the operations of ambulances under emergency conditions; and that public necessity requires that such regulations be adopted to preserve and enforce the health, safety and welfare, and the good order and security of the city and its inhabitants. 
(b)  To establish a regulated ambulance service system which can provide state-of-the-art clinical quality of care, with reasonable, reliable response time standards, and with the goal of furnishing the best possible chance of survival, without disability or preventable complication, to each ambulance user. 
(c)  To establish a sole-provider ambulance system, because it is unreasonable to have unnecessarily high rates or public subsidy to make needed improvements to ambulance service in Waxahachie, when a more efficiently designed system can achieve the same results at lower cost. The most efficient design to achieve the goals of high quality service at the lowest cost consistent with the quality of care required is the implementation of the system described herein. 
(d)  To provide more effective system performance through the provision of services by a competitively selected ambulance provider. 
(e)  To establish minimum requirements for non-emergency ambulance transportation. 
(f)  To ensure that pre-hospital emergency medical care provided throughout the city, regardless of the setting or provider, is compatible with that authorized by the medical director for the city ambulance contractor.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 81/2-1. - Regulations adopted. 
    The following regulations are hereby adopted and shall be known as the cable TV regulations for the City of Waxahachie, Texas. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 1, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-2. - Definitions. 
    Unless otherwise apparent, the following definitions shall apply in this chapter: 
    Affiliated programmer. An affiliated programmer is a programmer with an ownership interest of five (5) percent or more including general partnership interests, direct ownership interests, and stock interests in a corporation where such stockholders are officers or directors or who directly or indirectly own five (5) percent or more of the outstanding stock, whether voting or nonvoting. Such interests include limited partnership interests of five (5) percent or greater. 
    Basic service tier. The basic service tier shall, at a minimum, include all signals of domestic television broadcast stations provided to any subscriber (except a signal secondarily transmitted by satellite carrier beyond the local service area of such station, regardless of how such signal is ultimately received by the cable system), any public, educational, and governmental programming required by the franchise to be carried on the basic tier, and any additional video programming signals or service added to the basic tier by the cable operator. 
    Cable operator. Cable operator means any person or group of persons who provides cable service over a cable system within the city under a franchise issued by the city, and who directly or through one (1) or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such cable system, or who otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any arrangement, the management and operation of such a cable system. 
    Cable programming service. Cable programming service includes any video programming provided over a cable system, regardless of service tier, including installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of such video programming, other than: 
(1)  Video programming carried on the basic service tier as defined in this section; 
(2)  Video programming offered on a pay-per-channel or pay-per-program basis; or 
(3)  A combination of multiple channels of pay-per-channel or pay-per-program video programming offered on a multiplexed or time-shifted basis so long as the combined service; 
a.  Consists of commonly-identified video programming; 
b.  Is not bundled with any regulated tier of service. 
    City. The City of Waxahachie, Texas. 
    Commission. The Federal Communications Commission. 
    Small system. A small system is a cable television system that serves fewer than one thousand (1,000) subscribers. The service area of a small system is determined by the number of subscribers that are served by a system's principal headend, including any other headends or microwave receive sites that are technically integrated to the system's principal headend. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 2, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-3. - Information to be provided by cable operator on monthly subscriber bills. 
    A cable operator must provide the following information to subscribers on monthly bills: 
(a)  A statement substantially the same as the following: 
    "The basic service tier rates and related equipment and installation charges are regulated by the city. If you have any questions or comments regarding these rates, you may call or write the city at 401 S. Rogers, Waxahachie, Texas 75165, (214) 937-7330"; and 
(b)  The FCC community unit identifier for the cable system. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 3, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-4. - Negative option billing. 
    A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. This provision, however, shall not preclude the addition or deletion of a specific program from a service offering, the addition or deletion of specific channels from an existing tier of service, or the restructuring or division of existing tiers of service that do not result in a fundamental change in the nature of an existing service or tier of service, provided that such change is otherwise consistent with applicable regulations. A subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment is not an affirmative request for service or equipment. A subscriber's affirmative request for service or equipment may be made orally or in writing. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 4, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-5. - Subscriber bill itemization. 
(a)  Cable operators may identify as a separate line item of each regular subscriber bill the following: 
(1)  The amount of the total bill assessed as a franchise fee. 
(2)  The amount of the total bill assessed to satisfy any requirement imposed on the cable operator by the franchise agreement to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels. 
(3)  The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber. In order for a governmental fee or assessment to be separately identified under this section, it must be directly imposed by a governmental body on a transaction between a subscriber and an operator. 
(b)  The charge identified on the subscriber bill as the total charge for cable service should include all fees and costs itemized pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 5, 11-1-93) 
Secs. 81/2-6-81/2-20. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - RATES 

Sec. 81/2-21. - Rates for the basic service tier. 
(a)  Generally. Basic service tier rates are subject to regulation by the city in order to assure that they are in compliance with the requirements of 47 U.S.C. [section] 543. Rates that are demonstrated, in accordance with this chapter, not to exceed the "initial permitted per channel charge" or the "subsequent permitted per channel charge" as described below, or the equipment charges as specified in section 81/2-22, will be accepted as in compliance. The maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier offered by a cable operator shall consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. The maximum monthly charges for the basic service tier shall not include any charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and installations are to be calculated separately pursuant to section 81/2-22 of this chapter. 
(b)  Initial permitted per channel charge. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, the initial date of regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that: 
a.  The city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier; and 
b.  This chapter has been adopted by the city. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, rates "in effect on the initial date of regulation" or "in effect on September 30, 1992," shall be the rates charged to subscribers for service received on that respective date. 
(3)  The permitted per channel charge on the initial date of regulation shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
a.  A charge determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding; or 
b.  The charge specified in subparagraphs (1), (2), or (3) of this paragraph, as applicable: 
1.  If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is equal to or below the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the date of initial regulation, then the permitted per channel charge shall be the per channel charge in effect on the date of initial regulation, adjusted for equipment. 
2.  If: 
(i)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
(ii)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was above the benchmark per channel charge; 
then the permitted per channel charge is nine-tenths ( 9/10 ) of the per channel charge in effect on September 30, 1992, but no lower than the benchmark per channel charge, additionally adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tiers. 
3.  If: 
(i)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
(ii)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was below the benchmark per channel charge; 
then the permitted per channel charge is the benchmark rate per channel adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tier. 
(c)  Subsequent permitted per channel charge. After the initial date of regulation, the permitted channel charge for the basic service tier shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
(1)  A per channel rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing; or 
(2)  The prior permitted per channel charge previously approved by the city, adjusted for inflation and external costs in accordance with the price cap requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. 
(d)  Price cap requirements. 
(1)  Inflation adjustments. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may be adjusted periodically on account of inflation. Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of inflation shall be based on changes in the gross national product price index ("GNP-PI") published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce. 
(2)  External costs. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may also be adjusted for changes in external costs measured on a per channel per subscriber basis. To the extent external cost increases are greater or less than the GNP-PI for the relevant period, the per channel charge will be adjusted accordingly. Per channel charges may not be increased if external costs other than franchise fees increase at a rate less than inflation. Permitted per channel charges also shall be decreased on account of external costs to the extent such costs decrease from previous levels. 
a.  Categories. External costs shall consist of costs in the following categories: 
1.  State and local taxes applicable to provision of cable television service; 
2.  Franchise fees; 
3.  Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including costs of providing public, educational, and governmental access channels as required by the city; 
4.  Retransmission consent fees; 
5.  Programming costs. 
b.  The permitted per channel charge for the basic service tier shall be adjusted on account of programming costs and retransmission consent fees only for programming or broadcast signals offered on that tier. 
c.  The permitted per channel charge shall not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or charges in those fees incurred prior to October 6, 1994. 
d.  The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs for the basic service tier shall be the initial date of regulation or one hundred eighty (180) days from September 1, 1993, if the initial date of regulation occurs on or after one hundred eighty (180) days from September 1, 1993. 
e.  Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to permitted per channel charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as part of the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier. 
f.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming obtained from affiliated programmers shall be the lesser of actual increases or the previous permitted rate level increased by the amount of inflation. 
g.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues received by the operator from the programmer. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 6, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-22. - Rates for equipment and installation used to receive the basic service tier. 
(a)  Scope. The equipment regulated under this section consists of all equipment in a subscriber's location that is used to receive the basic service tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive other tiers of regulated programming service and/or unregulated service. Such equipment shall include, but is not limited to: 
(1)  Converter boxes; 
(2)  Remote control units; 
(3)  Connections for additional television receivers; and 
(4)  Other cable home wiring. 
    Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth below. 
(b)  Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation, and additional connections separate from rates for basic service tier. In addition, the rates for such equipment and installations shall be unbundled one from the other. 
(c)  Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an equipment basket, which will include all costs associated with providing customer equipment and installations under this section. Equipment basket costs shall be limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of providing, leasing, installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment, as determined in accordance with the cost accounting and cost allocation requirements of section 81/2-23. The equipment basket shall not include general administrative overhead including general marketing expenses. The equipment basket may include a reasonable profit. 
(d)  Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges for equipment and installation using the hourly service charge ("HSC") methodology. The HSC shall equal the operator's annual equipment basket costs, excluding the purchase cost of customer equipment, divided by the total person hours involved in installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment during the same period. The purchase cost of customer equipment shall include the cable operator's invoice price plus all other costs incurred with respect to the equipment until the time it is provided to the customer. The HSC is calculated according to the following formula: 
HSC =  EB - CE  H  
Where, 
EB = Annual equipment basket cost; CE = Annual purchase cost of all customer equipment; and H = Person hours involved in installing and repairing equipment per year.  
(e)  Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either: 
(1)  The HSC multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual installation; or 
(2)  The HSC multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type of installation. 
(f)  Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control unit shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of the type of remote leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales tax, financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the customer, added to the product of the HSC times the average number of hours annually repairing or servicing a remote, divided by twelve (12) to determine the monthly lease rate for a remote according to the following formula: 
Monthly charge = UCE + (HSC × HR) 12  
Where, 
HR = Average hours repair per year; and UCE = Average annual unit cost of remote.  
    Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of remote control unit. 
(g)  Other equipment charges. The monthly charges for rental of converter boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as for remote control units. Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of converter box and each significantly different type of other customer equipment. 
(h)  Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges associated with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at rate levels determined by the actual cost methodology presented in the foregoing paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. An operator may recover additional programming costs and the costs of signal boosters on the customers premises, if any, associated with the additional connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional connections. 
(i)  Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover the operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with storing and preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold to the customer, plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service contracts for the maintenance and repair of equipment sold to subscribers. The charge for a service contract shall be the HSC times the estimated average number of hours for maintenance and repair over the life of the equipment. 
(j)  Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation at charges below those determined under paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, as long as those offerings are reasonable in scope in relation to the operator's overall offerings in the equipment basket and not unreasonably discriminatory. Operators may not recover the cost of a promotional offering by increasing charges for other equipment basket elements, or by increasing programming service rates above the maximum monthly charge per subscriber prescribed by this chapter. As part of a general cost-of-service showing, an operator may include the cost of promotions in its general system overhead costs. 
(k)  Franchise fees. Equipment charges may include a properly allocated portion of franchise fees paid to the city. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 7, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-23. - Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements. 
(a)  Applicability. The requirements of this section are applicable for purposes of rate adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-of-service showings. 
(b)  Generally accepted accounting principles. Cable operators shall maintain their accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except as otherwise directed by the city. 
(c)  Accounts required. Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application of the city's cost assignment and allocation procedures, to cost categories necessary for rate adjustments due to changes in external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed and supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting records. 
(d)  Accounting level. Except to the extent indicated below, cable operators shall aggregate expenses and revenues at either the franchise, system, regional, or company level in a manner consistent with practices of the operator as of April 3, 1992. However, in all events, cable operators shall identify at the franchise level their costs of franchise requirements, franchise fees, local taxes, and local programming. 
(e)  Cost allocation requirements. 
(1)  For purposes of establishing expenses at the franchise level, cable operators shall allocate expenses and revenues aggregate at higher levels to the franchise level based on the ratio of the total number of subscribers served at the franchise level to the total number of subscribers served at the higher level. 
(2)  Except to the extent indicated below, all categories of costs allocated to, or identified at, the franchise level shall be allocated to the basic service tier based on the ratio of channels in the basic tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area, including nonregulated and leased commercial access channels. These costs shall be allocated to each tier of cable programming services based on the ratio of channels in that tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area. 
(3)  Costs of programming and retransmission consent fees, however, shall be allocated only to the tier on which the programming or broadcast signal at issue is offered. 
(4)  Costs of franchise fees shall be allocated among equipment and installations, program service tiers and subscribers in a manner that is most consistent with the methodology of assessment of franchise fees by the city. 
(5)  Costs of public, educational, and governmental access channels carried on the basic tier shall be directly assigned to the basic tier where possible. 
(f)  Common costs. Expenses which cannot be assigned to any single expense or service category shall be described as common costs. Common costs shall be allocated to expense categories as follows: 
(1)  Wherever possible, common costs are to be allocated to service cost categories based on direct analysis of the origin of the costs themselves. 
(2)  When direct analysis is not possible, common costs shall, if possible, be allocated to service cost categories based on an indirect, cost-causative linkage to other costs directly assigned or allocated to the service cost category. 
(3)  When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation can be found, common costs shall be allocated to each service cost category based on the ratio of all costs directly assigned and attributed to a service cost category over total costs directly assignable and attributable. 
(g)  Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude from cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of basic service tier and equipment, any direct or indirect expenses and revenues not related to the provision of such services. Common costs of providing basic service tier and equipment, and unrelated activities shall be allocated between them in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. 
(h)  Part-time channels. In situations where a single channel is divided on a part-time basis and is used to deliver service associated with different tiers or with pay per channel or pay per view service, a reasonable and documented allocation of that channel between services shall be required along with the associated revenues and costs. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 8, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-24. - Costs of franchise requirements. 
(a)  The costs of satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels shall consist of the sum of: 
(1)  All per channel costs for the number of channels used to meet franchise requirements for public, educational, and governmental channels; 
(2)  Any direct costs of meeting such franchise requirements; and 
(3)  A reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(b)  The costs of satisfying any other requirement under the franchise shall consist of the direct and indirect costs, including a reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 9, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-25. - Charges for customer changes. 
(a)  This section shall govern charges for any changes in service tiers or equipment provided to the subscriber that are initiated at the request of a subscriber after initial service installation. 
(b)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods shall be a nominal amount, not exceeding actual costs, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. 
(c)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers or equipment that involve more than coded entry on a computer or other similarly simple method shall be based on actual cost. The actual cost charge shall be either the HSC, as defined in section 81/2-21 of this chapter, multiplied by the number of person hours needed to implement the change, or the HSC multiplied by the average number of person hours involved in implementing customer changes. 
(d)  A cable operator may establish a higher charge for changes effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods, subject to approval by the city, for a subscriber changing service tiers more than two (2) times in a twelve-month period, except for such changes ordered in response to a change in price or channel line-up. If a cable system adopts such an increased charge, the cable system must notify all subscribers in writing that they may be subject to such a charge for changing service tiers more than the specified number of times in any twelve-month period. 
(e)  Downgrade charges that are the same as, or lower than, upgrade charges are evidence of the reasonableness of such downgrade charges.

The notice shall include a provision stating that protests to such prices may be filed with the city at 401 S. Rogers. The notice shall also include a statement that such protests must be filed with the city no later than thirty (30) days after the notice is received by the subscriber. 
(b)  In addition to the notice required in paragraph (a), the cable operator shall give the city a minimum of thirty (30) days advance written notification of any changes in rates for cable programming service or associated equipment. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 11, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-32. - Initiation of review of basic cable service and equipment rates. 
    A cable operator shall file its schedule of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment with the city within thirty (30) days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier, or by November 15, 1993, whichever is later. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 12, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-33. - City review of basic cable rates and equipment costs. 
(a)  After a cable operator has submitted to the city for review its existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment costs, or a proposed increase in these rates (including increases in the baseline channel charge that results from reductions in the number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed rates will become effective after thirty (30) days from the date of submission to the city. Provided, however, that the city may toll this thirty-day deadline for an additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in paragraph (d) within thirty (30) days of the rate submission explaining that it needs additional time to review the rates. The city may, at any time, require the cable operator to produce additional information, including proprietary information, that the city deems necessary in order to make a rate determination. If proprietary information is provided, the provisions of section 81/2-34 hereof will apply to such information. 
(b)  Upon receipt by the city, the cable operator's submittal shall be available for public inspection and copying. Comments on the submittal by interested persons may be submitted in writing or orally at a city council meeting held at any time during the initial thirty-day review period. Written comments shall be addressed to City Manager, City of Waxahachie, 401 S. Rogers, Waxahachie, Texas 75165, and must be received prior to the end of the thirty-day review period. 
(c)  If a cable operator submits a proposed rate increase for review that appears to exceed the presumptively reasonable level and does not include a cost-of-service showing to justify the rate the city will permit the cable operator to cure this deficiency and submit a cost-of-service showing. 
(d)  If the city is unable to determine, based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the existing or proposed rates are within the permitted basic service tier charge or actual cost of equipment as defined in sections 81/2-21 and 81/2-22 hereof, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to sections 81/2-23 and 81/2-35 hereof, seeking to justify a rate above the basic service tier charge as defined in sections 81/2-21 and 81/2-22 hereof, the city may toll the thirty-day deadline in paragraph (a) of this section to request and/or consider additional information or to consider the comments from interested parties as follows: 
(1)  For an additional ninety (90) days in cases not involving cost-of-service showings; or 
(2)  For an additional one hundred fifty (150) days in cases involving cost-of-service showings. 
    The order tolling the effective date of the proposed rate shall explain why the city could not make the necessary determination, and it shall also provide the cable operator an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in its original filing. During the additional time periods provided in this paragraph, comments from interested persons may be submitted in writing, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, or orally during at least one (1) city council meeting during the period of abatement. 
(e)  If the city has availed itself of the additional ninety (90) days or one hundred fifty (150) days permitted in paragraph (c) of this section, and has taken no action within these additional time periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at the end of the ninety- or one hundred fifty-day periods, or existing rates will remain in effect at such times, subject to refunds if the city subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates. Provided, however, that in order to order refunds, the city must have issued a brief written order to the cable operator by the end of the ninety-day or one hundred fifty-day period permitted in paragraph (c) of this section directing the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 13, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-34. - Proprietary information. 
(a)  If the city has required the cable operator to produce proprietary information under the provisions of this chapter, the cable operator may submit therewith a request that such information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any materials to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(b)  Each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from inspection and of the facts upon which those reasons are based. If the request is that the materials be withheld from inspection for a limited period of time, that period shall be specified. 
(c)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a request in compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b), the city will not grant routine public access to the materials. A letter to that effect will be placed in a public file in lieu of the materials withheld from public inspection. 
(e)  Provided, however, if a written request for the materials is received by the city pursuant to the Open Records Act, Chapter 552, Texas Government Code, the city will notify the person providing the materials of the request for the materials. If the person providing the materials requests the city to do so, the city will request an opinion from the attorney general, pursuant to the Open Records Act, regarding the public availability of the materials. If the person providing the materials does not request the city to request an opinion from the attorney general, the city may, at its option, either request such an opinion or provide the materials to the public. 
(f)  If the attorney general issues an opinion or letter ruling requiring the city to make the materials available to the public, the materials will be made available for public inspection. 
(g)  If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the city assumes no obligation to consider the need for nondisclosure.

(b)  For an existing or a proposed rate for basic service tier or associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual cost of equipment as set forth in sections 81/2-21 and 81/2-22, the cable operator must submit the appropriate FCC form to the city. 
(c)  For an existing or a proposed rate for basic service tier that exceeds the permitted tier charge as set forth in sections 81/2-21 and 81/2-22 hereof, the cable operator must submit to the city a cost-of-service showing to justify the proposed rates. The cost-of-service showing must be in conformance with accounting and cost allocation requirements as adopted and amended by the commission for cable system operators. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 15, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-36. - Small systems. 
(a)  A small system, as defined in section 81/2-2, may certify that the small system's rates for basic service and associated equipment, and subsequent rate increases, comply with section 81/2-21 hereof. A certification by a small system under this section for its initial rates shall be filed with the city within thirty (30) days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier. Certifications for subsequent rate increases shall be filed with the city at the same time that notice is given to the small system's subscribers of the proposed rate increase, in conformance with section 81/2-31 hereof. All certifications shall be in writing, shall be signed by the general manager of the system, and shall be verified. 
(b)  Such certification shall be subject to verification by the city on its own motion or upon complaint by a subscriber. The city may request additional information from the operator in order to verify the certification. In the event proprietary information is requested by the city, the provisions of section 81/2-34 hereof shall control the availability of such information to the public. 
(c)  If the city determines that the small system's certification is in error, it shall so notify the small system operator and shall require the small system to comply with all filing requirements for non-small systems in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 16, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-37. - Written decision. 
(a)  The city shall issue a written decision in a ratemaking proceeding whenever it disapproves an initial rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment in whole or in part, disapproves a request for a rate increase in whole or in part, or approves a request for an increase in whole or in part over the objections of interested parties. The city is not required to issue a written decision that approves an unopposed existing or proposed rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment. 
(b)  Public notice shall be given of any written decision required in paragraph (a) of this section, by making the text of any written decision available to the public, and by publication of the decision one (1) time in the official newspaper of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 17, 11-1-93) 
Sec. 81/2-38. - Reduction of rates; prescription of rates.

Sec. 81/2-39. - Refunds. 
(a)  The city may order a cable operator to refund to subscribers that portion of previously paid rates determined by the city to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the rate charged as reasonable. Before ordering a cable operator to refund previously paid rates to subscribers, the city shall give the operator notice and opportunity to comment. The operator's opportunity to comment upon the proposed refunds may be at any meeting of the city council during the city's period of review of the operator's rates. If the city has extended its review period under section 81/2-33, and has issued an accounting order under section 81/2-33(e), then the operator, prior to refunds being ordered, may request an opportunity to appear before the city council to comment upon the proposed refunds. 
(b)  An operator's liability for refunds is limited to a one-year period, except that an operator that fails to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city shall be liable for refunds commencing from the effective date of such order until such time as it complies with such order. 
(c)  The refund period shall run as follows: 
(1)  From the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction back in time to September 1, 1993, or one (1) year, whichever is shorter. 
(2)  From the date the city issues an accounting order pursuant to section 81/2-33(d) hereof, and ending on the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction ordered by the city or one (1) year, whichever is shorter. 
(d)  The cable operator, in its discretion, may implement a refund in the following manner: 
(1)  By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid the overcharges, either through direct payment or as a specifically identified credit to those subscribers' bills; or 
(2)  By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment to cover the cumulative overcharge. This shall be reflected as a specifically identified, one-time credit on prospective bills to the class of subscribers that currently subscribe to the cable system. 
(e)  Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments. 
(Ord. No. 1797, § 19, 11-1-93)

(k)  The sale or transfer of any cemetery lot by any owner or purchaser, shall not be binding upon the cemetery unless same shall first be duly approved in writing by the properly authorized officer of the City of Waxahachie. This procedure is required in order that the cemetery may at all times have a complete and accurate record of all owners and purchasers.

Visitors and owners must not otherwise engage them. All orders, inquiries and complaints must be left at the office of the city secretary of the City of Waxahachie. 
(8)  All persons are reminded that the grounds are sacredly devoted to the burial of the dead and that the provisions and penalties of the law, as provided by statute, will be strictly enforced in all cases of wanton injury, disturbance, and disregard of the rules. 
(9)  It is of the utmost importance that there should be a strict observance of all the properties due the place, whether embraced in the foregoing regulations or not, as no impropriety will be tolerated. 
(10)  All well disposed persons will confer a favor by informing the cemetery of any breach of property decorum that may come under their notice.

(15)  Special cases may arise in which the literal enforcement of a rule may impose unnecessary hardship. The city, therefore, reserves the right, without notice, to make exceptions, suspensions, or modifications in any of the rules and regulations when, in its judgment, the same appear advisable and such temporary exceptions, suspensions, or modifications shall in no way be construed as affecting the general application of such. 
(w)  Addition Eleven to the city cemetery, in addition to the rules and regulations above stated, shall be subject to the following rules and regulations, with Addition Eleven being subject to the rules above stated where they do not conflict with the special rules for Addition Eleven, and subject also to the following rules, which are to control in case of any conflict: 
(1)  All gravespaces are to be physically marked before opening for interment by the cemetery sextant. 
(2)  Marker dimensions are to be no larger than twenty-eight (28) inches long by eighteen (18) inches wide by four (4) to six (6) inches thick. 
(3)  All markers must be set with concrete footing and placed such that the top surface of the marker is flush with the surrounding lawn. All markers must be previously approved by the cemetery sextant and the installation must meet strict specifications to be established by the city engineer. The cemetery sextant must be established by the city engineer.

(5)  All grading, landscape work and improvements of any kind, and all care on lots shall be done solely by the City of Waxahachie employees. The ownership of right of interment in lots does not confer any right to do planting on those lots. 
(6)  No cross-curbing of lots or covering of lots with concrete or ornamental materials of any type will be permitted. 
(7)  In order to properly maintain lawns, it is necessary that all grave decorations be limited to fresh cut-flowers, placed in approved sub-surface, permanent, cemetery vases. The following exceptions to this rule apply on special occasions only: 
Placement of artificial flowers, wreaths, pot plants, and baskets are permitted only on Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day and Memorial Day. Placement may be made during the week before and will be removed by the cemetery on the 8th day following the occasion, and disposed of. 
Christmas wreaths and pot plants may be placed on graves any time after the Friday before Thanksgiving and will be removed by the cemetery on or after January 15th. 
(8)  Due to the city's obligation to maintain the lawn throughout the grass growing season, digging holes in the ground or placing of rods or brackets to support top-heavy pots and containers at places of interment is not permitted at any time of year since there is danger of bodily injury to employees using power equipment or possible damage to expensive maintenance equipment. 
(9)  The cemetery reserves the right to reroute or remove roads in this addition without prior notice to lotholders.

Sec. 21-46. - Assault and battery-Definitions. 
    Assault shall be any attempt to commit a battery or any threatening gesture showing in itself or by words accompanying it, an immediate intention coupled with an ability to commit a battery. 
    Assault and battery shall be the use of unlawful violence on the person of another with intent to injure him, whatever be the means or the degree of violence used. 
    Coupled with an ability shall mean: 
(1)  That the person making the assault must be in such a position that, if not prevented, he may inflict a battery upon the person assaulted; and 
(2)  That he must be within such distance of the person so assaulted as to make it within his power to commit the battery by the use of the means with which he attempts it; 
(3)  It follows that one who is at the time of making an attempt to commit a battery under such restraint as to deprive him of the power to act, or who is so great a distance from the person assailed that he cannot reach his person by the use of the means with which he makes the attempt, is not guilty of an assault. But the use of any dangerous weapon, or the semblance thereof, in an angry or threatening manner, with intent to alarm another and under circumstances calculated to effect that object comes within the meaning of an assault. 
Sec. 21-47. - Same-Presumption of intent; "injury," scope of term. 
    When an injury is caused by violence to the person, the intent to injure is presumed, and it rests with the person inflicting the injury to show the accident or innocent intent. The injury intended may be either bodily pain, constraint or sense of shame or other disagreeable emotion of the mind. 
Sec. 21-48. - Same-Commission. 
    An assault or an assault and battery may be committed by the use of any part of the body of the person committing the offense, as of the hand, foot, head or by the use of any inanimate object, as a stick, knife or anything else capable of inflicting the slightest injury; or by the use of any animate object, as by throwing one person against another, or driving a horse or other animal against the person; or by any means used, as by spitting in the face or otherwise, which is capable of inflicting any injury; and may be committed though the person actually injured thereby was not the person intended to be injured. 
Sec. 21-49. - Same-Certain acts excluded; enumeration, limitation. 
    Violence to the person does not amount to an assault or battery in the following cases: 
(1)  In the exercise of the use of moderate restraint or correction given by law to the parent over the child, the guardian over the ward, the master over his apprentice, the teacher over the scholar; 
(2)  To preserve order in a meeting for religious, political or other lawful purposes; 
(3)  To preserve the peace or to prevent the commission of offenses; 
(4)  In preventing or interrupting an intrusion upon the lawful possession of property; 
(5)  In making a lawful arrest and detaining the party arrested, in obedience to the lawful order of a magistrate or court, and in overcoming resistance to such lawful order; 
(6)  The self-defense, or in defense of another against unlawful violence offered to his person or property; 
(7)  Where violence is permitted to effect a lawful purpose, only that degree of force must be used which is necessary to effect such purpose. 
Sec. 21-50. - Same-Verbal provocation. 
    No verbal provocation justifies an assault and battery, but insulting and abusive words may be given in mitigation of the punishment affixed to the offense.

Sec. 21-200. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the Waxahachie Smoke-Free Air Ordinance. 
( Ord. No. 2757, Exh. A, § 1000, 8-18-14 ) 
Sec. 21-201. - Findings and intent. 
    The City of Waxahachie does hereby find that: 
    The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's Report, The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, has concluded that (1) secondhand smoke exposure causes disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke; (2) children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks, and that smoking by parents causes respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their children; (3) exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer; (4) there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; (5) establishing smoke-free workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke exposure does not occur in the workplace, because ventilation and other air cleaning technologies cannot completely control for exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke; and (6) evidence from peer-reviewed studies shows that smoke-free policies and laws do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.) 
    The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2006. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of approximately 53,000 Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, August 1999.) A study of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in Helena, Montana before, during, and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce smoke free workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease. (Sargent, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M.; Glantz, Stanton A., "Reduced incidence of admissions for myocardial infarction associated with public smoking ban: before and after study," British Medical Journal 328: 977-980, April 24, 2004.) Similar studies have been conducted in numerous places, including Bowling Green, Ohio; Monroe County, Indiana; Pueblo, Colorado; New York State; France; Greece; Italy; and Scotland. All of these studies have reached the conclusion that communities see an immediate reduction in heart attack admissions after the implementation of comprehensive smoke free laws. ([n.a.], "Bibliography of Secondhand Smoke Studies." American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation, February 26, 2008.) In reviewing eleven (11) such studies, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies concluded that data consistently demonstrate that secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks and that smoke-free laws reduce heart attacks. (Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice, Committee on Secondhand Smoke Exposure and Acute Coronary Events, "Secondhand smoke exposure and cardiovascular effects: making sense of the evidence," Washington, DC: National Academies Press, October 2009.) 
    A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five (25) percent to fifty (50) percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 1(3): 220-225, September 2002.) Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) The Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9.) The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated with exposure to tobacco smoke is non-linear at low doses, increasing rapidly with relatively small doses such as those received from secondhand smoke or actively smoking one (1) or two (2) cigarettes a day, and has warned that all patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking. (Pechacek, Terry F.; Babb, Stephen, "Commentary: How acute and reversible are the cardiovascular risks of secondhand smoke?" British Medical Journal 328: 980-983, April 24, 2004.) Given the fact that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke-free environments. ASHRAE has determined that there is currently no air filtration or other ventilation technology that can completely eliminate all the carcinogenic components in secondhand smoke and the health risks caused by secondhand smoke exposure, and recommends that indoor environments be smoke-free in their entirety. (Samet, J.; Bohanon, Jr., H.R.; Coultas, D.B.; Houston, T.P.; Persily, A.K.; Schoen, L.J.; Spengler, J.; Callaway, C.A., "ASHRAE position document on environmental tobacco smoke," American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), 2005.) 
    Unregulated high-tech smoking devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes, or "e-cigarettes," closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine created by heat through an electronic ignition system. After testing a number of e-cigarettes from two (2) leading manufacturers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that various samples tested contained not only nicotine but also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals, including tobacco specific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical used in antifreeze. The FDA's testing also suggested that "quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or non-existent." ([n.a.], "Summary of results: laboratory analysis of electronic cigarettes conducted by FDA," Food and Drug Administration (FDA), July 22, 2009; http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm173146.htm Accessed on: October 22, 2009.) E-cigarettes produce a vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances, which may appear similar to the smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products. Their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions. 
    Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to businesses. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
    Accordingly, the City of Waxahachie finds and declares that the purposes of this ordinance are (1) to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and (2) to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air.

Sec. 28-26. - "C" street paving. 
(a)  "C" Street specifications. A type of paving to be known as "C" street paving shall be built to the following specifications: 
Existing roadway shall be scarified, bladed or otherwise manipulated to establish a good cross-section and a smooth profile, after lime stabilization. Lime will be applied to existing base material at a rate to generally achieve optimum unconfined shear strength. Lime treatment will be in general conformance with Item No. 260 "Lime Treatment for Materials in Place" of the latest "Texas Highway Department Standard Specifications for Construction of Highways, Streets and Bridges", hereinafter referred to as "Highway Department Specifications". After proper compaction and shaping, two (2) courses of asphaltic surface treatment will be applied in general conformance with Item No. 322 "Two Course Surface Treatment" of "Highway Department Specifications". Asphaltic material, either AC-5 or AC-10, will be applied in the following method and rates. The first course will be applied at a rate of between 0.2 of a gallon per square yard to 0.3 of a gallon per square yard and fully covered with aggregate. A second course will be applied at a rate of between 0.25 of a gallon per square yard to 0.35 of a gallon per square yard and fully covered with Type A Grade 4 or 5 aggregate as set out in Item No. 302 "Aggregate for Surface Treatments" of "Highway Department Specifications". 
Whenever possible, said paving is to be done with city equipment and personnel, rather than contracted out. 
(b)  Paving policy and procedure. It is policy of this city council to pave streets that have not been paved at all, or on which existing paving is seriously deteriorated, with "C" type street paving when funds are available to do said paving. The decision of when paving shall be done, and of which streets shall be paved, shall be the decision of the city council, which can be made by motion entered into the minutes of any city council meeting. Property owners or residents of homes abutting on a street needing paving may petition the city council to pave a designated street or portion of a street, and the city council will give due consideration to such requests, but reserves the right to designate such streets for paving as it believes to be in the public interest, including streets on which no petition is received. 
(c)  Payment for paving. Property owners of property abutting on a section of street shall be assessed a portion of the paving cost as follows: 
(1)  On streets on which the paved width is twenty-two (22) feet or less, two dollars ($2.00) per front foot shall be assessed to the owners of both sides of the street; 
(2)  On streets on which the paved width is over twenty-two (22) feet, but not more than twenty-six (26) feet, two dollars and twenty-five cents ($2.25) per front foot; 
(3)  On streets on which the paved width is over twenty-six (26) feet, two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per front foot. 
Streets shall be paved only when the owners of seventy-five (75) percent of the frontage to be paved have each paid at least fifty (50) percent of their assessment in cash, and signed proper, instruments to evidence the remaining part of their debt unless the city council makes a special exception by motion entered into the minutes of any council meeting.

If a person provides sufficient written information for the application of the line fee, grantee may bill the person on the basis of the information provided. Grantee shall provide to the city any information regarding the locations to which it is providing service or facilities for use by another person for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers, so long as city first obtains written permission of such other person for grantee to provide the information to the city.

(a)  Green indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
(2)  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(3)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in section 32-208, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(b)  Steady yellow indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 32-208, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(c)  Steady red indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. 
(2)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 32-208, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
    In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. 
Sec. 32-207. - Flashing signals. 
    Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows: 
Flashing red (stop) signal: When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
Flashing yellow (caution signal): When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through an intersection or past such signal only with caution.

(a)  Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles. 
(b)  Don't Walk or Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing on the "Walk" signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the "Don't Walk" or "Wait" signal is showing. 
Sec. 32-209. - When signals not operating. 
(a)  Whenever a traffic signal is out of order the driver of a vehicle approaching the area of control by the signal shall approach such area at a slow speed and stop if necessary and shall not proceed until reasonably certain that it is safe to do so. 
(b)  It shall be the duty of all persons knowing of any traffic signal or control device that is out of order, altered, defaced, removed or otherwise inoperative to report such condition to the police department.

Sec. 33-57. - Reporting requirements. 
(a)  Baseline monitoring reports. 
(1)  Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in subsection (a)(2), below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in subsection (a)(2), below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(2)  Users described above shall submit the information set forth below: 
a.  All information required in subsections 33-55(e)(1), 33-55(e)(2), 33-55(e)(3), and 33-55(e)(6). 
b.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The user shall provide the information in subsection 33-55(e)(7)a. through d. 
2.  The user shall take a minimum of one (1) representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection. 
3.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e), to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority. 
4.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with subsection (k) of this section. 
5.  The director may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
6.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
c.  Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
d.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection (b) of this section. 
e.  Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with subsection 33-55(f) of this article and signed by an authorized representative as defined in subsection 33-52(d). 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (a)(2)d. of this section: 
(1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
(2)  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months; 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the director no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the director. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in subsections 33-55(e)(6) and 33-55(e)(7) and subsection (a)(2)b. of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 33-55(f) of this article. 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users that are required to self-monitor, shall, at a frequency determined by the director, but in no case less than once every six (6) months (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 33-55(f) of this article. 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge, and in compliance with subsection (k) of this section. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (k) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change. 
(1)  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection 33-55(e) of this article. 
(2)  The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 33-55 of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection 33-56(d) of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty (20) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Reports and unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director as the director may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the director monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the director samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. If the city performs sampling in-lieu of the industrial user, the city will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the industrial user of the violation and requires the industrial user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than sixty (60) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (a), (c) and (d) of this section. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (i)(1) above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an appliance categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the director or other parties approved by EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsections (k)(2) and (k)(3), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports required in subsections (a) and (c) of this section, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by subsection (d) of this section, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under section 33-53. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City of Waxahachie, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-58. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Minimum requirement. The City of Waxahachie shall perform compliance monitoring (inspection and sampling) of the SIUs on a minimum of at least once a year. The director may increase the compliance monitoring events as needed. 
(b)  Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The director or other authorized agent(s) shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated a minimum of once per calendar year and certification of calibration submitted to the director to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the director or authorized agent(s), access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article, unless permittee shows reasonable proof for the delay. The burden of proof will rely on the permittee. 
(c)  Search warrants. If the director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City of Waxahachie designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Municipal Court of the City of Waxahachie. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-59. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained form reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the director's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-60. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The director shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including monthly average limits as defined in section 33-53; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement, including monthly average limits, as defined in section 33-53, multiplied by the applicable criteria (one and four-tenths (1.4)) for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and (one and two-tenths (1.2)) for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement, as defined in section 33-53 (monthly average limits, long-term average, or narrative standards) that the director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s) which may include a violation of best management practices which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-61. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the use to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The director may order a user that has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least five (5) working days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Recovery of costs. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article, the regulation, or rules of the city orders issued by the director, or orders of any court of competent jurisdiction, or who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit, obstruction, deterioration in effluent quality, or causes damage to or impairs the POTW(s) shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The city may order the person to clean up, repair, replace, and pay for any expenses, loss, or damages caused by the act of commission or omission by the user and bill the user for the costs incurred by the city for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed cost shall constitute a violation of this article enforceable under the provisions of this chapter, including the penalty provisions. Also, after notice to the user and failure of the user to pay or to perform as required by the city, the city may file suit in the appropriate court with jurisdiction in the amount of cost paid or incurred by the city and collect the amount as an itemized sworn account. The city may file such cost as a lien against the property. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed unnecessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections (c) or (h) of this section. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in subsection 33-56(f) of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 33-53 of this article. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection 33-56(c) of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-62. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the District Court for Ellis County through the City of Waxahachie's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City of Waxahachie for a maximum civil penalty of a maximum allowed under state law, but not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City of Waxahachie. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than maximum fine allowed under state law, but not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than the maximum time allowed under state law. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least the maximum fine allowable under state law, but not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than the maximum time allowed by state law. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than the maximum fine allowable under state law per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than the maximum allowed under state law. 
(4)  In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than the maximum fine allowable under state law per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than the maximum time allowed under state law or both. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City of Waxahachie's Enforcement Response Plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-63. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Performance bonds. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City of Waxahachie, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(b)  Liability insurance. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
(c)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(d)  Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the Waxahachie City Code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the City of Waxahachie for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. 
(e)  Informant rewards. The director may pay up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) for information leading to the discovery of noncompliance by a user. In the event that the information provided results in a civil penalty or an administrative fine levied against the user, the director may disperse up to one (1) percent of the collected fine or penalty to the informant. However, a single reward payment may not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(f)  Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the City of Waxahachie. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the City of Waxahachie held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the director. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-64. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Act of God. In an action brought in municipal or state court, if a person can establish that an event would otherwise be a violation of this article or a permit issued under this article was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, as defined in V.T.C.A., Water Code § 7.251, the event is not a violation of this article or the permit. In an enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. In the event that an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe has been established the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent possible until such time as the reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(b)  Upset. In an action brought in federal court, it is an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards that the noncompliance was caused by upset, as defined in the following subsections of this section. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (b)(3) below, are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(c)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 33-53(a)(1) of this article or the specific prohibitions in subsection 33-53(a)(2)c.-r. of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City of Waxahachie was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
Note: The references in subsection (c) should refer only to specific prohibitions actually listed in the ordinance. Also note that, pursuant to 40 CFR section 403.5(a)(2), the affirmative defense outlined in subsection (c) cannot apply to the specific prohibitions in subsections 33-53(a)(2)a. and b. 
(d)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. "Severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (d)(3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (d)(3) of this section. 
b.  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (d)(4)a. of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-65. - Wastewater treatment rates. 
    Fees shall be established for items such as treatment rates for wastewater discharged to the publicly owned-treatment works, permit fee, conventional pollutant surcharge fees, inspection fees and various other related fees. These fees will be included in chapter 33 of the City of Waxahachie Code of Ordinances, article II, Rates and Charges. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-66. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Pretreatment charges and fees. The City of Waxahachie shall adopt reasonable "schedules of fees" for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the City of Waxahachie's Pretreatment Program which may include: 
(1)  Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications, public notification fees; 
(2)  Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
(3)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  Fees for filing appeals; and 
(5)  Other fees as the City of Waxahachie may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and are separate from all other fees, fines and penalties chargeable by the City of Waxahachie. 
(b)  Severability. If any provision of this article is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be effected and shall continue in full force and effect. 
(c)  Conflict. That all ordinances of the City of Waxahachie heretofore adopted which are in conflict with the provisions of this article are hereby repealed. 
(Ord. No. 2568, 4-5-10; Ord. No. 2573, 7-19-10) 
Sec. 33-67. - Effective date. 
    This article shall be in full force and effect immediately upon the effective date found in the issued TPDES wastewater discharge permit to the City of Waxahachie which incorporates this approved article by reference.

(Ord. No. 1479, § 1, 8-19-85) 
Sec. 33-90. - Extension of water and sewer lines by developer. 
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of the developer of property in the City of Waxahachie to pay the total cost of installation of water and sewer extensions required to serve his development. The City of Waxahachie will, however, participate in the cost of the oversized water and sewer lines, as provided in this article, when funds are available. 
(b)  Construction plans for water and sewer extensions, including any offsite facilities which may be required shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer in the State of Texas and his seal shall be placed on each sheet. 
(c)  These construction plans shall be submitted and approved as part of the platting process, prior to commencement of construction of any line. 
(d)  The size and general location of water and sewer lines shall conform to the city's master plan for water and sewer facilities, or any revision thereof. The design and construction of water and sewer lines shall conform to the standards and specifications of the City of Waxahachie. The developer shall secure approval of the plans by the city engineer prior to entering into a contract for construction of improvements. 
(e)  The developer shall notify the city engineer at least seven (7) days prior to commencing construction so that adequate arrangements can be made for inspection of the facilities to be constructed. No construction shall be commenced until proof of insurance as required has been furnished to the city engineer. A one-year maintenance bond in favor of the City of Waxahachie, in the amount of ten (10) percent of the actual total contract cost, shall be furnished before final acceptance of the improvements constructed. If a developer's liability fee is desired by the developer, he shall submit a request to the city within thirty (30) days after final acceptance of the improvements constructed. 
(Ord. No. 1479, § 2, 8-19-85) 
Sec. 33-91. - Developer's liability fee. 
(a)  A fee, which shall be known as "developer's liability fee," may be established and applied to property abutting water or sewer lines constructed by a developer after the passage of this article. At such time as the abutting property is connected to the water and sewer system, this fee shall be collected from the property owner or developer of such property and used to reimburse the developer who constructed the water or sewer lines, if a contract is established for repayment and the time limit of the contract has not expired. 
(b)  To establish such a fee, the developer who installed the water or sewer lines shall make a timely request to the city engineer, in writing, that such a developer's liability fee be established. The request shall be accompanied by a copy of the construction contract and such other evidence as is necessary to establish the actual cost. 
(c)  The developer will be responsible for calculating the average cost of the line per foot of line which is to include fire hydrants, valves, fittings, manholes, and other appurtenances which were determined necessary for the construction of the line. 
(d)  The city engineer shall verify the developers calculations for the average cost; if there is any discrepancy, the city engineer shall establish the average cost for the developer liability fee for the entire line, lines or any part thereof. The fee may include engineering costs up to six (6) percent of the construction cost, which is to be added to the total to be reimbursed. 
(e)  The developer's liability fee shall be established as one-half (1/2) the average cost per foot of main abutting a line on each side of the line where it can be connected to, from both sides. Where a line can be connected to, from one side only, the property on that side shall be responsible for twice the developer's liability fee, or the average cost of the main per foot. 
(f)  The city shall collect the applicable developer's liability fee before connection of property adjacent to a water or sewer line for which there is an established developer's liability fee. This developer's liability fee will be reimbursed to the original developer under a contract for a period of up to and including ten (10) years from the date of city acceptance of the contract. After ten (10) years, fees shall be collected as pro rata fees and retained by the city. On all developer's liability fees returned to the original developer, the city shall deduct two (2) percent of the amount collected as a collection fee. 
(Ord. No. 1479, § 3, 8-19-85) 
Sec. 33-92. - Pro rate fee. 
(a)  A fee, which shall be known as "pro rata," shall be charged against each lot of tract of land, and the owner thereof, which abuts and connects to any existing water or sewer line. All property, and each side thereof, when property on each side can connect shall be responsible for one-half (1/2) the actual average per foot cost of a standard size line for each foot fronting such line. For lines installed which can be connected to, from one side only, the abutting property shall be responsible for the entire average per foot cost of such line fronting the connecting property. The following shall determine the pro rata fee: 
(1)  Where a developer's liability fee or other reimbursement contract does not exist, the following fees shall be used: 
a.  Eight dollars ($8.00) per abutting foot for each side of water lines. 
b.  Ten dollars ($10.00) per abutting foot for each side of sewer lines. 
[(2)  Reserved.] 
(b)  The City Council of the City of Waxahachie may change the above rates by resolution. Such changed rates will be placed on file with the city secretary. 
(c)  No connections are to be made until all real fees (pro rata, capital cost recovery, tapping fees, etc.) are paid. 
(Ord. No. 1479, § 4, 8-19-85) 
Sec. 33-93. - Oversize lines. 
(a)  Water and sewer lines twelve (12) inches in diameter and smaller are considered standard size. All water and sewer lines larger than twelve (12) inches in diameter shall be considered oversize. The city will reimburse the developer for installing an oversize line when the developer has been instructed by the city to install a line larger than the standard size and funds are available. This oversized participation shall include valves, fittings, manholes and other appurtenances and shall include the cost of such oversize appurtenances. 
(b)  The added cost of increasing the size of line shall be determined by the city engineer by comparing actual contract costs, or costs included in contracts for similar projects. 
(Ord. No. 1479, § 5, 8-19-85)

Sec. 33-153. - Impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  Maximum impact fees per service unit for each service area shall be established by category of capital improvements. The maximum impact fee per service unit for each service area for each category of capital improvement shall be computed in the following manner: 
(1)  Calculate the total projected costs of capital improvements necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area identified in the impact fee capital improvements plan for each category of capital improvements; 
(2)  From such amount, subtract a credit equal to fifty (50) percent of the such total projected costs; and 
(3)  Divide the resultant amount by the total number of service units anticipated within the service area, based upon the land use assumptions for that service area. 
(b)  The impact fee per service unit which is to be paid by each new development within a service area shall be that established by ordinance by the city council, as such may be amended from time to time, and shall be an amount less than or equal to the maximum impact fee per service unit established in subsection (a). 
(c)  The amount of the impact fees to be assessed per service unit shall be as set forth in Schedule 1, attached hereto and made a part of this article by reference. The amount of the impact fees per service unit which are to be paid shall be as set forth in Schedule 2 attached hereto and made a part of this article by reference. The amount of the impact fees to be collected per service unit may be phased over a period of years, such amount to be set forth by year in Schedule 2. Schedules 1 and 2 may be amended from time to time utilizing the amendment procedure set forth in section 33-162.

(e)  The maximum impact fee per service unit for system facilities, as may be amended from time to time, hereby is declared to be an approximate and appropriate measure of the impacts generated by a new unit of development on the city's system facilities. To the extent that the impact fee charged against a new development, as may be amended from time to time, is less than the maximum impact fee per service unit, such difference hereby is declared to be founded on policies unrelated to measurement of the impacts of the new development on the city's system facilities. The maximum impact fee rate may be used in evaluating any claim by a property owner that the dedication or construction of a capital improvement imposed as a condition of development approval pursuant to the city's subdivision or development regulations is disproportionate to the impacts created by the development on the city's system facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2092, 8-20-01; Ord. No. 2494, 1c., 11-17-08; Ord. No. 2725 , § 1c., 10-21-13)

For a new development that received final plat approval on or after the effective date of the ordinance establishing roadway impact fees, assessment of roadway impact fees shall be as provided in subsection (2). 
(b)  Following assessment of the impact fee pursuant to subsection (a), the amount of the impact fee assessment per service unit for that development cannot be increased, unless the owner proposes to change the approved development by the submission of a new application for final plat approval that results in approval of additional service units, in which case a new assessment shall occur at the schedule 1 rate then in effect for such additional service units. 
(c)  Following the vacating of any plat or submittal of any replat, a new assessment must be made in accordance with section 33-154(a)(2).

(b)  The impact fees to be paid and collected shall be the amount per service unit listed in Schedule 2. The city may enter into an agreement with a developer for a different time and manner of payment of impact fees, in which case the agreement shall determine the time and manner of payment. 
(c)  The city shall compute the impact fees for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The amount of each impact fee shall be determined by multiplying the number of service units generated by the new development by the impact fee per service unit for the service area using Schedule 2. The number of service units shall be determined by using the land equivalency table (exhibit 1). 
(2)  The amount of each impact fee shall be reduced by any allowable offsets or credits for that category of capital improvements, in the manner provided in section 33-156. 
(3)  The total amount of the impact fees for the new development shall be calculated and attached to the development application or request for connection as a condition of approval. 
(d)  The amount of each impact fee for a new development shall not exceed an amount computed by multiplying the fee assessed per service unit pursuant to section 33-153 by the number of service units generated by the development.

(1)  No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  No offset shall exceed an amount equal to the eligible costs of the improvement multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the impact fee per service unit due for the new development as computed using Schedule 2 and the denominator of which is the maximum impact fee per service unit for the new development as computed using Schedule 1. 
(3)  The unit costs used to calculate offsets and credits shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the impact fees capital improvements plan for the category of facility for which the impact fee is imposed, nor shall the amount of the offset or credit exceed the actual costs of constructing a capital improvement. 
(4)  No offset or credit shall be given for an oversized facility which is not identified within the applicable impact fees capital improvements plan, unless the city agrees that such improvement supplies capacity to new developments other than the development paying the impact fee and provisions for offsets or credits are incorporated in an agreement for capital improvements pursuant to section 33-164. For roadway facilities, the costs of any roadway improvement not included within the roadway improvements plan or the master thoroughfare plan are not eligible for offsets or credits. 
(5)  In no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer for an offset or credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to these impact fee regulations or for any amount exceeding the total impact fees due for the development for that category of capital improvements, unless expressly agreed to by the city in writing. 
(6)  Offsets or credits for system facilities dedicated to and accepted by the city for a development prior to the effective date of this article shall be prorated among the total number of service units within such development and reduced by an amount equivalent to the number of existing service units within such development and shall be further reduced by the amount of any participation funds received from the city and by any payments received from other developments who utilize the system facility. 
(7)  The city may participate in the costs of a system improvement to be dedicated to the city, including costs that exceed the amount of the impact fees due for the development under Schedule 1 for that category of capital improvements, in accordance with policies and rules established under the city's subdivision regulations. The amount of any offset shall not include the amount of the city's participation. 
(c)  Offsets or credits created after the effective date of an ordinance establishing an impact fee for a particular category of capital improvement shall expire within ten (10) years from the date the offset or credit was created. Offsets or credits arising prior to such effective date shall expire ten (10) years from such effective date. Credits for construction of improvements shall be deemed created when the improvements are completed and the city has accepted the facility, or in the case of improvements constructed and accepted prior to the effective date of the ordinance establishing the impact fee for a particular category of capital improvements, on such effective date. 
(d)  Unless an agreement for credits under section 33-164 is executed providing for a different manner or applying credits against impact fees due, an offset or credit associated with a plat shall be applied to reduce an impact fee at the time of application for the first building permit or at the time of application for the first utility connection for the property, in the case of land located within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, and, thereafter, to all subsequently issued building permits or utility connections, until the offset or credit is exhausted. 
(e)  A developer or owner of a master planned project, including a subdivision containing multiple phases, and whether approved before or after the effective date of an ordinance establishing an impact fee for the category of capital improvements for which an offset or credit is claimed, may apply for offsets or credits against impact fees for the entire project based upon contributions of land, improvements or funds for system facilities, or other capital improvements supplying excess capacity. Credits shall be determined by comparing capacity supplied or to be supplied by the project with capacity to be consumed by development within the project, utilizing a methodology approved by the city. The determination shall be incorporated within an agreement for credits, in accordance with section 33-164.

(2)  For a new development utilizing a water meter that is greater than two (2) inches in size, the city may reduce impact fees due by an amount not to exceed twenty-five (25) percent. 
(b)  To encourage affordable housing, the city shall refund eighty (80) percent of impact fees paid by a builder for construction of a new single-family dwelling that is subsequently purchased by any household with household income of eighty (80) percent or less of the household median income for Ellis County, Texas, upon written application of the builder, which application shall be presented to the city within three (3) months of the original date of purchase by the homeowner. 
(c)  No water impact fee shall be charged for a 3/4-inch by 5/8 -inch displacement type water meter devoted exclusively to irrigation purposes to serve a single-family dwelling.

(e)  The Waxahachie Independent School District shall pay only thirty (30) percent of the full impact fee rate charged by the city. The percentage paid shall be reviewed annually. 
    The rate paid shall be calculated so that the estimated percentage of residents living outside the city limits but within the WISD boundary is the percentage to be paid. It is presently calculated and agreed that the thirty (30) percent of the full impact fee rate paid by the school district compensates for the estimated thirty (30) percent of those residents that live outside of the Waxahachie city limits but within the WISD boundary. 
    This calculation is currently based on voter registration records. If more accurate population projection information becomes available, that information will be used to recalculate the formula. The city staff shall consult with school officials on any recalculation, but the decision of the city staff is binding. The current calculation shall govern until such recalculation is made. 
(f)  Pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 395.022, as amended, a school district is not required to pay impact fees imposed under this article unless the board of trustees of the district consents to the payment of the fees by entering a contract with the city imposing the fees. 
(g)  An exception is provided for "infill construction" of new construction within the areas provided in Ordinance No. 2596. The areas provided for in said Ordinance No. 2596 are exempt from impact fees, except that multifamily, commercial or industrial uses in buildings of eight thousand (8,000) square feet or more shall still be subject to all impact fees. 
    An emergency is declared to exist affecting the public health and safety, as this subsection (g) is needed to encourage construction of new improvements in the "infill" areas in older areas of town, which will encourage the cleaning up and use of vacant lots for new buildings in the older areas of town.

(b)  Except as herein otherwise provided, the assessment and collection of an impact fee shall be additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other tax, fee, charge or assessment which is lawfully imposed on and due against the property. 
(c)  The city council may decide that the city shall pay all or a part of impact fees due for a new development pursuant to duly adopted criteria. 
(Ord. No. 2092, 8-20-01)

(b)  This article shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density of development, design, and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of public improvements subject to the zoning and subdivision regulations or other regulations of the city, which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development. 
Sec. 33-168. - Relief procedures. 
(a)  Any person who has paid an impact fee or an owner of land upon which an impact fee has been paid may petition the city council to determine whether any duty required by this article has not been performed within the time so prescribed. The petition shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the unperformed duty and request that the duty be performed within sixty (60) days of the request. If the city council determines that the duty is required pursuant to the ordinance and is late in being performed, it shall cause the duty to commence within sixty (60) days of the date of the request and to continue until completion. This subsection is not applicable to matters which may be appealed pursuant to section 33-159. 
(b)  The city council may grant a variance from any requirement of this article, upon written request by a developer or owner of property subject to the article, following a public hearing, and only upon finding that a strict application of such requirement would, when regarded as a whole, result in confiscation of the property.

( Ord. No. 2740, § 1(Exh. A, § VII), 4-21-14 ) 
Sec. 33-328. - Triggering criteria for initiation and termination of drought response stages. 
    The city manager, or his/her designee, shall monitor water supply and/or demand conditions on a daily basis and shall determine when conditions warrant initiation or termination of each stage of the plan. Public notification of the initiation or termination of drought response stages shall be by means such as publication in the local newspapers, announcements on local radio station, publication at city hall, social media and the city website. 
    The triggering criteria described below are based on previous experiences in drought conditions in the City of Waxahachie over the past thirty (30) years. Until 1994 the city did not have an established drought contingency plan and there has been sufficient water to serve the city. However, since the city has been and continues to be experiencing moderate growth over the past years, there is a need to revise drought contingency measures to protect the city's water supplies as well as meet the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's Regulations. The following triggering criteria have been established based on the past five (5) years (2009-2013) experience of moderate to severe drought conditions. These measures, coupled with the improvements of the Bardwell Reservoir Raw Water Pump Station and construction of the new Robert W. Sokoll Joint-Venture Surface Water Treatment Plant, enabled the City of Waxahachie to maintain an adequate supply of water during these dry times. The basis for determining the drought stages is based on the available water supply in Lake Waxahachie.

Sec. 33-452. - Raw water supply, service area and system information. 
    The City of Waxahachie diverts its primary raw water source from Lake Waxahachie. The surface water reservoir is located on South Prong Creek of the Trinity River Basin in Ellis County, in the southern section of the City of Waxahachie approximately four (4) miles from the downtown district. The drainage area for Lake Waxahachie is approximately thirty (30) square miles. The Ellis County Water Control and Improvement District No. 1 (District) was issued Water Rights Permit No. 1742 on March 14, 1955 from the Board of Water Engineers and a Certificate of Adjudication No. 08-5018 on May 5, 1987 from the Texas Water Commission. The permit and adjudication authorizes the district to impound thirteen thousand five hundred (13,500) acre-feet of water with permission to use three thousand five hundred seventy (3,570) acre-feet of water annually for municipal purposes. The City of Waxahachie operates and maintains the reservoir, dam, two (2) raw water pump stations, raw water pipe lines and the surface water treatment plant for the district. 
    The district also holds Certificate of Adjudication No. 08-5021A for diversion of raw water from Bardwell Reservoir in the amount not to exceed four thousand three hundred twenty (4,320) acre-feet of water per annum. In addition, the district holds Certificate of Adjudication No. 08-5021C, issued February 6, 1998. This certificated allows for a maximum of sixty-five (65) percent of the maximum amount of water authorized for diversion by the District for re-use. This is sixty-five (65) percent of the total of four thousand three hundred twenty (4,320) acre-feet and three thousand five hundred seventy (3,570) acre-feet from Bardwell Reservoir and Lake Waxahachie respectively that is discharge back into Waxahachie Creek from the City of Waxahachie's wastewater treatment plant located approximately nine (9) miles upstream from the upper end of the conservation pool of Bardwell Reservoir. This sixty-five (65) percent equates to an additional five thousand one hundred twenty-eight and one-half (5,128.5) acre-feet of water per annum that can be diverted for use from Bardwell Reservoir. 
    On December 4, 1991 the district contracted with the Trinity River Authority (TRA), as a party of the Ellis County Regional Water Supply Project Contract, for the right to purchase and divert, an average annual quantity of 2.150 mgd raw water from the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One's (now Tarrant Regional Water District, TRWD) pipeline which conveys raw water from Richland Chambers and Cedar Creek Reservoirs. In the fall of 1999 the district contracted with the Trinity River Authority for the purchase of an additional 2.500 mgd of raw water. The district currently has contracted for 4.65 mgd annual average quantity of raw water through TRA from the TRWD pipelines. 
    The district has no employees and is a board appointed by the City of Waxahachie City Council for the sole purpose of securing and financing water rights and water infrastructure to support the City of Waxahachie water customers. For the purpose of this plan the district and the City of Waxahachie are the same entity. 
    The City of Waxahachie is located in central Ellis County and encompass approximately forty-eight (48) square miles. The city currently has a customer base of approximately fourteen thousand one hundred one (14,101) connections with approximately seventy (70) percent single-family residential, eleven (11) percent commercial and one (1) percent industrial and serves approximately thirty-one thousand seven hundred thirty-one (31,731) people within the city. The City of Waxahachie's water supply sources are from Lake Waxahachie, Bardwell Reservoir, Cedar Creek and Richland Chambers Reservoirs. The City of Waxahachie water use over the past three (3) years averages approximately 5.90 mgd with a peak of approximately ten (10.0) mgd. 
    The City of Waxahachie has an established sanitary sewer collection and treatment system with approximately two hundred forty-five (245) miles of collection lines. The collected wastewater is treated by an activated sludge biological treatment process utilizing an ultraviolet light disinfection process with the effluent being returned back to Waxahachie Creek, thence to Bardwell Reservoir. The City of Waxahachie's wastewater treatment plant is currently rated at eight (8) mgd annual average. Additional information is contained in the City's Utility Profile for Retail Water Supplier, Appendix "A". 
    The City of Waxahachie's Water Supply System consists of the following: 
Raw Water 
Raw water supply is primarily from Lake Waxahachie and is pumped through one (1) of the two (2) raw water pump stations located on the lake. As the water elevation in Lake Waxahachie decline, raw water is pumped from Bardwell Reservoir to Lake Waxahachie to help manage available water storage. Bardwell Reservoir has one (1) pump station with three (3) submersible pumps rated at six million (6,000,000) gallons per day each with a firm pumping capacity of twelve (12.0) mgd and two (2) parallel raw water lines, a twenty- and twenty-seven-inch diameter lines. Raw water is either pumped directly into Lake Waxahachie or on an emergency situation it may be pumped directly to the City of Waxahachie Surface Water Treatment Plant through the smaller raw water pump station located at Lake Waxahachie. There are two (2) raw water pump stations located at Lake Waxahachie. Raw Water Pump Station Number 1 has a firm pumping capacity of seven (7.0) mgd (with the largest pump out of service). Raw Water Pump Station No. 2 has a firm pumping capacity of eighteen (18.0) MGD (with the largest pump out of service). Raw water is pumped through parallel twenty-inch raw water pipelines from Lake Waxahachie to the surface water treatment plant. These pipelines together have a rated capacity of eighteen (18.0) MGD. 
Water Treatment 
The City of Waxahachie has one (1) conventional surface water treatment plant is currently rated at 18.7 mgd treatment capacity and fifteen (15) mgd high service pumping capacity. There are three (3) clearwells within the plant site with a total treated water storage capacity of four and one-half million (4,500,000) gallons. The plant is located at 1900 Howard Road in the southern part of the city. The surface water treatment plant has been participating in the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's Texas Optimization Program, since 1999. 
August 16, 2006 the City of Waxahachie executed a contractual Agreement with Rockett Special Utility District to form the Robert W. Sokoll Joint Venture partnership to construct the Robert W. Sokoll Surface Water Treatment Plant. The plant was commissioned in December 2009 with a treatment capacity of twenty (20.0) mgd. The plant receives its' raw water from the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) pipelines. The City of Waxahachie is co-owner of the treatment plant which utilizes microfiltration membrane treatment process. The treatment processes includes pre-disinfection, coagulation, sedimentation, granular activated carbon for taste and odor and iron and manganese removal, immersed microfiltration, on-site chlorine generation, vu/peroxide for enhanced taste and odor control and a four million (4,000,000) gallon clearwell. The City of Waxahachie has a high service pump station at the plant with a firm pumping capacity eleven (11.00) mgd. 
Treated Water Storage and Distribution Systems 
The treated water storage in the distribution system consist of three (3) ground storage reservoirs with a storage capacity total of three and one-half million (3,500,000) gallons. In addition, there are three (3) elevated storage tanks with a storage capacity of five million (5,000,000) gallons. 
    The City of Waxahachie's water distribution system has approximately two hundred one (201) miles of water distribution mains ranging in size from two-inch in diameter through twenty-four-inch diameter and over one thousand three hundred fifty (1,350) fire hydrants.

DIVISION 2. - WATER CONSERVATION PLAN 

Sec. 33-471. - Quantified five- and ten-year conservation goals. 
    The objective of the City of Waxahachie's Water Conservation Plan is to: (1) Establish water conservation strategies to achieve efficient use of water and reduce the gallons per capita per day (gpcd) consumption of water to meet specified goals. (2) Establish a program to reduce unaccounted-for water in the system and improve the quality of data in water loss estimates expressed in percentage and gpcd to meet specific and quantified goals. The City of Waxahachie is a municipal water supplier with approximately ten (10) major industrial water users, numerous commercial establishments, and continues to experience strong residential and economic growth. The total gallon per capita per day (GPCD) water use for the calendar year 2013 was one hundred eighty-two (182) gpcd, which is not excessive considering there are several major industrial water users in the city and their respective water uses are included in this gpcd calculation. The residential water use for 2013 year was one hundred ten (110) gpcd and the water loss was eighteen (18) gpcd. The gpcd's are not excessive as compared to industry standards, however there is still a need to reduce the water use to provide a more sustainable water supply during drought times. In the calendar year 2013 the City of Waxahachie used a total of 2,111,859,000 gallons of water, with the city's population estimate of thirty-one thousand seven hundred thirty-one (31,731).

_____
    The city has set a goal for the maximum unaccounted for water loss in the system to be no greater than eleven (11) percent for the next five (5) years and no greater than eleven (11) percent by 2024. This goal is generally recognized in the utility profession as an acceptable level of unaccounted for water loss. The un-accounted for water for 2013 for the City of Waxahachie was ten (10) percent, with the previous three (3) years ranging from ten (10) to twelve (12) percent and 2009 was at seventeen (17) percent unaccounted for. 
( Ord. No. 2742, Exh. A § II(A), 5-5-14 ) 
Sec. 33-472. - City of Waxahachie Water Conservation Program. 
    Some of the benefits that can be attributed to water conservation would be: extending the life of existing facilities and water supplies; delayed costs for purchase of additional water rights and infrastructure improvements such as pipelines, pump station, water storage facilities, plant expansions. Other benefits could include lower capital and operating cost such as electrical and treatment chemical. Water pressures in localized areas of the system would be lowered due to reduced pumping durations which in turn could reduce water leaks within the aging infrastructure. 
    The City of Waxahachie currently has several water conservation strategies in place: 
  Non-promotional water rate structure - the City of Waxahachie has a conservation oriented rate structure. The existing rates have a five-tier increasing block structure where customers are billed a higher rate as water usage increases. 
  Water conserving plumbing - the City of Waxahachie adopted the International Plumbing Code and updates to the code as they are published. The latest code adopted is the 2006 code and requires water conserving plumbing fixtures in all new applications and remodeled applications. 
  Direct re-use of the city's wastewater treatment effluent for in-plant wastewater operations and basin wash downs. 
  Water conservation brochures - brochures are available and distributed at city hall in the water billing and utility administration departments as well as at the Chamber of Commerce Office and at the Public Library. Conservation information is published in the city's annual Water Quality Report (CCR). 
  Public speaking events - city staff provide information through speaking engagements at civic organizations, schools, local media, and in-house engagements where water conservation ideas and information are discussed. 
  Leak detection program in areas of suspected water leaks based on historical data. 
  Water pressure reduction is implemented in areas of the city where system pressures exceed eighty-five (85) psi. 
  Through the city landscape ordinances requirement for all new automatic sprinkler systems to be equipped with rain and freeze sensors to prevent irrigation systems to operate during rain events and freezing temperatures. 
  Real water losses are minimized by replacement of deteriorating water mains and appurtenances on an on-going basis. 
  Real water losses are identified and corrected. 
  The water conservation plan and information is available on the city web site at www.waxahachie.com. 
    Proposed water conservation strategies to be implemented by the City of Waxahachie; 
  Water audits on all municipal operations and departments of water use habits. Information will be used to help train and re-train City of Waxahachie staff to be leaders in water conservation habits. 
  Perform water audits at the major industrial water users. 
  Review and update if needed, the City of Waxahachie required landscape ordinance to include and promote more water conservation information and strategies for all new development. 
  Prohibition of irrigation between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. from June 1 through September 31 of any year (except irrigation by hand and the use of soaker hoses). 
  Increase leak detection programs to include a more comprehensive and expanded areas of leak detection with in-house electronic equipment. 
  Expand the current public education program to include more speaking engagements with handouts, utilize the local news and social media for publication of conservation articles, etc. 
( Ord. No. 2742, Exh. A § II(B), 5-5-14 ) 
Sec. 33-473. - Conservation education and information. 
    The City of Waxahachie will periodically provide it's customers with literature on conservation measurers. These educational materials are available through the Texas Water Development Board, American Water Works Association, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and other such agencies. There are various forms of educational information for use such as door-to-door handouts, mail-outs, or information that will be added to the water bill at least once per year and made available to each new customer when they apply for water service. As noted earlier, the City of Waxahachie will publish conservation newspaper articles in the local newspapers periodically. City of Waxahachie representatives will be available to present water conservation programs to local schools, civic organizations and other groups. 
( Ord. No. 2742, Exh. A § II(C), 5-5-14 ) 
Sec. 33-474. - Source water and wholesale water metering. 
    The City of Waxahachie electronically meters the raw water diverted from Lake Waxahachie, Bardwell Reservoir and the Tarrant Regional Water District. Wholesale water is electronically metered at the point of connection to the city water distribution system. Raw water diverted from Bardwell Reservoir is metered at the raw water pump station located at Bardwell Reservoir, while raw water flows from Lake Waxahachie are metered at the surface water treatment plant from the two (2) raw water lines entering the plant. Raw water diversion from Tarrant Regional Water District pipeline for the Robert W. Sokoll WTP is metered near the connection point of the raw water line. These readings are electronically telemetered to the SCADA system operated by the City of Waxahachie at the city's water treatment plant and the Sokoll WTP. The master meter calibrations are performed at least annually and more frequently if needed, by an outside firm specializing in this type of work with copies of the calibration log sheets maintained by the utility department. The source water meters will be maintained within a plus/minus one and one-half (1.5) percent of one hundred (100) percent accuracy. 
    At least annually, surveillance of the raw water transmission line routes from Bardwell Reservoir, Lake Waxahachie and TRWD pipeline are made to check for leaks that may be present. Repairs are performed in a timely manner. 
( Ord. No. 2742, Exh. A § II(D), 5-5-14 ) 
Sec. 33-475. - Monitoring and records management program. 
    City of Waxahachie representatives track the usage daily from the SCADA system and a monthly report is generated from this information for monthly accounting purpose. The pumpage records are complied daily, monthly and annually on spreadsheets which are reviewed daily by the City of Waxahachie representatives, and are used to compile annual reports required by state agencies. 
    The water records include: 
  raw water diversion from each source 
  raw water into the surface water treatment plants 
  sludge blow down waters 
  backwash recycle waters 
  treated water pumped to the distribution system 
  water pumped into each service area 
  water sold by user classifications 
º  single-family residential 
º  commercial 
º  industrial 
º  multi-family residential 
º  institutional 
º  wholesale water 
  total water sold 
  water metered but not billed 
  miscellaneous accounted for water 
    Miscellaneous accounted for water includes such categories as tank overflows, water leak repairs summary reports, fire hydrant flushing, etc. From these records, the City of Waxahachie tracks on a monthly basis the raw water diverted in acre/feet and mgd. The un-accounted for water loss is compiled and reviewed on an annual basis. 
( Ord. No. 2742, Exh. A § II(E), 5-5-14 ) 
Sec. 33-476. - Metering leak detection and repair program. 
    Master metering of the raw water diverted, water pumped to the distribution system from the water treatment plant, water pumped to the upper pressure plane, and individual metering of all retail users provide an accurate accounting of water uses throughout the system. All water connections to the distribution system are metered, including temporary and construction services as well as all municipal facilities. Metering and meter repair and replacement, coupled with an annual water audit, are used in conjunction with other programs such as leak detection and repairs to save significant quantities of water. 
    The City of Waxahachie utilizes various methods for leak detection such as, customer notification of waterline leaks, detection by utility personnel while reading meters, maintaining the water systems, acoustical leak detection program and while performing other routine surveillance programs. Additionally, water audits are utilized to help determine if leaks exist which may have gone undetected. 
    The City of Waxahachie tests retail water meters as follows: 
  Master meters three-inch in diameter and larger, tested once per year 
  A representative number of one and one-half- to two-inch and the smaller residential meters are tested annually. 
  Residential water meters, tested as per AWWA recommendations found in Standard C700 and AWWA M6, Water Meters - Selection, Installation, Testing and Maintenance Manual. 
    Meters that are found to be non-registering are replaced immediately. A water meter replacement program is in place for residential meters whereby the existing meters are replaced once the meter has registered one million (1,000,000) gallons of water. All retail meters in the City of Waxahachie are read monthly and periodic inspections are made of services that are not currently in use to determine if illegal connections have been made. The meter department and utility personnel check abandoned services periodically for illegal use. 
( Ord. No. 2742, Exh. A § II(F), 5-5-14 ) 
Sec. 33-477. - Non-promotional water rate structure.

(2)  Stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants. 
(3)  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. 
(b)  The city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters in the city to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. 
(c)  It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety. 
(Ord. No. 2837 , Exh. A, 12-7-15) 
Sec. 33-697. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within the city. This division seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  To minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development or redevelopment in order to reduce flooding, siltation and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels; 
(2)  To minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development or redevelopment to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic conditions to the maximum extent practicable; 
(3)  To accommodate new development and redevelopment projects in a manner that protects public safety, groundwater and surface water quality and aquatic living resources and their habitats; 
(4)  To employ permanent nonstructural and structural best management practices (BMPs) to protect water quality thereby raising public awareness to stormwater quality related issues; 
(5)  To remove and/or treat stormwater pollutants prior to discharge to ground and surface waters throughout the city; 
(6)  To ensure the long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater quality features; and 
(7)  To reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, to the waters of the state through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to the public.

(1)  Maximum use shall be made of vegetation to minimize soil loss. 
(2)  Natural vegetation should be retained wherever possible. 
(3)  Where inadequate natural vegetation exists, or where it becomes necessary to remove existing natural vegetation, temporary controls should be installed promptly to minimize soil loss and ensure that erosion and sedimentation does not occur. 
(4)  Wherever possible during construction, erosion and sedimentation controls shall be used on hillsides to slow drainage flow rate. 
(5)  Erosion and sedimentation control elements should be implemented as soon as practical in the development process. Erosion and sedimentation controls shall be maintained by the responsible party. Erosion and sedimentation controls that are installed but not properly maintained in accordance with the erosion control manual shall be considered a violation of this division. 
(6)  Waste or disposal areas and construction roads should be located and constructed in a manner that will minimize the amount of sediment entering streams. 
(7)  Frequent fording of live streams will not be permitted; therefore, temporary bridges or other structures shall be used wherever an appreciable number of stream crossings are necessary. 
(8)  When work areas or material sources are located in or adjacent to live streams, such areas shall be separated from the stream by a dike or other barrier to keep sediment from entering a flowing stream. Care shall be taken during the construction and removal of such barriers to minimize the sediment transport into a stream. 
(9)  Should preventative measures fail to function effectively, the applicant shall act immediately to bring the erosion and/or siltation under control by whatever additional means are necessary. 
(10)  Erosion control devices shall be placed to trap any losses from stockpiled topsoil. 
(11)  The selection and timing of the installation of erosion controls shall be based upon weather and seasonal conditions that could make certain controls not practicable. 
(12)  Vegetation used for vegetative cover shall be suitable for local soil and weather conditions. Groundcover plants shall comply with listings from the Texas Agricultural Extension Service for North Central Texas. 
(13)  Runoff shall be diverted away from construction areas as much as possible. 
(14)  Stripping of vegetation from project sites shall be phased so as to expose the minimum amount of area to soil erosion for the shortest possible period of time. Phasing shall also consider the varying requirements of an erosion control plan at different stages of construction. 
(15)  Developers, builders or owners of property shall install all utilities, including franchise utilities, before final acceptance of a subdivision, property and/or structure. Final acceptance will also be contingent upon having all necessary erosion control measures installed to minimize off-site sediment. A site may be accepted without erosion control measures if perennial vegetative cover is actively growing at the discretion of the director of public works.

3)  That literal interpretation of the Ordinance will deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the Ordinance; 
4)  That the proposed variance is in harmony with the Ordinance's general purpose and intent; 
5)  That the granting of the variance will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant; 
6)  That the granting of the variance will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship or difficulty for the applicant; 
7)  That granting the variance will not confer upon the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the Ordinance to other similarly-situated properties in the same district; 
8)  That the variance is in the public interest and will ensure that public substantial justice will be done; 
9)  That the surrounding property will be properly protected; and 
10)  That remaining regulations are adequate to govern the project. 
(ii)  A variance shall not be granted to relieve a self-created or personal hardship, nor shall it be based solely on economic gain or loss, nor shall it permit any person a privilege in developing a parcel of land not permitted by this Ordinance to other parcels of land in the particular zoning district. No variance may be granted which results in undue hardship on another parcel of land. 
(iii)  The applicant bears the burden of proof in establishing the facts justifying a variance. 
(iv)  The Board does not have appellate authority over subdivision plat approval and cannot authorize a variance to provisions required in the City's Subdivision Ordinance. 
(f)  Nonconforming Uses and Structures : 
(i)  The Board shall have the authority to authorize the expansion or enlargement of a nonconformity, when such an expansion, enlargement or alteration will not prolong the life of the nonconformity. Upon review of the facts, the Board may establish a specific period of time for the occupancy to revert to a conforming use; and 
(ii)  To authorize the reconstruction and occupancy of a nonconforming structure, where such structure has been damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of more than sixty (60) percent, but less than the total, of the replacement cost of the structure on the date of the damage. Such action by the Board shall have due regard for the property rights of the person or persons affected, and shall be considered in regard to the public welfare, character of the area surrounding such structure, and the conservation, preservation and protection of property; and 
(iii)  To authorize the occupancy of an abandoned nonconforming structure. Such action by the Board shall have due regard for the property rights of the person or persons affected, and shall be considered in regard to the public welfare and safety, character of the area surrounding such structure, and the conservation, preservation and protection of property. 
(g)  Procedures : 
(i)  Application and Fee. An application for granting a variance or special exception by the Board , other than an appeal, shall be in writing using forms provided by the City and shall be accompanied by a fee, which amount shall be set by a separate Ordinance. 
1)  The application must provide a level of detail that allows the Board to make a determination on each item listed in Section 2.03(e). 
2)  The level of detail must demonstrate that a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. The application must show that the hardship is: 
a)  Unique, oppressive, not common to other property, and not against the public interest; 
b)  Not merely that the property cannot be utilized for its highest and best use; 
c)  Not merely financial; 
d)  Not self-imposed; and 
e)  Not simply a hindrance to the developer's goals. 
(ii)  Notice and Hearing. The Board shall hold a public hearing no later than forty-five (45) days after the date the application for action or an appeal is filed.

The officer to whom the appeal is made shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record of the action that is appealed. 
3)  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is appealed unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certified in writing to the Board that facts supporting the official's opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the Board or a court of record on application, after notice to the official, if due cause is shown. 
4)  The appellant party may appear at the appeal hearing in person or by agent or attorney. 
5)  The Board shall decide the appeal within four (4) weeks after placement on its agenda. If, after the four-week period has elapsed, no action has been taken by the Board on the appeal, the request shall be deemed automatically approved. The Board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the administrative official's order, requirement, decision or determination from which an appeal is taken, and make the correct order, requirement, decision, or determination. 
(iv)  Vote Required for Board Decisions. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of an administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under these zoning regulations, or to effect any variance to the zoning regulations granted by the Board. 
(v)  Judicial Review. Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Adjustment, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, or Board of the City may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality.

See the definition of Masonry construction for further information. 
(ii)  The following materials shall not qualify nor be defined as Masonry Construction in meeting the minimum requirements for the exterior construction of buildings, unless specifically approved by the City's Building Official for single-family or duplex residential structures, or by the City Council on an approved Concept Plan or Detailed Site Plan for single-family attached, multi-family, or non-residential structures:

4)  Street trees must be planted at the average rate of one (1) tree for every thirty (30) feet of street frontage. Where poor soil conditions or other factors require additional flexibility in planting, the Director of Planning or his or her designee may approve alternative spacing of trees, but not reduction in the number of required trees. 
5)  Existing trees at the required planting locations detailed above that meet these standards may be credited as street trees. 
(h)  Xeriscaping : 
(i)  Recognizing the need to reduce or eliminate the need for supplemental water from irrigation, the City seeks to encourage the implementation of water-efficient landscaping. This would require seven basic principles, namely good design; thorough soil preparation; limiting of irrigated shrub and lawn areas; adapted, low water demand plants; effective and efficient water methods; and proper landscape maintenance. 
(ii)  The City adheres to the principles advocated by Texas SmartScape. These principles can be found on their website, located at http://www.txsmartscape.com/index.php.

(ii)  Recommended plants: Shown in Section 5.04(a) is a list of recommended plants within each plant material type. The applicant may propose plants other than those listed if the plant seems appropriate for the intended use or the applicant maintains a plant care program sufficient to properly care for the proposed plant material. The City reserves the right to approve or disapprove required plants and planting through the Landscape Administrator or City appointed Landscape Architect, horticulturist, or other person so qualified. 
(iii)  Size requirements when planted: All plants shall equal or exceed the following measurements when planted. Plants larger than specified may be used but use of such plants shall not decrease the size requirements of other proposed plants. 
1)  Tree measurement: Canopy and understory trees with single trunks shall be measured at DBH. Multi-Trunk trees shall be measured by the height of the tree. 
2)  Minimum Sizes: Minimum plant size when planted shall be as follows:

3)  The Landscape Administrator may approve smaller sized shrubs based on unusual growing circumstances and/or on a specific design which reflects the overall intent of this Ordinance. 
(j)  Improvements in Public Right-of-Way and Easements : 
(i)  General: A developer shall be required to provide grass and irrigation in all unpaved areas of the public right-of-way. A maximum of ten (10) percent of the required interior plant material may be placed within the right-of-way parkway. Should the applicant elect to provide plantings in the public right-of-way. 
(ii)  Replacement responsibilities: The City shall endeavor to require replacement of all landscape/irrigation improvements as a part of contracts to install public utilities within public right-of-way and/or public easements. The City and owner shall not be responsible for replacing these improvements. In the event the City anticipates utility improvements conflicting with intended landscape/irrigation improvements, the City may require that the applicant wait to install said improvements until after the public improvements have been installed or under certain circumstances, the City may prohibit landscape improvements within the right-of-way. 
(iii)  General: The Owner shall be responsible for the continued maintenance in perpetuity of all landscaping and irrigation. All required landscaping shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner at all times. This shall include mowing, edging, pruning, fertilizing, watering, weeding, keeping beds mulched in accordance with standard horticultural practices or as recommended by the Landscape Administrator and other such activities common to the maintenance of landscaping. Landscaped areas shall be kept free of trash, litter; weeds and other such material or plants not a part of the landscaping. All plant materials shall be maintained in a healthy and growing condition as is appropriate for the season of the year. All irrigation heads or lines which are broken and flow water shall be replaced/repaired immediately to prevent the waste of water. 
Plant material replacement: The Owner shall be responsible for replacing all required plant material which shows dead branching over seventy-five (75) percent or more of the normal branching pattern during the time of a normal growing season and repair of irrigation system requirements set herein in perpetuity. Plant materials which die shall be replaced with plant material of similar variety and similar initial size. Upon notification by the City of such replacements, the Owner shall have thirty (30) days to comply with these requirements. Plant materials which die shall be replaced with plant material of similar variety and size, within thirty (30) days. Trees with a trunk diameter in excess of six (6) inches measured twenty-four (24) inches above the ground may be replaced with ones of similar variety having a trunk diameter of no less than three (3) inches measured twenty-four (24) inches above ground. However, if said landscape areas are above the minimum required landscape provisions, death of a plant or plant material which may still result in the requirements of the minimum standards being met does not necessitate replacement, except as required to maintain the integrity of the landscaping design. A time extension may be granted by the Director of Planning if substantial evidence is presented to indicate abnormal circumstances beyond the control of the owner or his agent. 
(iv)  Failure to maintain any landscape area in compliance with this section is considered a violation of this Section and may be subject to penalties of Section 8.03. 
(k)  Enforcement : 
(i)  Building permit: No building permits for building, paving, grading or construction shall be issued until a Landscape Plan meeting the requirements of this Ordinance has been approved by the Landscape Administrator. Under certain conditions the developer and the Landscape Administrator may negotiate the submittal of a Landscape Plan at some time after the issuance of the original building permit. 
(ii)  Certificate of occupancy: All plantings, screening, berms or other requirements of this Ordinance shall be installed prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.). Any sod intended must be installed, hydromulch areas must be sprayed. Turf establishment is not required prior to issuance of a C.O. 
1)  Temporary Certificate of Occupancy: In any case in which a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (T.C.O.) is issued because of a delay of the required landscape installation, it shall be in accordance with Section 2.05 herein. 
(iii)  Deferral of required landscape installation: In any case in which a C.O. is sought or plant replacement is required at a season of the year in which the Landscape Administrator determines that it would be impractical to install plantings as required herein, a deferral of the required plant replacement may be given for a period not to exceed six (6) months. The applicant shall be required to provide a letter of credit, or escrow deposit in an amount sufficient to cover the installation of the landscape and irrigation requirements herein, plus a ten (10) percent contingency. Such amount shall be evidenced by an itemized bid prepared by a qualified contractor. Upon the failure of the applicant to complete the installation requirements, the City shall have the right to draw upon the letter of credit or escrow deposit to complete the installation of the requirements herein. Any funds in excess of those required to complete the installation shall be retained by the City to offset administrative costs. 
(l)  Conflicting Ordinances : This Ordinance shall be and is hereby declared to be cumulative of all other ordinances of the City; and this Ordinance shall not operate to repeal or affect any of such other ordinances except insofar as the provisions thereof might be inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions of this Ordinance, in which event such conflicting provisions, if any, in such other ordinance or ordinances are hereby repealed.

Sec. 7.02 - Overlay District for Planned Development (PD) Districts. 
(a)  General Purpose and Description : 
(i)  Any initial request for a PD zoning change shall follow the procedures outlined in Section 2.04 of this Ordinance. 
(ii)  The PD is a zoning district which accommodates planned associations of uses developed as integral land use units such as industrial districts, offices, commercial or service centers, shopping centers, residential developments of multiple or mixed housing including attached single-family dwellings or any appropriate combination of uses which may be planned, developed or operated as integral land use units either by a single owner or a combination of owners. A PD may be used to permit new or innovative concepts in land utilization not permitted by other zoning districts in this Ordinance. 
(iii)  A PD may be created as an overlay district that combines with any other underlying base district except the FD Zoning District. The boundaries of each base zoning district shall be designated on the Concept Plan. 
(iv)  A PD for residential use may also be created as a Freestanding PD under prescribed circumstances. 
1)  The ordinance approving an amendment to the zoning ordinance may establish multiple PD overlay districts, or one or more PD overlay districts together with a Freestanding PD, provided that the proposed development is integrated in purpose and design. 
2)  A Freestanding PD for residential use must establish complete zoning district development standards for the subject property zoned under the PD. 
a)  No base or underlying zoning district is required since the Freestanding PD will not default to an underlying zone. 
b)  In the event a Freestanding PD is created, the zoning map shall identify FPD as the abbreviated designation and the approving ordinance number must be included within the official text and map references. 
c)  The Freestanding PD ordinance must either include a use chart or reference which zoning district use chart will be followed. 
d)  The Freestanding PD ordinance shall include a table showing the types and numbers of units by lot size, and the acreage and density of each type of dwelling unit or lot size group. The ordinance also shall identify the type and quantity of open space and amenities and the time and manner of providing such open space and amenities. 
(b)  Permitted uses : An application for a PD shall specify the use or the combination of uses proposed. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the ordinance establishing the PD, uses permitted in a PD are limited to those allowed in the base districts in Section 33. The ordinance establishing the PD may restrict uses otherwise allowed in the base district or may provide for uses not otherwise allowed in the base district, provided such uses are compatible with adjacent land uses and are consistent with the purpose of the PD. Uses allowed by Specific Use Permits (SUP) in a base zoning district are allowed in a PD only if specifically identified in the ordinance establishing the PD. When a Freestanding PD is created, the uses allowed in the PD District shall be limited to those specified in the ordinance establishing the District. 
(c)  Planned Development (PD) Zoning District requirements : 
(i)  Development requirements for each separate PD shall be set forth in the Ordinance establishing the PD and shall include, but may not be limited to: uses, density, lot area, lot width, lot depth, yard depths and widths, building height, building elevations, coverage, floor area ratio, parking, access, screening, landscaping, accessory buildings, signs, lighting, project phasing or scheduling, management associations, and other requirements as the City Council and Planning and Zoning Commission may deem appropriate.

2)  For a residential PD comprised of more than four (4) lots, other than for multi-family residential development, a preliminary plat shall qualify as the Detailed Site Plan. In such event, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall each approve the Preliminary Plat in accordance with procedures in the City's Subdivision Regulations and in conformance with the criteria for approval in this section. For a single-family residential PD comprised of four (4) or fewer lots, the building permit for each dwelling shall quality as the Detailed Site Plan. 
3)  The Detailed Site Plan may be submitted for the total area of the PD, or for any sections or phases shown on the approved Concept Plan or, for single-family or duplex residential developments, for any phase of the approved preliminary plat. 
(iii)  A Detailed Site Plan may be submitted and approved in lieu of a Concept Plan if the Detailed Site Plan meets all the requirements for both plans. 
(iv)  Changes of detail on the Detailed Site Plan, which differ from the original Concept Plan, but do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property, the uses permitted, or increase the density, building height or coverage of the site, the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site, or do not significantly alter the landscape plans as indicated on the approved Concept Plan may be authorized by the City Manager or designated representative. 
(e)  Approval process : 
(i)  Establishment of a PD shall be deemed an amendment to the zoning ordinance and shall be subject to the procedures for zoning amendments as set forth in Section 2.04. 
1)  The initial ordinance establishing the PD may include only the Concept Plan or both the Concept Plan and Detailed Site Plan. 
a)  If approved for Concept Plan only, then a Detailed Site Plan will be required as a separate application that will be reviewed and approved. 
b)  If approved for both plans, then any materialistic changes to the development will require a new or modifying ordinance. 
2)  A Detailed Site Plan in lieu of a Concept Plan, shall be incorporated within the ordinance establishing the PD. 
(ii)  Detailed Site Plan 
1)  A PD Ordinance approved with only a Concept Plan for the development requires a Detailed Site Plan to complete the PD. 
a)  The Detailed Site Plan shall meet all requirements of Section 7.01. 
b)  A Detailed Site Plan that materialistically complies with the Concept Plan may be reviewed and approved by the City Manager or designated representative. 
c)  A Detailed Site Plan that does not materialistically comply with the Concept Plan requires a new PD Ordinance. 
(iii)  A new PD Ordinance modifying the Concept Plan still requires a Detailed Site Plan. 
1)  The new PD Ordinance may incorporate the Detailed Site Plan. 
(iv)  A PD Ordinance approved with both a Concept Plan and Detailed Site Plan requires a new ordinance to modify any details contained in either the Concept Plan or Detailed Site Plan. If the modifications do not significantly alter the approved ordinance, then the review and approval may be authorized by the City Manager or designated representative. 
(v)  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall use the following criteria in recommending and the Council in deciding whether to approve, approve with modifications or conditions, or deny a request for establishment of a PD. 
1)  The extent to which the proposed PD District furthers the policies of the Comprehensive Plan; 
2)  The extent to which the proposed PD District will result in a superior development than could be achieved through conventional zoning classifications; 
3)  The extent to which the proposed PD District will resolve or mitigate any compatibility issues with surrounding development; 
4)  The extent to which proposed uses and the configuration of uses depicted in the Concept Plan are compatible with existing and planned adjoining uses; 
5)  The extent to which the proposed development is consistent with adopted master facilities plans, including without limitation the water facilities, master wastewater facilities, transportation, drainage and other master facilities plans; 
6)  The extent to which the proposed open space and recreational amenities within the development provide a superior living environment and enhanced recreational opportunities for residents of the district and for the public generally; and 
7)  For residential planned developments, the extent to which the proposed Concept Plan provides for and integrates open space and amenities into the plan for development. 
(vi)  The Ordinance establishing the PD shall not be approved until the Concept Plan or Detailed Site Plan is approved. 
1)  A Detailed Site Plan may be approved for the entire PD or in sections. When a Detailed Site Plan is approved in sections, then separate approvals will be required. In acting on the application, the approval shall determine whether the Detailed Site Plan conforms to the standards and conditions in the ordinance establishing the PD and to the approved Concept Plan. 
2)  A Detailed Site Plan shall be submitted for approval for within one (1) year from the approval of the ordinance establishing the PD for some portion of the Concept Plan unless a different time is specified in the ordinance. If the land is to be developed in phases, each subsequent Detailed Site Plan shall be approved within one year of the last approved Site Plan, or as otherwise may be provided in a phasing schedule. 
3)  If a Detailed Site Plan is not submitted within such one (1) year period or as provided by a phasing schedule, the authority to submit a Detail Site Plan and all subsequent Detail Site Plans for the PD shall be suspended. Following suspension of the right to submit a Detailed Site Plan, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider and recommend to the City Council whether the right to submit a Detailed Site Plan should be reinstated, or whether the undeveloped land within the PD should be changed to another zoning district classification. 
4)  The City Council, following a public hearing, shall determine whether the right to submit the Detailed Site Plan application should be reinstated, or whether the property should be rezoned to another classification. In making such determination, the City Council shall consider the following factors:

ARTICLE 1. - FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Section A. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Waxahachie are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
Section B. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
Section C. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requires that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Controls filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
ARTICLE 2. - DEFINITIONS 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH or VO Zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three (3) feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood-protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be comprised. 
    Development means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building (i) built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls, if the breakaway walls meet the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Flood-protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood-protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community. 
    Program deficiency means a defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations or of the standards Sections in 60.3, 60.4, 60.5 or 60.6 [of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations]. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impact of its noncompliance. Ways that impact may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Start of construction, for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure either (1) before the improvement or repair is started or, (2) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this ordinance when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. (For full requirements, see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) [of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations] is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
ARTICLE 3. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Section A. - Lands to which this ordinance applies. 
    This ordinance shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Waxahachie. 
Section B. - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the current scientific and engineering reports entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Ellis County, Texas, and incorporated Areas," dated June 3, 2013, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dated June 3, 2013; and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 1951, 1-19-99; Ord. No. 2702, 5-6-13) 
Section C. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this ordinance.

(d)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; 
(e)  Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with Article 4, section (B)(1). 
(2)  Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this ordinance and the following relevant factors: 
(a)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(b)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(c)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(d)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(e)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(f)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; 
(g)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(h)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(i)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(j)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
Section D. - Variance procedures. 
(1)  The appeal board as established by the community shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance. 
(2)  The appeal board shall hear and render judgement on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance. 
(3)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(4)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this ordinance. 
(6)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section C(2) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(7)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance (Article 1, section B). 
(8)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(9)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(a)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(b)  Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(10)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the criteria outlined in Article 4, section D(1) through (9) are met and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
ARTICLE 5. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Section A. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed and constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities located at least one foot above the base flood elevation to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
Section B. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards, where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Article 3, section B, Article 4, section B(8) or Article 5, section C(4), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction: New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in Article 4, section C(1)(a), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction: New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one foot above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific elevation in relation to mean sea level to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(a)  A minimum of two (2) openings, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding, shall be provided; 
(b)  The bottoms of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
(c)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exist of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes: 
(a)  Prohibits the placement of any manufactured housing within areas which are designated or identified as regulatory floodways; 
(b)  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(c)  All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with Article 5, section B(1); 
(d)  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot above the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provision of section B(4) of this article. 
Section C. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with Article 1, sections A, B and C of this ordinance. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet development permit requirements of Article 3, section C; Article 4, section C; and the provisions of Article 5 of this ordinance. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which contain five (5) lots or more or one acre or more, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Article 3, section B or Article 4, section B(8) of this ordinance. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
Section D. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3, section B are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three (3) feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade, at least one foot greater than the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
(a)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade, at least one foot greater than the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified); or 
(b)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capacity of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; 
(3)  A registered professional engineer shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Article 4, section C(1)(a), are satisfied; 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
Section E. - Floodways. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3, section B are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, unless certification by a professional registered engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
(2)  If Article 5, section E(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements must comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 5. 
ARTICLE 6. - DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY 
    It is hereby found and declared by the City of Waxahachie that severe flooding has occurred in the past within its jurisdiction and will certainly occur within the future; that flooding is likely to result in infliction of serious personal injury or death, and is likely to result in substantial injury or destruction of property within standards for coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program; and in order to effectively remedy the situation described herein, it is necessary that this ordinance become effective immediately. 
    Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this ordinance, being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.

I. GENERAL - PROVISIONS 

Section 1.1: - Authority. 
    The following rules and regulations are hereby adopted as the Subdivision Ordinance of the City of Waxahachie, Texas, also known and cited as the "Waxahachie Subdivision Ordinance," and shall be applicable to the filing of plats and the subdivision of land, as that term is defined herein and in Chapter 212 of the Texas Local Government Code, within the corporate City limits of the City of Waxahachie, as they may be from time to time adjusted by annexation or disannexation, and within all the areas of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Waxahachie, as that area may exist from time to time as provided by Chapter 42 of the Texas Local Government Code. The City shall have all remedies and rights provided by said Chapter 212 with regard to the control and approval of subdivisions and plats both within the City and within its extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
Section 1.2: - Interpretation and Purpose. 
    In the interpretation and application of the provisions of these regulations, it is the intention of the City Council that the principles, standards and requirements provided for herein shall be minimum requirements for the platting and developing of subdivisions within the City of Waxahachie and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, and superseding the previous Subdivision Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 0906, § 29, 4-10-69) 
    The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of urban development. The distribution and relationship of residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural uses throughout the community, along with the system of improvements for thoroughfares, utilities, public facilities and community amenities, determine, in large measure, the quality of life enjoyed by the residents of the community. Health, safety, economy, amenities, environmental sensitivity, and convenience are all factors which influence and determine a community's quality of life and overall character. A community's quality of life is of the public interest. Consequently, the subdivision of land, as it affects a community's quality of life, is an activity where regulation is a valid function of municipal government. The regulations contained herein are designed and intended to encourage the development of a quality urban environment by establishing standards for the provision of adequate light, air, open space, storm water drainage, transportation, public utilities and facilities, and other needs necessary for ensuring the creation and continuance of a healthy, attractive, safe and efficient community that provides for the conservation, enhancement and protection of its human and natural resources. Through the application of these regulations, the interests of the public, as well as those public and private parties, both present and future, having interest in property affected by these regulations, are protected by the granting of certain rights and privileges. By establishing a fair and rational procedure for developing land, the requirements in this Ordinance further the possibility that land will be developed for its most beneficial use in accordance with existing social, economic and environmental conditions. 
    The procedure and standards for the development, layout and design of subdivisions of land within the corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Waxahachie, Texas are intended to: 
a.  Promote the development and the utilization of land in a manner that assures the best possible community environment in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Waxahachie; 
b.  Guide and assist the developers in the correct procedures to be followed, and to inform them of the standards which shall be required; 
c.  Protect the public interest by supervising the location, design, class and type of streets, sidewalks, utilities and essential areas and services required; 
d.  Assist orderly, efficient and coordinated development within the City limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction; 
e.  Provide neighborhood conservation and prevent the development of slums and blight; 
f.  Harmoniously relate the development of various tracts of land to the existing community, and facilitate the future development of adjoining tracts; 
g.  Provide that the cost of improvements to minimum standards which primarily benefit the tract of land being developed be borne by the owners or developers of the tract, and that the cost of improvements to minimum standards which primarily benefit the whole community be borne by the whole community as contained in this Ordinance; 
h.  Provide the best possible design for each tract being subdivided; 
i.  Provide the most attractive relationship between the uses of land and buildings; provide for the circulation of traffic throughout the municipality, having particular regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways; provide for pedestrian circulation that is appropriate for the various uses of land and buildings; and provide the proper location and width of streets; 
j.  Prevent pollution of the air, streams and ponds; assure the adequacy of drainage facilities; safeguard both surface and groundwater supplies; and encourage the wise use and management of natural resources throughout the municipality in order to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the community and the value of the land; 
k.  Preserve the natural beauty and topography of the municipality, and ensure development that is appropriate with regard to these natural features; 
l.  Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision; 
m.  Ensure that public or private facilities are available and will have sufficient capacity to serve proposed and future subdivisions and developments within the City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction; 
n.  Protect and provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of the community; 
o.  Provide for adequate light, air and privacy; secure safety from fire, flood and other danger; and prevent overcrowding of the land and undue congestion of population; 
p.  Protect the character and the social and economic stability of all parts of the community, and encourage the orderly and beneficial development of all parts of the community; 
q.  Protect and conserve the value of land throughout the community and the value of buildings and improvements upon the land, and minimize conflicts among the uses of land and buildings; 
r.  Guide public and private policy and action in providing adequate and efficient transportation systems, public utilities, and other public amenities and facilities; and 
s.  Encourage the development of a stable, prospering economic environment. 
    Minimum standards for development are contained in the City's Construction & Design (C & D) Manual, related technical standards, the Zoning Ordinance, the Building Code and in this Ordinance. However, the Comprehensive Plan, the Future Land Use Plan, and the City's Water and Wastewater Master Plans express policies designed to achieve an optimum quality of development in the urban area. If only the minimum standards are followed, as expressed by the various ordinances regulating land development, a standardization of development will occur. This will produce a monotonous urban setting. Subdivision design shall be of a quality that will carry out the purpose and spirit of the policies expressed within the Comprehensive Plan and within this Ordinance, and shall be encouraged to exceed the minimum standards required herein. 
Section 1.3: - Application of Regulations. 
    No subdivision plat within the City limits or the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be recorded until a final plat, accurately describing the property to be conveyed, has been approved in accordance with this Subdivision Ordinance. Furthermore, no building permit, certificate of occupancy, plumbing permit, electrical permit, flood plain permit, utility tap, or certificate of acceptance for required public improvements shall be issued by the City for any parcel of land or plat until: 
a.  A final plat has been approved in accordance with these regulations; and 
b.  All improvements, as required by these regulations, have been constructed and accepted by the City of Waxahachie, or 
c.  Assurances for completion of improvements have been provided in accordance with Section 6. 
    When the final plat is filed at the County, it shall be accompanied by a tax certificate, in accordance with State law. 
Section 1.4: - Jurisdiction. 
    The provisions of this Subdivision Ordinance, as authorized by Subchapters A and B of Chapter 212 of the Texas Local Government Code, including the Construction & Design (C & D) Manual, shall apply to the following forms of land subdivision and development activity within the City's limits or its extraterritorial jurisdiction: 
a.  The division of land into two (2) or more tracts, lots, sites or parcels; or 
b.  All subdivisions of land whether by metes and bounds division or by plat, which were outside the jurisdiction of the City's subdivision regulations in Ellis County, Texas and which subsequently came within the jurisdiction of the City's subdivision regulations through: 
1.  Annexation; or 
2.  Extension of the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
c.  The combining of two (2) or more contiguous tracts, lots, sites or parcels for the purpose of creating one or more legal lots in order to achieve a more developable site, except as otherwise provided herein; or 
d.  When a building permit is required for the following uses: 
1.  Residential single-family and duplex: 
(a)  New construction. 
(b)  Moving of a primary structure onto vacant property. 
2.  Nonresidential and multi-family: 
(a)  New construction; 
(b)  Additions (increasing square footage of existing building by more than twenty (20) percent of the gross floor area); or 
(c)  Moving a primary structure onto vacant property. 
e.  For tracts where any public improvements are proposed; or 
f.

1.  Granting the waiver will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare, and will not be injurious to other property; 
2.  The conditions upon which the request for a waiver is based are unique to the property for which the waiver is sought, and are not applicable generally to other property; 
3.  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the standard is strictly applied; 
4.  The waiver is not contrary to the intent and purpose of these subdivision regulations. 
d.  Conditions. In approving a waiver, the City Council may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the purposes described in Section 1.2. 
Section 1.12: - Petition for Relief. 
a.  Petition for Relief. The applicant for a subdivision application, or the owner of the property subject thereto, may petition the City Council for relief from the application of any provision of this Subdivision Ordinance that requires dedication of an interest in land for rights-of-way or construction of capital improvements in order to provide adequate water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities to serve the proposed subdivision, or the imposition of a condition related thereto. The petition must allege that application of the provision or the imposition of conditions relating to the provision and requiring such dedication of land or construction of capital improvements is not roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed development on the City's water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities system, as the case may be, or does not reasonably benefit the proposed development. The petition may also allege that the application of the provision or the imposition of conditions relating to the provision deprives the applicant or the property owner of the economically viable use of the land, or of a vested property right. 
1.  Prior to decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission on a subdivision application that is subject to this Section, an applicant who proposes to challenge the application of a provision that requires dedication of an interest in land for rights-of-way or construction of capital improvements to serve the proposed subdivision, or the imposition of conditions related thereto, shall file a notice of intent to appeal such determination to the City Council. Approval of such subdivision application by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall include a condition that approval is subject to the Council's decision on the petition for relief. 
2.  If a petition for a waiver from the requirements of this Subdivision Ordinance pursuant to Section 1.11 has been filed by the petitioner, the petition for relief may be submitted in conjunction with the Council's review of such request. 
3.  If the subdivision application otherwise may be finally decided by an administrative officer of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the petition for relief shall be submitted by the petitioner within ten (10) calendar days of receiving the staff report applying the requirement or imposing the condition. 
b.  Study Required. The applicant or property owner shall provide a study in support of the petition for relief that includes the following information: 
1.  Total capacity of the City's water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities system to be utilized by the proposed development, employing standard measures of capacity and equivalency tables relating the type of development proposed to the quantity of system capacity to be consumed by the development. If the subdivision application is part of a phased development project, such information shall also be provided for the entire development proposed, including any phase already developed. 
2.  Total capacity to be supplied to the City's water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities system by the proposed dedication of an interest in land for rights-of-way or construction of capital improvements. If the subdivision application is part of a phased development project, the information shall include any capacity supplied by prior dedications or construction of capital improvements. 
3.  The study supplied by the petitioner shall be evaluated by City staff, who shall make its recommendation to the City Council based upon the information contained in the study and any additional information related to the petition produced by the staff. In evaluating the petition, the staff shall take into account the maximum amount of any impact fees to be assessed against the development, as well as any traffic impact, drainage or other adequate facilities studies evaluating the impacts of the development or similar developments on the City's water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities systems. 
c.  Action on Petition. The City Council shall consider the petition and determine whether the application of the provision requiring dedication of an interest in land for rights-of-way or construction of capital improvements in order to provide adequate water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities to serve the proposed subdivision, or the imposition of a condition related thereto, is roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed development on such public facilities systems, and reasonably benefits the development. In making such determination, the City Council shall consider the evidence submitted by the applicant or property owner and the staff's recommendation. If the petition also alleges that the proposed dedication or construction requirements constitute a deprivation of the economically viable use of the land or of a vested property right, the Council shall also resolve such issues. Following such determinations, the Council may take any of the following actions: 
1.  Deny the petition for relief, and impose the requirement or condition; or 
2.  Deny the petition for relief, upon finding that the proposed dedication or construction requirements are inadequate to offset the impacts of the development upon community water, wastewater, roadway or drainage facilities, and either deny the subdivision application or require that additional dedications of rights-of-way for, or improvements to such, facilities systems be made as a condition of approval of the application; or 
3.  Grant the petition for relief, and waive in whole or in part any dedication or construction requirement that is not roughly proportional; or 
4.  Grant the petition for relief, and direct that the City participate in the costs of acquiring rights-of-way for or constructing such facility pursuant to standard City participation policies.

d.  Council Action. The City Council may take one of the following actions: 
(1)  Reinstate the expired prior or final plat subject to such expiration dates as may be authorized by law, if it finds that the petitioner has met any one of the criteria listed in subsection (c)(1). 
(2)  Reinstate the expired prior plat for all or part of the land subject thereto, if it finds that the petitioner has met any one of the criteria listed in subsection (e)(2), subject to such expiration dates or other conditions that assure that the remaining land that is not subject to an approved or pending final plat application will be developed in a timely fashion. In granting relief under this provision, the Council may require that development of such remaining land is subject to standards enacted after initial approval of the expired prior plat. 
(3)  Deny the petition, if it finds that the petitioner has failed to meet any of the criteria in subsection (c). 
(4)  Reinstate the prior plat for only that part of the land subject to a pending final plat application, if it finds that the petitioner has met the criteria in subsection (c)(2)(B) and the pending plat application subsequently was approved, and deny the petition for the remaining land within the expired prior plat. 
(Ord. No. 2329, § 1, 8-15-05) 
II. - PROCEDURES 

Section 2.1: - Pre-Application Procedures. 
a.  Complete Application Determination. Every application for approval of a preliminary plat or final plat shall be subject to a determination of completeness by the planning director. No application shall be accepted for processing unless it is accompanied by all documents required by and prepared in accordance with the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations. The director from time to time may identify additional requirements for a complete application that are not contained within but are consistent with the application contents and standards set forth in the Subdivision Regulations. The director also may promulgate a fee for review of the application for completeness. 
b.  Incompleteness as Grounds for Denial. The processing of an application by any City official or employee prior to the time the application is determined to be complete shall not be binding on the City as the official acceptance of the application for filing, and the incompleteness of the application shall be grounds for denial or revocation of the application. A determination of completeness shall not constitute a determination of compliance with the substantive requirements of these Subdivision Regulations. 
c.  Pre-application Conference. A property owner may request a pre-application conference with the director for purposes of identifying requirements that are applicable to a proposed plat. The request shall be made in writing on a form prepared by the director and shall state that any proposed development concept discussed at the pre-application conference is not intended as a plan of development or application for plat approval. 
d.  Time for Making Determination. Following submission of a plan of development or plat application, the planning director shall make a determination in writing whether the plan or application constitutes a complete application for a preliminary plat or a final plat not later than the tenth business day after the date the application is submitted. The determination shall specify the documents or other information needed to complete the application and shall state the date the application will expire if the documents or other information is not provided. 
e.  When Deemed Complete. An application for approval of a preliminary plat that is filed on or after April 28, 2005, or any subsequent preliminary plat or final plat application filed after approval of such preliminary plat, shall be deemed complete on the 11th business day after the application has been received, if the applicant has not otherwise been notified that the application is incomplete. 
f.  Time for Completing Application. If an application is not completed on or before the 45th day after the application is submitted to the planning director for processing the application in accordance with his or her written notification, the application will be deemed to have expired and it will be returned to the applicant together with any accompanying documents. Thereafter, a new application for approval of the preliminary plat or final plat must be submitted. The City may retain any fee paid for reviewing the application for completeness. 
g.  Sequence of Applications. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subdivision Ordinance to the contrary, an application for a preliminary plat or final plat shall not be considered complete unless accompanied by a copy of the zoning ordinance or other certification verifying that the proposed use, lots sizes and lot dimensions for which the application is submitted is authorized by the zoning district in which the property is located. 
h.  Vested Rights. No vested rights accrue solely from the filing of an application that has expired pursuant to this section, or from the filing of a complete application that is subsequently denied. 
i.  Official Filing Date. The time period established by state law or these subdivision regulations for processing or deciding an application shall commence on the date that a complete application has been accepted for filing, which date shall be deemed the official filing date. 
(Ord. No. 2329, § 2, 8-15-05) 
Section 2.2: - General Requirements and Procedures. 
a.  Zoning Requirements. 
A property within the City's corporate limits that is being proposed for platting must be properly zoned by the City prior to submission of an application for approval of any plat. In addition, the proposed development layout or subdivision design shown on the proposed plat must be in conformance with all standards and requirements prescribed in the City's Zoning Ordinance. 
Noncompliance with the requirements of the zoning district in which the subject property is located, or lack of the proper zoning, shall constitute grounds for denial of the plat. In situations where the zoning on a particular piece of property cannot be ascertained by the City, the burden of proof regarding the property's zoning shall rest with the property owner. Proof of proper zoning shall consist of appropriate documentation, such as a copy of the ordinance establishing the zoning, which shall be reviewed by City officials as to its validity and authenticity. 
Any plat submitted for approval by the City shall be in accordance with the City's Zoning Ordinance, if the property is located within the City's corporate limits, and if the property is located within the City's corporate limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction, it shall be in accordance with the City's Comprehensive Plan, including all adopted water, sewer, storm drainage, future land use, park, recreation, open space and thoroughfare plans. All plats shall be prepared by a licensed civil engineer or a registered professional land surveyor. 
b.  Classification of Subdivisions and Additions. Before any land is platted (i.e., filed for record), the property owner shall apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision plat, in accordance with the following procedures, unless otherwise provided within this Ordinance. Subdivisions are classified as major or minor (see definitions), depending upon the number of lots to be created and upon whether or not any public improvements will be required to develop the property. 
1.  Minor subdivisions may be approved for residential or nonresidential properties. Minor plat approval requires the submission of a final plat drawing and other submission materials required by Section 2.11 of this Ordinance. Lots may be conveyed or sold only when the plat has been approved by the City Council and the plat has been filed at Ellis County. 
2.  Major subdivisions involve the creation of new streets, the construction/extension of a municipal facility(s), and/or the creation of more than four (4) lots. Major subdivisions may be approved for residential or non-residential properties. The procedure for approval of a major plat typically requires three (3) steps: land study, preliminary plat and final plat (see Sections 2.3 through 2.6 for applicability and requirements for each). A concept plan that includes sufficient information to provide for the proper coordination of the development may be required for non-residential property. Major plat approval shall be in accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.6. Upon completion of the required public improvements (or upon submission of the appropriate surety for public improvements), the property owner may submit the final plat for approval. All major subdivision plats must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, pursuant to Section 2.4 through Section 2.8. Lots may be conveyed or sold only when the plat has been approved by the City Council and the plat has been filed at Ellis County. 
c.  Submission Requirements For All Types of Plat Applications. In addition to the requirements outlined herein for each type of development application, the City shall maintain separate policies and procedures for the submission and processing of applications including, but not limited to, application forms, checklists, language blocks for plats, and other similar items. The forms and paperwork are available at the office of the City Manager, or designee. These policies and procedures may be amended from time to time, and it is the applicant's responsibility to be familiar with, and to comply with, the policies and procedures. 
d.  Official Submission Date and Completeness of Application For All Types of Plats. 
1.  For the purpose of these regulations, the "official submission date" shall be the date upon which a complete application for approval of any type of plat, that contains all required elements mandated by the Texas Local Government Code, Section 212.004(b) and by this Ordinance, is submitted to the City Manager (or designee), after which the statutory period required for approval or disapproval of the plat shall commence to run. No application shall be deemed officially submitted until the City Manager (or designee) determines that the application is complete and a fee receipt is issued by the City. Failure by the City Manager (or designee) to make a determination of incompleteness within ten (10) calendar days following the date on which the application was first received by the City, shall result in the application being deemed complete, and the "official submission date" shall become the 11th calendar day following initial receipt of the application by the City. 
2.  Plat applications which do not include all required information and materials, as outlined below and per other City development review policies which may change from time to time, will be considered incomplete, shall not be accepted for official submission by the City, and shall not be scheduled on a Commission agenda until the proper information is provided to City officials. 
e.  Action by Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall approve or disapprove a preliminary or final plat (or other type of plat, including replat) application, or shall identify requirements which must be satisfied prior to approval of such application, within thirty (30) days of the official submission date. For purposes of this Section, identification of requirements which must be satisfied prior to approval of the application shall be considered denial of the plat application. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall act on the plat application within thirty (30) days of the official submission date. The City Council shall act upon the plat application within thirty (30) days following the Commission's action. All plats for a major subdivision shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council. 
f.  Simultaneous Submission of Plats. In the event that an applicant submits preliminary and final plat applications simultaneously, as provided in Section 2.4(c), the City Manager (or designee) shall schedule both plat applications for action by the Planning and Zoning Commission within thirty (30) days of the official submission date, unless the applicant has executed a waiver of the thirty-day review period (in writing) for one or both plats. If the preliminary plat has not received approval prior to consideration of the final plat by the Commission, then the Commission shall deny the final plat application. 
g.  Proof of Land Ownership. The City requires proof of land ownership prior to approval of any development application involving real property. Along with the application submission, the applicant shall provide written verification, such as a notarized statement or a power of attorney or other evidence satisfactory to the City Manager, that he or she is the owner of record of the subject land parcel or parcels, or is the property owner's authorized agent. The City Manager (or designee) shall have the authority to determine what document(s) the City will require to prove ownership, such as one of the following: 
1.  General warranty deed; 
2.  Special warranty deed; 
3.  Title policy; or 
4.  Some other documentation that is acceptable to the City Manager (or designee). 
If ownership cannot be conclusively established prior to the meeting date on which the development application will be heard, the City shall have the authority to deny the application on the basis of protecting the public interest. The applicant may resubmit a new development application, including the submission fees, for the property at any time following such denial. 
(Ord. No. 2229, § 2(B), 4-5-04) 
Section 2.3: - Procedures and Submission Requirements for Preliminary Plat Approval. 
a.  1.  The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat and preliminary construction information of the subdivision and other supplementary materials, as specified. The preliminary plat shall be submitted to the City of Waxahachie with the appropriate filing fee (as provided in the City's plat submission guidelines, as may be amended from time to time), and with a written application form at least twenty-eight (28) calendar days (but no more than thirty (30) calendar days, unless the applicant waives the thirty-day review time in writing) prior to the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting at which it is to be considered. The application shall include preliminary construction information, including any drawings and documentation necessary to give the City a clear understanding of how the site will generally be served by required public services and facilities (e.g., water, sewer, roadway access, etc.). The application shall be signed by the record owner of the property if the owner is not the same as the applicant. 
2.  At the time the developer files a preliminary plat application with the City Manager (or designee), a certificate showing that all taxes have been paid on the property to be subdivided, and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in accordance with Section 1.14, shall also be filed. 
3.  The application shall contain information demonstrating that all standards of approval in section 2.4(g) have been met. 
4.  The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a registered/certified engineer, land planner or surveyor. 
b.  Copies of prints of the proposed subdivision drawn on sheets at a size of twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches, and drawn to a scale of one hundred (100) feet or fifty (50) feet to the inch, shall be submitted in the number of copies specified by the City (as provided in the City's plat submission guidelines, as may be amended from time to time). In cases of large developments which would exceed the dimensions of the sheet of one-hundred-foot scale, preliminary plats may be on multiple sheets or may be two hundred (200) feet to the inch or another known engineering scale, as approved by the City Manager (or designee). 
Preliminary plats which do not include the required data, number of copies and information will be considered incomplete, shall not be accepted for submission by the City, and shall not be scheduled on a Planning and Zoning Commission agenda until the proper information is provided to City staff. Additional copies of the preliminary plat may be required if revisions or corrections are necessary. A preliminary plat, if not preceded by a land study showing phasing of the development, shall include all contiguous property under the ownership or control of the applicant. It may contain more than one phase which, if so, shall be clearly identified. 
c.  The subdivider may choose to submit a final plat for review concurrently with the preliminary plat. In such case, the City may schedule concurrent review of both plats, provided that all required information and other items are submitted for both plats (including full construction plans and the appropriate assurances for the completion of all improvements, as per Section 6), and provided that adequate review can be achieved by the City. If the City cannot review both plats (and other associated materials) within the twenty-eight-day review period, then only the preliminary plat shall be considered for approval and the final plat shall be denied unless the thirty-day review requirement is waived in writing by the applicant. 
d.  Following review of the preliminary plat and other materials submitted in conformity to these regulations, and following discussions with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements to be installed, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall act upon the preliminary plat as it was submitted, or as modified. If approved, the Commission shall state the conditions of such approval, if any, and the preliminary plat shall be placed on the next possible City Council agenda for consideration. The City Council shall take action within thirty (30) days following the Planning and Zoning Commission's action. 
The Planning and Zoning Commission (and ultimately City Council) shall only approve the actual plat drawing (i.e., the sheet(s) showing the actual plat for the subdivision, which will eventually be approved by the City and then filed at the County in "Final Plat" form), and the screening wall/landscaping plan(s) (as a separate agenda item) if the project/subdivision includes any required screening device (e.g., along major roadways or as required for screening/buffering the property from roads and/or adjacent properties). The construction (i.e., engineering) plans for the subdivision shall be submitted within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days following approval of the preliminary plat, and shall be reviewed and approved by the Public Works Director and/or other City staff, as deemed appropriate. 
e.  Approval of a preliminary plat by the Planning and Zoning Commission and by City Council shall be deemed as tentative approval of the street and lot layout shown on the preliminary plat, and as authorization to proceed with preparation of the construction plans. 
f.  If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies a preliminary plat application, the Commission shall state such disapproval and the reasons therefor. The plat application is not forwarded to City Council for consideration unless the applicant submits a written appeal within ten (10) calendar days following the Commission's decision. The City Council shall take action within thirty (30) days following the Planning and Zoning Commission's action. The City Council may affirm, modify or reverse (i.e., override) the decision of the Commission, or it may, where appropriate, remand the preliminary plat back to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with the City Council's direction. 
g.  Standards for Approval. No preliminary plat shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission or by the City Council unless the following standards have been met: 
1.  The plat substantially conforms with the City's Zoning Ordinance (including the proper zoning for the intended use) and its Comprehensive Plan, including all other adopted plans including, but not limited to, the Water and Wastewater Master Plans, Future Land Use Plan, Park and Open Space Plan, and Thoroughfare Plan, as applicable. 
2.  The preliminary layouts for required public improvements and City utilities are in conformance with City codes and policies. 
3.  The plat conforms to applicable zoning, subdivision and other development regulations. 
4.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subdivision Ordinance, no preliminary plat containing more than fifty (50) acres of contiguous land or land in unified ownership may be approved or conditionally approved, where the proposed development requires the extension of offsite city water or wastewater mains, which facilities have not been included in a capital improvements plan and funded, or for which funding has been provided in an approved development agreement, at the time a complete application for a preliminary plat is filed. This requirement shall not be circumvented by the filing of separate or sequential applications for preliminary plats. 
h.  No construction work shall begin on the proposed improvements in the proposed subdivision prior to approval of the engineering/construction plans by the Public Works Director. The applicant shall also provide copies of letters from applicable local utility companies stating that each utility company has reviewed the preliminary plat and stating any requirements (including easements) they may have. This requirement may be deferred until the final plat is submitted if such deferral is approved by the Public Works Director. No excavation, including grading and clearing of vegetation, shall occur prior to approval of the preliminary plat and the construction (i.e., engineering) plans. 
i.  The required copies or prints (as determined by the City) of the proposed preliminary plat and construction (i.e., engineering) plans shall show the following: 
1.  A vicinity or location map that delineates the location of the proposed preliminary plat in the City; 
2.  Boundary lines, abstract lines, corporate boundaries, existing or proposed highways and streets, bearings and distances sufficient to locate the exact area proposed for the subdivision; 
3.  The name, location and recording information of all adjoining subdivisions (or property owners of unplatted property) shall be drawn to the same scale and shown in dotted lines adjacent to the tract proposed for subdivision in sufficient detail to show accurately the existing streets, alleys and other features that may influence the layout of development of the proposed subdivision; adjacent unplatted land shall show property lines, the names of owners of record, and the recording information; 
4.  The location and widths of all streets, alleys and easements, existing or proposed, within the subdivision limits and adjacent to the subdivision; a list of proposed street names shall be submitted for all new streets (street name approval is required at the time the preliminary plat is approved); 
5.  The location of all existing property lines, existing lot and block numbers and date recorded, buildings, existing sewer or water mains, gas mains or other underground structures, easements of record or other existing features within the area proposed for subdivision; 
6.  Proposed arrangement and square footage of lots (including lot and block numbers) and proposed use of same; 
7.  The title under which the proposed subdivision is to be recorded, the name and address of the owner with the name of the planner, engineer or registered public surveyor preparing the drawing; the subdivision name shall not be duplicated, but phasing identification is allowed (the City shall determine if the proposed subdivision identification will be in conflict with existing plats); 
8.  Sites, if any, to be reserved or dedicated for parks, schools, playgrounds or other public uses; 
9.  Scale, date, north arrow oriented to the top or left side of the sheet, and other pertinent data; 
10.  Contours with intervals of five (5) feet or less shown for the area (unless, due to some unique aspect of the subject property, the Director of Public Works requires a two-foot contour interval) with all elevations on the contour map referenced to sea level datum; 
11.  Areas contributing drainage to the proposed subdivision shall be shown in the construction (i.e., engineering) plans; locations proposed for drainage discharge from the site shall be shown by directional arrows; 
12.  All physical features of the property to be subdivided shall be shown in the construction (i.e., engineering) plans, including the location and size of all water courses, 100-year flood plain according to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) information, Corps of Engineers flowage easement requirements, ravines, bridges, culverts, existing structures, drainage area in acres or area draining into subdivisions, the outline of major wooded areas or the location of major or important individual trees, and other features pertinent to subdivision; 
13.  Engineering construction plans of water and sewer lines and other infrastructure (including sizes) to be constructed in the subdivision; the proposed connections to distribution mains shall be indicated; 
14.  Where a subdivision is proposed to occur in phases, the subdivider, in conjunction with submission of the preliminary plat, shall provide a schedule of development; the dedication of rights-of-way for streets and street improvements, whether on-site or off-site, intended to serve each proposed phase of the subdivision; City staff shall determine whether the proposed streets and street improvements are adequate pursuant to standards herein established, and may require that a traffic impact analysis be submitted for the entire project or for such phases as the Council determines to be necessary to adjudge whether the subdivision will be served by adequate streets and thoroughfares; 
15.  All preliminary plats shall be submitted in a legible format on a good grade blue line or black line paper; 
16.  Proposed or existing zoning of the subject property and all adjacent properties; 
17.  The following City approval signature block, owner's acknowledgment block, and surveyor's certificate shall be placed in the lower right-hand corner of the page (above the title block) of each preliminary plat by the developer: 
City Approval of Preliminary Plat Approved for preparation of the final plat: __________Approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission Date __________Approved by the City Council Date Owner's Acknowledgment I hereby acknowledge this document as the officially approved preliminary plat: __________Owner's Signature Date Surveyor's Certificate KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That I, _______, do hereby certify that I prepared this plat from an actual and accurate survey of the land and that the corner monuments shown thereon as set were properly placed under my personal supervision in accordance with the Subdivision Ordinance of the City of Waxahachie.  
_____Registered Professional Land Surveyor  
j.  Engineering/Construction Plans. After preliminary plat application, the developer shall submit the required copies of the complete engineering construction plans of streets, alleys, storm sewers and drainage structures, water and sanitary sewer improvements, and any required screening walls/landscaping for the area covered by the preliminary plat. Cost estimates shall also be submitted with the construction plans. Three (3) sets of construction plans marked "approved" and a signed approval letter from the City must be on file at the City prior to construction commencement. A drainage plan showing how the drainage of each lot relates to the overall drainage plan for the plat under consideration shall be submitted with the construction plans. The drainage plan shall be made available to each builder within the proposed subdivision and all builders shall comply with the drainage plan. The developer shall have these plans prepared by their own professional engineers subject to approval of the plans by the City of Waxahachie. The City Manager (or designee) shall review or cause to be reviewed, the plans and specifications and if approved, shall mark them approved and return one set to the developer. If not approved, one set shall be marked with the objections noted and returned to the applicant or developer for correction. The subdivider shall provide additional sets of corrected engineering plans as specified by the City Manager for use during construction. City review and approval of the engineering construction plans shall not excuse the developer from compliance with these regulations if deficiencies are discovered during construction. 
After approval of the preliminary plat, construction plans and specifications by the City of Waxahachie, the developer shall cause a contractor to install the facilities in accordance with the approved plans and standard specifications of the City and at the developer's expense (also see Section 6). The developer shall employ engineers, surveyors and other professionals as necessary to design, stake and supervise the construction of such improvements, and shall cause his contractor to construct the said improvements in accordance with these regulations. 
Construction plans shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a professional engineer or architect registered in the State of Texas, as required by State law governing such professions and in accordance with this Ordinance and the Construction & Design (C & D) Manual. Construction plans submitted for review by the City shall be dated and shall bear the responsible engineer's registration number, and the designation of "professional engineer" or "P.E.", and the engineer's seal. Construction plans shall be approved by the City Manager (or designee) when such plans meet all of the requirements of this Ordinance and the C & D Manual. 
Engineering and construction plans shall be in conformance with the Construction & Design (C & D) Manual and the requirements set forth herein. Engineering construction plans showing paving and design details of streets, alleys, culverts, bridges, storm sewers, water mains, sanitary sewers, perimeter sidewalks, landscape plans (if appropriate), and other engineering details of the proposed subdivision at a scale of one inch equals forty (40) or fifty (50) feet horizontally and one inch equals four (4,) five (5), or ten (10) feet vertically shall be submitted to the Public Works Director (or designee) along with the preliminary plat of the subdivision. The number of copies as specified by the Public Works Director shall be submitted to the Public Works office. 
k.  Effect of Approval. Approval of a preliminary plat and construction plans authorizes the property owner, upon fulfillment of all requirements and conditions of approval, to commence construction of all required improvements (or submission of the proper assurances for construction of same, per Section 6), to submit an application for final plat approval. 
l.  Expiration of Plats and Reinstatement Procedure. 
1.  Unless extended under subsection (2), an approved preliminary plat application shall expire and shall thereafter be deemed null and void if a final plat application for all the land subject to the preliminary plat has not been approved within two (2) years from the date of the Council's approval of the preliminary plat. Subsequent expiration of the final plat shall also result in expiration of the preliminary plat for the same land. If the subdivision is to be developed in phases, and a phasing schedule has been approved with the preliminary plat, the final plat for the first phase must be approved within two (2) years from the date of approval of the preliminary plat by the City Council or in accordance with the phasing schedule. If the subdivider fails to receive approval of a final plat for any phase of the development within the prescribed period, the preliminary plat shall expire for that phase and for all other phases for which a final plat has not been approved or no longer remains in effect. Upon expiration, or upon denial of a timely submitted request for extension of plat approval, a new plat application shall be submitted, subject to requirements in effect at the time the application is filed with the City. 
The engineering construction plans shall also be valid as long as the preliminary plat is valid after approval of the plans by the City. 
2.  Prior to the lapse of approval of a preliminary plat, the property owner may petition the City to extend approval. Such petition shall be considered at a public meeting before the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, and an extension may be granted by the City Council at such public meeting. 
In determining whether to grant such a request, the City Council shall take into account the reasons for lapse, the ability of the property owner to comply with any conditions attached to the original approval, and the extent to which newly adopted subdivision regulations shall apply to the plat. The Commission and City Council shall extend the preliminary plat, or deny the request, in which instance the property owner must submit a new application for approval. 
The Commission and City Council may extend the approval for a specific time period, subject to additional conditions based upon newly enacted regulations, or such as are necessary to ensure compliance with the original conditions of approval. 
m.  Timing of Public Improvements. 
1.  The Commission and City Council may permit all or some of the public improvements to be installed, offered for dedication, and/or accepted by the City after approval of the final plat by the City. Also see Section 6. 
The City Council may permit or require the deferral of the construction of public improvements if, in its judgment, deferring the construction would not result in any harm to the public or would offer significant advantage in coordinating the site's development with adjacent properties and off-site public improvements. The deferred construction of any required public improvement(s) must be approved by the City at the time of preliminary plat approval, and the necessary assurances for completion of the improvements (in accordance with Section 6) shall be a stipulation (i.e., condition) of approval of the preliminary plat. 
2.  If the Commission and City Council do not require that all public improvements be installed, offered for dedication and/or accepted by the City prior to approval of the final plat, it shall require that the applicant provide assurances/security for the completion of the improvements, as provided in Section 6. 
n.  Remainder Tracts. 
1.  A remainder tract is that portion of a larger parcel that is not included within the boundaries of a preliminary plat. Remainder tracts shall not be considered lots or tracts of a proposed subdivision. Approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of development on a remainder tract. 
2.  Information accompanying a preliminary plat application for remainder tracts shall be deemed to be an aid to the commission or the council in taking action on the plat application and may be used to determine whether development of the land subject to the plat will be adequately served by public facilities and services and is otherwise in compliance with this Subdivision Ordinance, taking into account the future development of the property as a whole. Information concerning remainder tracts may be considered in formulating conditions to approval of the preliminary plat application. 
(Ord. No. 2229, § 2(C)-(F), 4-5-04; Ord. No. 2329, §§ 3, 4, 8-15-05) 
Section 2.4: - Procedures and Submission Requirements for Final Plat Approval. 
a.  The final plat shall be in accordance with the preliminary plat, as approved, and shall reflect/incorporate all applicable conditions, changes, directions and additions imposed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council upon the preliminary plat. The final plat shall not be approved by the City until all utilities, infrastructure, and other required improvements have been constructed according to the engineering/construction plans, as approved by the Public Works Director, unless provisions are made for the completion of the improvements in accordance with Section 6. The final plat shall not be submitted prior to approval of the preliminary plat (see Section 2.4 [c] for exception). At the time the developer files a final plat application with the City Manager (or designee), he shall also file a certificate showing that all taxes have been paid on the property to be subdivided, and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in accordance with Section 1.14. 
b.  The required number of copies of the proposed final plat shall be submitted at least twenty-eight (28) calendar days (but no more than thirty (30) calendar days, unless the applicant waives the 30-day review time in writing) before the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting at which it shall be considered, accompanied by an application form and an application fee (per the City's plat submission guidelines, as may be amended from time to time). The City Manager (or designee) shall check the plat to ascertain its compliance with these regulations and shall report to the applicant. If revisions are necessary, the applicant, developer or his engineer shall submit additional corrected copies of the properly completed final plat to the City Manager (or designee), along with a written request for a 30-day extension of the review period (thereby waiving the State-mandated 30-day review time for plats). If the written request for a 30-day extension is not submitted, then the plat will be recommended for denial. Failure to submit corrected copies back to the City in time shall be reason to determine the submittal as incomplete and as reason to not schedule the final plat on the Commission's agenda. The final plat application will thereupon be returned to the applicant with the reasons stated as to why the plat is incomplete. 
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the final plat within thirty (30) days of the official submission date (unless waived in writing by the applicant). The City Council shall take action within thirty (30) days of the Planning and Zoning Commission's action.

The Planning and Zoning Commission may, from time to time, exempt other development or land divisions from the requirements of this section. 
d.  Prohibition on Development. No development shall commence, nor shall any building permit, utility connection permit, electrical connection permit or similar permit be issued, for any development or land division subject to this section, until a development plat has been approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council and filed with the City Secretary. 
e.  Standards of Approval. The development plat shall not be approved until the following standards have been satisfied:

(Ord. No. 2229, § 2(C), 4-5-04) 
Section 2.7: - Replatting. 
a.  Replat Required. Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein, a property owner who proposes to replat any portion of an already approved final plat, other than to amend or vacate the plat, must first obtain approval for the replat under the same standards and by the same procedures prescribed for the final platting of land by these regulations. All improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the same requirements as for a preliminary or final plat, as provided herein. The City Manager (or designee) may waive or modify requirements for a land study and/or preliminary plat under circumstances where the previously approved land study or preliminary plat is sufficient to achieve the purposes set forth in this Ordinance. 
b.  Replatting Without Vacating Preceding Plat. A replat of a final plat or portion of a final plat may be recorded and is controlling over the preceding plat without vacation of that plat if the replat: 
1.  Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being replatted; 
2.  Is approved, after a public hearing on the matter at which parties in interest and citizens have an opportunity to be heard, by the City Council (no public hearing is required by the Planning and Zoning Commission); and 
3.  Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions previously incorporated in the final plat. 
c.  Previous Requirements or Conditions of Approval Which Are Still Valid. In addition to compliance with (b) above, a replat without vacation of the preceding plat must conform to the requirements of this section if: 
1.  During the preceding five (5) years, any of the area to be replatted was limited by an interim or permanent zoning classification to residential use for not more than two (2) residential units per lot; or

Notice of the public hearing shall also be given by written notice, with a copy of any requested waivers/suspensions, sent to the owners, as documented on the most recently approved ad valorem tax roll of the City, of lots that are in the original subdivision and that are within two hundred (200) feet of the lot(s) to be replatted. In the case of a subdivision in the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the most recently approved County tax roll shall be used. The written notice may be delivered by depositing the notice, properly addressed with postage prepaid, in a post office or postal depository within the boundaries of the City. 
e.  If the owners of twenty (20) percent or more of the owners of the area of lots to whom notice is required to be given under Subsection (b) above file with the City a written protest of the replatting before or at the public hearing, and if the replat requires a waiver/suspension as defined in Section 1.11, then approval of the replat will require the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the City Council members present. For a legal protest, written instruments signed by the owners of at least twenty (20) percent of the area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed replat and extending two hundred (200) feet from that area, but within the original subdivision, must be filed with the City prior to the close of the public hearing. In computing the percentage of land area subject to the "twenty-percent rule" described above, the area of streets and alleys shall be included. 
f.  Compliance with Subsection (e) above is not required for approval of a replat or part of a preceding plat if the area to be replatted was designated or reserved for other than single or duplex family residential use by notation on the last legally recorded plat or in the legally recorded restrictions applicable to the plat. 
g.  Any replat which adds or deletes lots must include the original subdivision and lot boundaries. If a replat is submitted for only a portion of a previously platted subdivision, the replat must reference the previous subdivision name and recording information, and must state on the replat the specific lots which have changed. 
h.  If the previous plat is vacated as prescribed in Section 212.013 of the Texas Local Government Code, a public hearing is not required for a replat of the area vacated. 
i.  The replat of the subdivision shall meet all the requirements for a final plat for a new subdivision that may be pertinent, as provided for herein. 
j.  The title shall identify the document as "___________ Addition, Block _____, Lot(s) _____, Being a Replat of Block _____, Lot(s) _____ of the ___________ Addition, an addition to the City of Waxahachie, Texas, as recorded in Volume/Cabinet _____, Page/Slide _____ of the Plat Records of Ellis County, Texas".

(Ord. No. 2229, § 2(C), 4-5-04) 
Section 2.9: - Plat Vacation. 
a.  By Property Owner. The property owner of the tract covered by a plat may vacate, upon the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, the plat at any time before any lot in the plat is sold. The plat is vacated when a signed, acknowledged instrument declaring the plat vacated is approved and recorded in the manner prescribed for the original plat.

The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall approve the petition for vacation on such terms and conditions as are in accordance with Section 212.013 of the Texas Local Government Code, and as are reasonable to protect the public health, safety and welfare.

d.  Effect of Action. On the execution and recording of the vacating instrument, the vacated plat shall have no effect. Regardless of the Planning and Zoning Commission's and City Council's action on the petition, the property owner or developer will have no right to a refund of any monies, fees or charges paid to the City nor to the return of any property or consideration dedicated or delivered to the City except as may have previously been agreed to by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. 
e.  City-Initiated Plat Vacation. 
1.  General Conditions. The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, on its motion, may vacate the plat of an approved subdivision or addition when: 
(a)  No lots within the approved plat have been sold within five (5) years from the date that the plat was signed by the City; 
(b)  The property owner has breached an improvement agreement and the City is unable to obtain funds with which to complete construction of public improvements, except that the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by property owner or its successor; or 
(c)  The plat has been of record for more than five (5) years and the City determines that the further sale of lots within the subdivision or addition presents a threat to public health, safety and/or welfare, except that the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by the property owner or its successors. 
2.  Procedure. Upon any consideration of the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council to vacate the plat of any previously approved subdivision or addition, in whole or in part, the City shall publish notice in the official City newspaper of general circulation, and shall also notify the property owner(s) within the boundaries of the plat proposed to be vacated. The notice shall state the time and place for a public hearing on the motion to vacate the subdivision or addition plat. The Commission shall recommend approval and the City Council shall approve the vacation only if the criteria and conditions cited above are satisfied. 
3.  Record of Notice. If the Commission and City Council approve vacating a plat, the City Secretary shall record a copy of the resolution or ordinance in the office of the County Clerk of Ellis County with a copy of the area or plat vacated. The County Clerk shall write legibly on the vacated plat the word "vacated" and shall enter on the plat a reference to the volume and page at which the vacating instrument is recorded. If the Commission and City Council adopt a resolution or ordinance vacating a plat in part, it shall cause a revised final plat to be recorded which shows that portion of the original plat that has been vacated and that portion that has not been vacated. On the execution and recording of the vacating instrument the vacated plat has no effect.

Proposed streets shall provide a safe, convenient and functional system for traffic circulation, and shall be properly related to the City's Thoroughfare Plan, road classification system, Comprehensive Plan and any amendments thereto, and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of each development. 
3.  Road Network. New subdivisions shall be supported by a road network having adequate capacity, and safe and efficient traffic circulation. The adequacy of the road network for developments of one hundred (100) or more dwelling units, or for developments generating one thousand (1,000) or more "one-way" trips per day, or for developments involving collector and/or arterial streets not appearing on the City's adopted Thoroughfare Plan, shall be demonstrated by preparation of a traffic impact analysis prepared in accordance with subsection (f), Traffic Impact Analysis, which takes into consideration the need to accommodate traffic generated by the development, land to be developed in common ownership and other developed property. In the event that the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a larger development project, or constitutes a portion of the land to be ultimately developed, the City may require a demonstration of adequacy pursuant to this section for additional phases or portions of the property as a condition of approval for the proposed plat. In the event that the applicant submits a traffic impact analysis for an entire phased development project, the City may require an update of the study for later phases of the development. 
4.  Approach Roads and Access. All subdivisions must be connected to the City's improved thoroughfare and street system by one or more approach roads of such dimensions and approved to such standards as are hereinafter set forth. Requirements for dedication of right-of-way and improvement of approach roads may be increased depending on the density or intensity of the proposed development, if such need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis. 
(a)  The subdivision shall be designed to provide adequate emergency access for public safety vehicles. Each residential lot in the subdivision shall have a minimum frontage on a dedicated street as required by applicable zoning (or if no such requirement exists, minimum frontage of thirty-five (35) feet, unless other provisions have been authorized through planned development approval. 
5.  Off-Site Improvements. Where traffic impact analysis demonstrates the need for such facilities, the property owner shall make such improvements to off-site collector and arterial streets and intersections as are necessary to mitigate traffic impacts generated by the development or related developments. The City may participate in the costs of oversize improvements with the subdivider (pursuant to Ordinance No. 1479, adopted on August 19, 1985, as may be amended). 
6.  Street Dedications. 
(a)  Dedication of Right-of-Way and Road Improvements. The property owner shall provide all rights-of-way required for existing or future streets, and for all required street improvements, including perimeter streets and approach roads, as shown in the Thoroughfare Plan or other valid development plans approved by City Council. In the case of perimeter streets, half of the total required right-of-way for such streets shall be provided. However, in some instances more than half shall be required when a half street is impractical or unsafe and depending on the actual or proposed alignment of the street, as may be required by the City Council. 
If the owner or subdivider is responsible for one-half (1/2) of the street, then the owner or subdivider shall either construct or provide escrow for the construction cost of the facility unless the City participates in the construction of the facility. Whenever a partial street has been previously platted along a common property line, the other portion of the street (i.e., whatever amount of right-of-way that will bring the street up to its standard width) shall be dedicated. Improvements shall be made to all on-site facilities as defined herein (see Definitions, Section 1.17). 
(b)  Perimeter Streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision or addition, the other half of the street shall be dedicated and improved by the developer of the subdivision or addition. 
(c)  Slope Easements. The dedication of easements, in addition to dedicated rights-of-way shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall be in excess of three (3) feet horizontal to one foot vertical. 
7.  Street Construction. All streets and thoroughfares shall be constructed to City standards and in rights-of-way as required by the Thoroughfare Plan, in accordance with the C & D Manual and/or other City standards as may be from time to time adopted. 
8.  Intersection improvements and traffic control devices shall be installed as warranted in accordance with the traffic impact analysis required by subsection (f). Construction and design standards shall be in accordance with City standards and the C & D Manual. 
9.  Phased Development. Where a subdivision is proposed to occur in phases, the subdivider, in conjunction with submission of the preliminary plat, shall provide a schedule of development. The schedule shall set forth the intended plan of development and dedication of rights-of-way for streets and street improvements, whether on-site or off-site, intended to serve each proposed phase of the subdivision. The Council shall determine whether the proposed streets and street improvements are adequate pursuant to standards herein established and may require that a traffic impact analysis be submitted for the entire project or such phases as the Council determined to be necessary to adjudge whether the subdivision will be served by adequate streets and thoroughfares. 
10.  Private Streets. All private streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the City's standards for publicly dedicated streets. The term "private street" shall be inclusive of alleys, if such are to be provided within the subdivision. 
(a)  Subdivision Eligibility Criteria. Private streets shall be permitted only within a subdivision satisfying each of the following criteria: 
(1)  The subdivision shall have no fewer than fifty (50) residential lots; 
(2)  The streets to be restricted to private use are not intended for regional or local through traffic circulation (see subsection 3.1c.10.(b) below); 
(3)  The subdivision is located in an area that is surrounded on at least three (3) sides (i.e., seventy-five (75) percent of the perimeter) by natural barriers (e.g., creeks and flood plains) or similar barriers (e.g., golf course or linear park) created by man (non-qualifying barriers include screening walls, roadways, man-made drainage ditches or berms, utility easements and rights-of-way); 
(4)  The subdivision is not located adjacent to an existing or approved public street subdivision that can be reasonably connected, even though the street connection would require construction of a bridge or culvert - the two (2) subdivisions shall be connected as public street subdivisions; 
(5)  A mandatory property (homeowners) association, which includes all property to be served by the private streets, will be formed (see subsection 3.1c.10.(e) below); and 
(6)  The subdivision conforms to any other special guidelines for private street developments as may be approved separately by the City Council. 
(b)  Streets Excluded. Streets that are shown on the City's Thoroughfare Plan as collectors (Types "D-1", "D-2", "E-1" or "E-2") or arterials (Types "A", "B" or "C") shall not be used, maintained or constructed as private streets, and a private street subdivision shall not cross or interfere with an existing or future collector or arterial street. Also, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council may deny the creation of any other private street if, in their sole judgment, the private street would negatively affect traffic circulation on public streets, or if it would impair access to the subject or adjacent property; impair access to or from public facilities including schools or parks; or if it would cause possible delays in the response time of emergency vehicles. 
(c)  Access Onto Public Thoroughfare. A private street subdivision shall provide a minimum of seventy (70) feet of access frontage on a public collector or arterial street for subdivision entrances - primary access into a private street subdivision shall be from a collector (Type "D-1" or "D-2") or larger roadway, as shown on the City's Thoroughfare Plan. Restricted access entrances shall not be allowed from minor collectors (Type "E-1" or "E-2"), minor residential/local streets (Type "F"), or from alleys. No more than two (2) gated street entrances may intersect a thoroughfare (Type "E-2" or larger) within any one-mile segment. 
(d)  Parks and Greenbelts Excluded. A private street subdivision shall not cross or interfere with an existing or future public pedestrian pathway, hike and bike trail, greenbelt or park as shown on the City of Waxahachie's Parks, Recreation & Open Space Master Plan. 
(e)  Property (Homeowners) Association Required. Subdivisions developed with private streets shall have a mandatory property owners association which includes all property served by the private streets. The association shall own and be responsible for the maintenance of private streets and appurtenances. The association documents must establish a reserve fund for the maintenance of streets and other improvements. The association documents shall be reviewed and approved by the City Attorney to ensure that they conform to this and other applicable City rules and regulations. The documents shall be filed of record prior to final plat approval. Lot deeds must convey membership in the association, and must provide for the payment of dues and assessments required by the association. The association may not be dissolved without the prior written consent of the City Council. No portion of the association documents pertaining to the maintenance of private streets and alleys, and assessments therefore, may be amended without the written consent of the City Council. 
(f)  Private Street Lot. Private streets must be constructed within a separate lot owned by the property owners association. This lot must conform to the City's standards for public street rights-of-way. An easement covering the street lot shall be granted to the City providing unrestricted access to and use of the property for any purpose deemed necessary by the City. This right shall also extend to all utility providers operating within the City. The easement shall also permit the City to remove any vehicle or obstacle within the street lot that may impair emergency access. 
(g)  Construction and Maintenance Cost. The City shall not pay for any portion of the cost of constructing or maintaining a private street. 
(h)  Infrastructure/Utilities. All water, sewer and drainage facilities, street lights, and traffic control devices (e.g., signs) placed within the private street lot shall be installed to City standards, and shall be dedicated to the City prior to filing the record plat for the subdivision. All private traffic control devices and regulatory signs shall conform to the "Texas Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices". All City regulations relating to infrastructure financing, developer cost participation, and capital cost recovery shall apply to developments with private streets. 
The metering for utilities such as water, gas and electricity shall be located on the individual lots to be served, not grouped together in a single (or multiple) centralized location (i.e., no centralized "gang-box" style metering stations). 
(i)  Plans and Inspections. Development applications for subdivisions with private streets must include the same plans and engineering information required for public streets and utilities. City requirements pertaining to inspection and approval of improvements shall apply, and fees charged for these services shall also apply. The City may periodically inspect private streets, and may require any repairs necessary to ensure efficient emergency access and/or to protect the public health, safety, convenience and welfare. 
(j)  Restricted Access. The entrances to all private streets must be clearly marked with a sign, placed in a prominent and visible location, stating that the streets within the subdivision are private, and that they are not maintained by the City. Guard houses, access control gates, and cross arms, if used, shall be constructed per subsection (k) below. All restricted access entrances must be manned twenty-four (24) hours every day, or they must provide an alternative means of ensuring access to the subdivision (preferably with an Opticom-type system for emergency access) by the City and other utility or public service providers (e.g., postal carriers, utility companies, etc.) with appropriate identification. If the association fails to maintain reliable access as required herein, the City may enter the subdivision and remove any gate or device which is a barrier to access at the sole expense of the association. The association documents shall contain provisions in conformity with this Section which may not be amended without the written consent of the City Council. 
(k)  Access Restricted Entrance Design Standards. Any private street which has an access control gate or cross arm must have a minimum uninterrupted pavement width of twenty-two (22) feet at the location of the gate or access control device (both ingress and egress) regardless of the type of device used. If an overhead (e.g., lift-up) barrier is used, it must be a minimum of fourteen (14) feet in height above the road surface, and this clearance height shall be extended for a minimum distance of fifty (50) feet in front of and behind the location of the device. All gates and cross arms must be of a break-away design. A minimum vehicle stacking distance of one hundred (100) feet shall be provided from the right-of-way line of the public road from which the private street subdivision is accessed to the first vehicle stopping point, which is usually an access request keypad/telephone or guard's window. Adequate distance shall be provided between the access request point(s) and the entry barrier (e.g., gate) to accommodate a vehicle turn-around as described below. 
A paved turn-around space must be located in front of any restricted access entrance barrier (i.e., between the access request device and the barrier/gate) to allow vehicles that are denied access to safely exit onto public streets without having to back up (particularly into the public street upon which the entrance is located). The design and geometry (i.e., pavement width, inside radius, etc.) of such turn-around shall be such that it will accommodate smooth, single-motion U-turn movements by the following types of vehicles: 
(1)  Larger passenger vehicles (e.g., vans, pick-up trucks, etc.); 
(2)  Passenger vehicles with short trailers up to twenty-four (24) feet in length (e.g., small flatbed, camping or box-type trailers); and 
(3)  The types of service and utility trucks that typically visit or make deliveries to neighborhoods that are similar to the proposed private street development (e.g., utility company vehicles, postal/UPS delivery trucks, two- to three-axle flatbed or box-type trucks used by contractors and moving companies, etc.). 
City staff, the Planning and Zoning Commission, and/or City Council may require submission of additional drawings, plans and/or exhibits demonstrating that the proposed turn-around will work and that vehicle turn-around movements will not compromise public safety on the entry roadway or on the adjacent public street(s). The design of all proposed access restricted entrances (i.e., a site plan) must be submitted for review by the Public Works Director, Police Department and Fire Department along with the construction plans for the subdivision, and must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to construction and approval of the final plat. 
(l)  Waiver of Services. The subdivision final plat, property deeds and property owners association documents shall note that certain City services shall not be provided for private street subdivisions. Among the services which will not be provided are: routine law enforcement patrols, enforcement of traffic and parking regulations, and preparation of accident reports. Depending upon the characteristics of the development and upon access limitations posed by the design of entrances into the subdivision, other services (such as sanitation) may not be provided. 
(m)  Petition to Convert to Public Streets. The property owners association documents shall allow the association to petition the City to accept private streets and any associated property as public streets and right-of-way upon written notice to all association members and upon the favorable vote of a majority of the membership. However, in no event shall the City be obligated to accept said streets as public. Should the City elect to accept the streets as public, then the City has the right to inspect the private streets and to assess the lot owners for the expense of needed repairs concurrent with the City's acceptance of the streets. The City shall be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed. The City may also require, at the association's expense, the removal of any guard houses, access control devices, landscaping and/or other aesthetic amenities located within the street lot. The association documents shall provide for the City's right to such removal and assessment. Those portions of the association documents pertaining to the subject matter contained in this Section shall not be amended without the written consent of the City. 
(n)  Hold Harmless. On the subdivision final plat shall be language whereby the property owners association, as owner of the private streets and appurtenances, agrees to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, any other governmental entity, and any public utility entity for damages to the private streets that may be occasioned by the reasonable use of the private streets by same, and for damages and injury (including death) arising from the condition of the private streets, out of any use of access gates or cross arms, or out of any use of the subdivision by the City or governmental/utility entity. 
d.  Escrow Policies and Procedures. 
1.  Request for Escrow. Whenever these regulations require a property owner to construct (including design, engineering and construction) a street or thoroughfare (or other type of public improvement), the property owner may petition the City to construct the street or thoroughfare in exchange for deposit of escrow as established in this section. If the property owner requests escrow in lieu of constructing more than one street or thoroughfare required to meet adequacy standards for roadways, the City may establish separate escrow accounts for such affected roadways, or may determine that some roadways should be constructed, while escrow should be accepted from others. The City Manager (or designee) shall advise the City Council whether escrow is to be accepted in lieu of the obligation to construct a street or thoroughfare. 
2.  Deposit With the City. Whenever the City agrees to accept escrow deposits in lieu of construction by the owner of the property under these regulations, the property owner or developer shall deposit an amount equal to his share of the costs of design and construction in escrow with the City. Such amount shall be paid prior to release of construction plans by the City. The obligations and responsibilities of the property owner shall become those of property owner's transferees, successors and assigns; and the liability therefore shall be joint and several. 
3.  Determination of Escrow Amount. The amount of the escrow shall be determined by the City Manager using the average of several comparable bids that were awarded by the City in the preceding six (6) months or, if none exist, then in the preceding year or, if none exist, by using current costs of construction (including engineering design fees, contingencies, administrative fees, and related costs) as determined by an estimate by the City. Such determination shall be made as of the time the escrow is due hereunder. 
4.  Termination of Escrow. Escrows which have been placed with the City under this section which have been held for a period of ten (10) years from the date of such payment or agreement, in the event that the City has not authorized the preparation of plans and specifications for construction of such roadway facilities for which the escrow was made, shall upon written request be returned to the property owner, with accrued interest. 
5.  Refund. If any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed by a party other than the City, or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no cost to the City, the escrowed funds and accrued interest shall be refunded to the property owner or developer who originally paid the escrow amount after completion and acceptance of the public improvements. In the event that a portion of the cost is borne by the City and the other portion of the cost by another party or governmental authority, the difference between the owner's actual proportionate cost and the escrowed funds, including accrued interest, if any, shall be refunded after completion and acceptance of the improvements. 
6.  Interest Limitation. If money is refunded within six (6) months of deposit, only the principal will be refunded. Monies returned after this date will be refunded with interest accrued, calculated at one percent less than the rate of actual earnings. 
e.  Any land study or plat involving a significant change to a proposed roadway alignment from that shown on the City of Waxahachie's Thoroughfare Plan must be preceded by submission and approval of a traffic impact analysis as specified in subsection f. below. Failure to provide for such approval prior to submission of a land study or plat shall be grounds for automatic denial. 
f.  Traffic Impact Analysis. Whenever these regulations require a traffic impact analysis, the following elements shall be included: 
1.  General Site Description. The traffic impact analysis shall include a detailed description of the roadway network within one mile of the site, a description of the proposed land uses, the anticipated states of construction, and the anticipated completion date of the proposed land development shall be provided. This description which may be in the form of a map, shall include the following items: (1) all major intersections; (2) all proposed and existing ingress and egress locations; (3) all existing roadway widths and rights-of-way; (4) all existing traffic signals and traffic-control devices; and (5) all existing and proposed public transportation services and facilities within a one-mile radius of the site. 
2.  Proposed Capital Improvements. The traffic impact analysis shall identify any changes to the roadway network within one mile of the site that are proposed by any government agency or other developer. This description shall include the above items as well as any proposed construction project that would alter the width and/or alignment of roadways affected by the proposed development. 
3.  Roadway Impact Analysis. 
(a)  Transportation Impacts: 
(1)  Trip Generation. The average weekday trip generation rates (trip ends), the average weekend trip generation rates (uses other than residential or institutional), the highest average a.m. and p.m. hourly weekday trip generation rates, and the highest hourly weekend generation rates (uses other than residential or institutional) for the proposed use shall be determined based upon the trip generation rates contained in the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation Manual; or shall be based upon data generated by actual field surveys of area uses compatible to the proposed use and approved by the Public Works Director of the City of Waxahachie. 
(2)  Trip Distribution. The distribution of trips to arterial and collector roadways within the study area identified in subsection 3.1f.1 (General Site Description) above shall be in conformity with accepted traffic engineering principles, taking into consideration the land use categories of the proposed development; the area from which the proposed development will attract traffic; competing developments (if applicable); the size of the proposed development; development phasing; surrounding existing and anticipated land uses, population and employment; existing and projected daily traffic volumes; and existing traffic conditions identified pursuant to subsection 3.1f.1 above. 
(b)  Adequacy Determination. The roadway network included within the traffic impact analysis shall be considered adequate to serve the proposed development if existing roadways identified as arterials and collectors can accommodate the existing service volume, and the service volume of the proposed development, and the service volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid, unexpired building permits at a level of service "C" or above. 
4.  Intersection Analysis. 
(a)  Level of Service Analysis. For intersections within the roadway traffic impact analysis area described in subsection 3.1f.1 herein, a level of service analysis shall be performed for all arterial/arterial, arterial/collector, collector/collector intersections and other intersections identified by City staff. Also, level of service analyses will be required on all proposed site driveway locations for all non-residential developments. The City may waive analysis of minor intersections and site driveway locations within the one-mile radius. The level of service analysis shall be based upon the highest hourly average a.m. or p.m. peak weekday volume or highest average hourly peak weekend volume as determined from a two-day survey of weekday volumes and, where necessary, a one-day survey of weekend volumes. The level of service analysis shall take into consideration the lane geometry, traffic volume, percentage of right-hand turns, percentage of left-hand turns, percentage of trucks, intersection width, number of lanes, signal timing and progression, roadway grades, pedestrian and bicycle flows, school routes, number of accidents, and peak hour factor. 
(b)  Adequacy Analysis. The intersections included within the traffic impact analysis shall be considered adequate to serve the proposed development if existing intersections can accommodate the existing service volume, the service volume of the proposed development, and the service volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid, unexpired building permits at level of service "C" or above. 
5.  Effect of Adequacy Determination. If the adequacy determination for roadways and intersections indicates that the proposed development would cause a reduction in the level of service for any roadway or intersection within the study area identified in subsection 3.1.f.1 herein that would cause the roadway to fall below the level of service required hereto, the proposed development shall be denied unless the developer agrees to one of the following conditions: 
(a)  The deferral of building permits until the improvements necessary to upgrade the substandard facilities are constructed; 
(b)  A reduction in the density or intensity of development; 
(c)  The dedication or construction of facilities needed to achieve the level of service required herein; or 
(d)  Any combination of techniques identified herein that would ensure that development will not occur unless the levels of service for all roadways and intersections within the traffic impact analysis study are adequate to accommodate the impacts of such development. 
g.  Arrangement of Streets Not Shown on the Thoroughfare Plan. For streets that are not shown on the City's Thoroughfare Plan (e.g., local residential streets), the arrangement of such streets within a subdivision shall: 
1.  Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets from or into surrounding areas; 
2.  Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the City to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformity to existing streets impractical; 
3.  Provide for future access (i.e., provide stubbed streets for future extension) to adjacent vacant areas which will likely develop under a similar zoning classification; 
4.  Not conflict in any way with existing or proposed driveway openings. 
h.  Minor residential streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged, but access is provided to adjacent subdivisions. 
i.  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the City may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage (lots which back onto the arterial), deep lots with rear service alleys, or such treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection to residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
j.  Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is definitely placed by the City under conditions approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. 
k.  Intersecting, undivided streets with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided. Intersecting streets onto a divided roadway must be configured such that the centerline offset will accommodate the appropriate left-turn lanes (with required transition and stacking distances) onto each of the two (2) intersecting streets. 
l.  Major thoroughfare intersections shall be at ninety-degree angles and tangent to the intersecting street for at least fifty (50) feet. Other street intersections shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect at less than eighty (80) degrees. 
m.  Street right-of-way widths shall be as shown on the Thoroughfare Plan, and where not shown therein shall be as shown in the C & D Manual. For subdivisions in which all lots that are thirty-six thousand (36,000) square feet in area or larger, the City may approve rural type construction design (i.e., without curb and gutter) for residential streets only, based upon a recommendation from the Public Works Director. 
n.  Construction of half streets shall be prohibited, except when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conforming with the other requirements of these regulations and the Thoroughfare Plan, and where the City makes a determination that there is no immediate benefit to be gained by constructing the full street section since no access from the street will be needed by the subdivision in question. The City may also find that it would be more practical (and/or cost effective) to delay construction of the other half of a street when the adjoining property is developed. 
o.  The maximum length of any block or street segment shall be one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet, as measured along the street centerline and between the point(s) of intersection with other through (i.e., not dead-end or cul-de-sac) streets. 
p.  a.  Residential streets with sixty (60) feet of right-of-way or less, excluding collector streets, shall not exceed a maximum length of six hundred (600) feet measured from the major thoroughfare right-of-way, and one thousand four hundred (1,400) feet for all other residential streets that do not intersect a major thoroughfare without one or more of the following design elements: 
1.  A curve radius of two hundred (250) feet. Tangent between reverse curves shall be a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet. A one hundred fifty (150) foot offset shall be provided within the street when reverse curves are used. See Diagram 1. 

2.  An offset within the street between ninety (90) to one hundred twenty (120) degrees. Minimum offset between reverse offsets shall be one hundred fifty (150) feet. See Diagram 2. 

b.  Residential streets may extend to two thousand (2,000) feet without an offset when one of the following is provided: 
1.  A street design with twenty-two (22) foot wide travel section with parking cut-outs that are eight (8) feet wide and eighty eight (88) feet long with a tree island between the parking cut-outs that measure twenty (20) feet long and eight (8) feet wide. Parking cutouts shall be offset from parking cutouts on the opposite of the street. A three (3) inch caliper tree shall be planted in each tree island. This option is not available for front entry product(s). Front entry product is prohibited on this street. See Diagram 3. 

2.  Block lengths not to exceed seven hundred (700) feet with sixty (60) feet of right-of-way with twenty-seven (27) feet of residential street pavement and three (3) inch caliper tree provided in front of each residential lot between the curb and the sidewalk. This tree is in addition to the tree(s) required on a residential lot. The tree shall be installed before the Certificate of Occupancy of the house. The number of 7-6 cul-de-sacs intersecting this street is limited to twenty-five (25) percent. See Diagram 1 below. 
c.  A minimum three (3) inch caliper tree shall be used when trees are required by this Section. These trees shall be mechanically irrigated with a bubbler system or other approved irrigation system that minimizes water run-off and evaporation. Root barriers as approved by the City's landscape architect shall be installed with each tree. The homeowner shall be responsible for the irrigation and maintenance of the trees. 
d.  A collector street may exceed one thousand four hundred (1,400) feet provided that no residential lots front the collector street, and the collector street shall not have any straight sections exceeding one thousand (1,000) feet. 
e.  Divided roadways are excluded from the street length requirement. 
q.  The Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council may approve waivers/suspensions for overlength streets and/or cul-de-sacs upon consideration of the following: 
(a)  Alternative designs which would reduce street/cul-de-sac length; 
(b)  The effect of overlength streets upon access, congestion, delivery of municipal services, and upon convenience to residents of the subdivision in traveling to and from their homes; and 
(c)  Means of mitigation, including but not limited to additional mid-block street connections, limitation on the number of lots to be served along an overlength street segment or cul-de-sac, temporary (or permanent) points of emergency access, and additional fire protection measures. 
r.  Except in unusual cases, no dead-end streets will be approved unless such dead-end streets are provided to connect with future streets on adjacent land. In the case of dead-end streets which will eventually be extended into the adjacent subdivision, no more than one lot (per side) can front onto the dead-end street stub unless a temporary turn-around bulb (with an off-site easement, if necessary) is provided at the end. A dead-end street shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length, and the temporary turn-around bulb must be constructed like a cul-de-sac, as provided in subsection (p) above (the Public Works Director may authorize the use of asphalt or other durable paving material than concrete for the arc portions of the temporary turn-around bulb in order to minimize the cost of removing those portions later on). A note shall be placed on the final plat clearly labeling any dead-end streets (if any) that will at some point be extended into the adjacent property, and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street stub (on the barricade) also stating that the street will be extended in the future. 
s.  New streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets, and shall be dedicated at equal or greater right-of-way widths than the existing streets. 
t.  Construction of New Streets. All new streets dedicated within a subdivision shall be constructed in accordance with paving widths and specifications as set forth in the C & D Manual of the City of Waxahachie at the time at which the final plat is approved, and crosswalks and barrier-free ramps shall be provided and designed in accordance with ADA requirements. 
u.  Points of Access. All subdivisions shall have at least two (2) points of access from improved public roadways. The two (2) points of access can be from a single entrance onto a public thoroughfare if the thoroughfare is divided, and if the entry into the subdivision is also divided. Otherwise, the two (2) points of access shall be from two (2) different entrances either on a single public thoroughfare or on two (2) public thoroughfares. All residential developments shall provide no less than one entrance for every one hundred (100) lots, or portion thereof, including dead-end stubbed streets that will eventually provide connections into adjacent future developments and thence to an existing arterial or collector street. Subdivisions with four hundred (400) or more lots may submit a traffic impact analysis showing that additional entrances are not needed for future traffic generation levels. Based upon recommendations of the traffic impact analysis, the Public Works Director may waive the requirement for additional entrances into the subdivision. 
v.  Streets will be constructed in accordance to the C & D Manual that is in effect at the time of subdivision construction.

a.  Alleys shall be optional in commercial and industrial districts. Service alleys in commercial and industrial districts shall be designed in accordance with the C & D Manual. 
b.  Residential alleys shall not be required except to connect to a subdivision with existing alleys for the purpose of providing continuity. If alleys are constructed or required, the following standards shall be met: 
1.  In residential districts, alleys shall be parallel, or approximately parallel, to the frontage of the street. Alleys in residential districts shall be designed in accordance with the C & D Manual. 
2.  Alleys shall be paved in accordance with the City of Waxahachie C & D Manual that is in effect at the time of subdivision construction. 
3.  Where the deflection of alley alignment occurs, the design of the paving and property line shall be as established by the C & D Manual. 
4.  Dead-end or "hammerhead" alleys shall not be allowed. Alleys must have adequate turnouts and street entrances such that vehicular traffic flow is continuous and efficient. Where a temporary dead-end alley situation is unavoidable, a temporary turn-around bulb or turnout onto a street (either of which will need a temporary easement for street/alley purposes) shall be provided as determined by the Public Works Director. 
5.  Alleys may not exceed a maximum length of one thousand two hundred feet (1,200'), as measured along the centerline of the alley and between intersections with other alleys or entrances onto streets (at the right-of-way line of the street at the alley entrance). The Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council may approve waivers/suspensions for overlength alleys upon consideration of the following: 
(a)  Alternative designs which would reduce alley length; 
(b)  The effect of overlength alleys upon access, congestion, delivery of municipal services, and upon convenience to residents of the subdivision in accessing rear driveways and in driving around to the front of their homes; and 
(c)  Means of mitigation, including but not limited to additional mid-block alley turnouts, limitation on the number of lots to be served along a single alley segment, temporary points of access, and additional fire protection measures. 
Section 3.3: - Easements. 
a.  Easements across lots or centered along rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary, and shall be of such widths as may be reasonably necessary for the utility or utilities using same. A minimum utility easement fifteen (15) feet wide or wider, as determined by the Public Works Director, or any applicable utility company on both sides of the street adjacent to all street rights-of-way shall be provided for gas, electric, and other utilities approved by the City. It shall be the subdivider's responsibility to determine appropriate easement widths as required by other utility companies. (Also see Section 3.8) All easements shall be accessible by the City and/or by other applicable utility companies, and accessibility shall be in conformance with the City's (and/or the other utility company's) policies regarding same. 
b.  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, or channel, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with such course and of such additional width as may be designated by the City Manager (or designee), subject to determination according to proper engineering considerations. The required width shall conform to the requirements set forth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Parallel streets or parkways may be required adjacent to certain portions of creek or drainageways to provide maintenance access or access to recreation areas (see Section 4). City approved utilities are permitted within the drainage easement. 
c.  A lot area shall be computed inclusive of all easements. There shall be a minimum buildable area, exclusive of easements, for each lot. The minimum buildable area shall be an area one-half (1/2) of the required minimum lot size. If the City disputes the buildable area of any lot, the subdivider shall submit in writing that the buildable area is adequate. 
d.  Where alleys are not provided in a residential subdivision, a minimum ten-foot wide utility easement shall be provided along the front of all lots, adjacent to and flush with the street right-of-way line for the potential placement of utility facilities. 
e.  For new development, all necessary on-site easements shall be established on the subdivision plat and not by separate instrument, and they shall be labeled for the specific purpose, and to the specific entity, for which they are being provided. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: a water, sanitary sewer or drainage easement, which is dedicated to the City for a water or sanitary sewer line or for a drainage structure; an access easement, which is dedicated to the public for unrestricted access purposes; a fire lane easement, which is dedicated to the City for emergency access purposes; an electrical, gas, telephone or cable television easement, which is dedicated to the specific utility provider that requires the easement; and so on. 
Section 3.4: - Blocks. 
a.  The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
1.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated. 
2.  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes, setbacks and dimensions. 
3.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. 
b.  In general, intersecting streets, determining the block lengths and widths shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately, to provide adequate fire protection and to meet existing streets' or customary subdivision practices. Where no subdivision control, the blocks shall not exceed one thousand two hundred feet (1,200') for Single-Family-1 zoning districts and eight hundred feet (800') for all other zoning districts. 
( Ord. No. 2750, 7-7-14 ) 
Section 3.5: - Sidewalks. 
a.  Pedestrian concrete sidewalks not less than five feet (5') wide shall be provided within all residential subdivisions and sidewalks not less than six feet (6') shall be provided within all non-residential developments. Sidewalks not less than eight feet (8') wide shall be provided along all perimeter roadways (residential and non-residential) as set forth in the City of Waxahachie C&D Manual. Sidewalks shall be constructed within the street right-of-way, two and one-half feet (2.5') away from the right of way line and at least four feet (4') away from the street curb, and in accordance with the C &D Manual. Sidewalks shall be installed before the final building inspection by the City. A Certificate of Occupancy will not be issued until the sidewalk is in place. Sidewalks along perimeter streets shall be installed prior to subdivision acceptance. 
b.  The cost and provision of any perimeter sidewalks (i.e., along major thoroughfares) may be escrowed as a part of a developers agreement, if approved by the City Manager. The City has the right, but not the obligation, to refuse escrow and to require paving of the sidewalks if, in its sole opinion, immediate provision of the sidewalks is necessary for safe pedestrian circulation or if it would otherwise protect the public health, safety or welfare. 
c.  Sidewalks, barrier-free ramps and pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided and designed in accordance with ADA requirements. 
d.  For subdivisions with all lots thirty-six thousand (36,000) square feet in area and larger, sidewalks are not required on residential (i.e., local) streets only. However, sidewalks shall be required on collector and larger-sized streets, and on any residential/local street(s) the City deems necessary in the interest of public safety. For example, a street that will serve as a primary route for children to walk or bicycle to a neighborhood park or school shall be required to have sidewalks on one or both sides, as the City deems appropriate. 
( Ord. No. 2750, 7-7-14 ) 
Section 3.6: - Lots 
a.  Lots shall conform to the minimum requirements of the established zoning district. 
b.  Each lot shall front onto a dedicated, improved public street. Lot width and access shall conform with the provisions of the City of Waxahachie's Thoroughfare Plan. Lot access onto arterial and collector streets is subject to approval by the City Manager (or designee) and/or the Public Works Director, either of whom may require a traffic study or other data/information prior to approval of the preliminary plat in order to fully study all access issues. In all cases, lots shall have a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet of frontage along a dedicated, improved street. 
c.  Irregular-shaped lots shall have sufficient width at the building line to meet lot width and frontage requirements of the appropriate zoning district. Also, the rear width shall be sufficient to provide access for all necessary utilities, including garbage collection when alleys are present. 
d.  Side lot lines shall be generally at right angles or radial to street lines. 
e.  Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where they may be essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials as defined in Section 3.1 or to overcome specific disadvantage to topography and orientation. Where lots have double frontage, building setback lines shall be established for each street side. Screening shall be provided in accordance with Section 5.7. 
f.  Double frontage lots in residential subdivisions will not be allowed without providing appropriate screening, in accordance with Section 5.7. 
Section 3.7: - Building Lines. 
    Front and street side building lines shall be shown on the preliminary and final plat for all lots having street frontage, and shall be consistent with the Zoning Ordinance requirements for the district in which the development is located. 
Section 3.8: - Utility Services (not provided by the City of Waxahachie). 
a.  For purposes of this section, the following meanings shall apply: 
1.  "Utility services" - The facilities of any person, firm or corporation providing electric, telephone, cable television, water service, or any other such item or service for public use approved but not provided by the City of Waxahachie. 
2.  "Feeder or feeder/lateral line" - High voltage supply electric lines carrying more than 69,000 volts that emanate from substations used to distribute power through an area to an unspecified number of customers. 
3.  "Lateral lines" - Those electric or telephone lines used to distribute power from a feeder line to a single subdivision. These electric lines are normally connected to a feeder line through a sectionalizing device such as a fuse. 
4.  "Service lines" - Those electric lines used to connect between the utilities' supply system or lateral lines and the end users meter box. 
b.  All subdivision plats and construction plans filed with and submitted to the City of Waxahachie for approval shall provide for utility services such as electrical, gas, telephone and cable TV utility (lateral and/or service distribution) lines and wires to be placed underground. Feeder and other major transmission lines may remain overhead within the appropriate easements. However, a subdivider shall endeavor and, whenever practical, the City shall require that feeder lines are placed away from traffic arteries (Thoroughfare Types "A" and "B", Section 3.1). Whenever practical, feeder lines which are to be placed overhead shall not be placed along both sides of the street right-of-way. Verification of acceptance of easement locations and widths by the public utilities shall be provided prior to final plat approval by the City Council, and all easements shall be reviewed by the utility companies and Public Works Director for the City prior to granting final approval for all residential subdivisions affected by this section. 
c.  Each of the utility companies shall be responsible for developing administrative policies, criteria for easement size, and cost reimbursement procedures for the installation and extension of their underground utilities. Nothing herein shall prohibit or restrict any utility company from recovering the difference in cost of overhead facilities and underground utilities from the owner or developer in accordance with the provisions of such utility's approved tariff. No utility company shall be required or permitted to begin construction of underground facilities unless and until the owner or developer of the subdivision has made arrangements satisfactory to the specific utility company for the payment of such difference between the cost of overhead facilities and underground facilities. 
d.  All electrical and telephone support equipment, including transformers, amplifiers, and switching devices necessary for underground installations, shall be pad-mounted or mounted underground, but not overhead (unless the subdivision is served from perimeter overhead electrical facilities). 
e.  Temporary construction service may be provided by overhead electric lines and facilities without obtaining a waiver/suspension or exception, provided that when the underground utility service to any portion of a subdivision is completed, such overhead electric lines and facilities are promptly removed. 
f.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any existing facilities in place prior to the effective date of this Ordinance to be placed underground. 
Section 3.9: - Water and Wastewater Facility Design. 
a.  All new subdivisions shall be connected with an approved water system designed and constructed in accordance with the C & D Manual, as amended, and shall be capable of providing water for health and emergency purposes, including fire protection. All subdivisions must be served by an approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. The City may require the phasing of development and/or improvements in order to maintain adequate wastewater capacity. It shall be the subdivider's responsibility to extend utility lines to provide water or sanitary sewer service, and to procure any necessary off-site easements for required public improvements (e.g., easements for utilities, street stubs/temporary turnarounds, drainage facilities, etc.). 
b.  It shall be the subdivider's responsibility to design all improvements according to the latest edition of the Comprehensive Plan and Water and Wastewater Master Plans, and/or the C & D Manual, whichever are applicable. The City may require that the subdivider oversize the water system and/or the sanitary sewer system where necessary to serve land other than the tract or lots to be platted, including the oversizing of off-site water or sewer mains necessary to extend service to the property to be platted. The cost to be borne by the subdivider and any reimbursement from subsequent users of the facility shall be in accordance with the provisions of the City's policy(s) regarding same (pursuant to Ordinance No. 1479, adopted on August 19, 1985, as may be amended). 
c.  Extension of water and wastewater lines adjacent to any subdivision shall be made along the entire frontage of the subdivision adjacent to a street or thoroughfare. If the subdivision is not adjacent to a thoroughfare, the extension of utilities shall be accomplished in such a manner as to allow future connection to said utilities by new subdivisions. If new subdivisions will never be constructed beyond a developing subdivision due to physical constraints, the Public Works Director may waive the requirement for adjacent utility line construction. 
d.  Installation of utilities not specifically referenced herein shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the City of Waxahachie, Ellis County (when applicable), and the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC). 
Section 3.10: - Stormwater Collection/Conveyance Systems. 
a.  System Design Requirements. Drainage improvements shall accommodate runoff from the entire upstream drainage area, and shall be designed to prevent overloading the capacity of the downstream drainage system. The City may require the phasing of development, the use of control methods such as retention or detention, and/or the construction of off-site drainage improvements in order to mitigate the impact of the proposed development. No stormwater collection system shall be constructed within the City unless it is designed in accordance with the City of Waxahachie's Design Manual for the Design of Storm Drainage Systems by a registered professional engineer and approved by the Public Works Director and City Council. All developed areas shall have concrete curb and gutter drainage systems unless the development has an average lot size of at least twenty thousand (20,000) square feet. These lower density developments can utilize drainage ditch systems or swales according to Subsection (b) [sic] below. All plans submitted to the Public Works Director for approval shall include a layout of the system together with supporting calculations for the design of the system. In addition to any others, the plans shall conform to the City of Waxahachie's Design Manual for the Design of Storm Drainage Systems and the C & D Manual, and shall conform to the following standards and minimums: 
1.  All drainage systems must be designed in accordance with the C & D Manual. The developer shall be required to construct off-site drainage improvements (upstream, downstream, or possibly both) in accordance with the C & D Manual if such improvements are necessary to protect other properties from flooding or other negative impact resulting from construction of the proposed development. 
2.  Run-off conveyed in roadway drainage ditches shall be confined to the ditch. The flow velocity in the ditch shall not exceed six (6) feet per second, and the ditch side slopes shall not exceed three (3) feet horizontal to one foot vertical (3:1). The center of the ditch shall be at least ten (10) feet from the road edge. 
3.  No cross-street (i.e., perpendicular to traffic flow) flow of run-off shall be permitted unless approved by the Public Works Director. When such drainage is allowed, it must be across a concrete street (i.e., valley gutter) and as approved by the Public Works Director. 
4.  For drainage in creeks or streams, or if the natural condition is altered by the developer, for any excavated channels, if the flow is greater than six (6) feet per second or the slope exceeds three (3) to one (3:1), limestone or similar acceptable rock, a reinforced concrete pilot channel or a concrete channel lining shall be required by the City to prevent erosion. Location and type of construction of the open channel must be approved by the Public Works Director. These drainage facilities must be within a common space or within an easement to ensure protection of the area and access for maintenance. 
5.  If the flow is less than six (6) feet per second and if the slope does not exceed three (3) to one (3:1), the creek or excavated channel may be platted as part of the individual lots. The owners of these lots will be responsible for maintenance. Sufficient access shall be provided to provide for protection of these areas and for maintenance purposes. 
6.  For erosion and sedimentation control, the City uses the "Storm Water Quality Best Management Practices for Construction Activities in North Central Texas," a copy of which is filed in the City Manager's (or designee's) office. It is the developer's responsibility to be familiar with, and to comply with, these standards as well as any other policies the City may enact regarding erosion, sedimentation control, non-point source pollution, and other similar issues during construction of the development. 
IV. - PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES 

Section 4.1: - Areas for Public Use. 
a.  The subdivider shall give consideration to suitable and adequate sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, and other areas for public use or service so as to conform with the recommendations contained in the City's Comprehensive Plan, Parks, Recreation & Open Space Master Plan, and other applicable plans. Any provision for schools, parks and/or other public facilities shall be indicated on the preliminary plat and shall be subject to approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. 
b.  No individual, partnership, firm, or corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reroute or change the course or location of any existing ditch, channel, stream, or drainageway, without first obtaining a flood plain permit or written permission of the City or other agency having jurisdiction. 
Section 4.2: - Protection of Drainage and Creek Areas. 
a.  Definitions and Methodology for Determining the Floodway Management Area (FMA). The definitions for "floodway" and "floodway fringe" shall correspond to those set forth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the concept of a floodway is used as a tool to assist the local community in the aspect of flood plain management. Under this concept, the area of the one-hundred-year flood is divided into a floodway and floodway fringe. The floodway is the channel of a stream plus any adjacent flood plain areas that must be kept free of encroachment in order that the one-hundred-year flood may be carried without substantial increases in flood heights as defined by FEMA. The area between the floodway and boundary of the one-hundred-year flood is termed the floodway fringe. 
    For the purposes of this Ordinance, the Floodway Management Area (FMA) will correspond to any and all special flood hazard areas indicated on the most recent FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). 
b.  Areas Where an FMA is Required. All drainage areas or regulated floodways as referenced on the Floodway and Flood Boundary Map (FIRM Maps) that cover the City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be included in the FMA. If FEMA does not specify a floodway zone in any of the creeks or their tributaries, it shall be the developer's responsibility to establish and identify the FMA. The determination shall be made by a registered professional engineer and approved by the Public Works Director. Where improvements to a drainage area are required by other ordinances of the City for the purpose of safety or other reasons related to drainage, those ordinances shall also be observed. The FMA is intended to apply to a creek or channel which is to remain open or in its natural condition. The creek shall remain in its natural state unless improvements are permitted by the City due to the pending development of properties adjacent to or upstream of the required improvements. 
c.  Ownership and Maintenance of the FMA. The area determined to be the FMA shall be designated on and part of the final plat. Approximate locations shall be shown on zoning change requests and preliminary plats. At the City's option, the FMA shall be protected by one of the following methods: 
1.  Dedicated to the City of Waxahachie, at the developer's option; or 
2.  Easement(s). Creeks or drainageways in tracts which have private maintenance provisions, other than single- or two-family platted lots, can be designated as the FMAs by an easement to the City on the final plat. Subdivisions with platted single-family or two-family lots may designate the FMA by easement provided there is adequate maintenance provisions, but no lots or portions of lots may be platted in the easement unless specifically allowed by the City. The area designated as FMA may be identified by a tract number; or 
3.  Certain recreational uses normally associated with or adjacent to flood prone areas (no structures allowed in the FMA), such as golf courses. The uses allowed shall be in conformance with the Zoning Ordinance and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. 
    Prior to acceptance of any drainageway as an FMA by the City, the area shall be cleared of all debris. Floodway management areas dedicated to the City shall be left in a natural state except those areas designated for recreational purposes. 
d.  Design Criteria. The following design criteria shall be required for development adjacent to the FMA: 
1.  Adequate access must be provided along the FMA for public or private maintenance. An unobstructed area a minimum of twenty (20) feet wide with a maximum five (5) to one (5:1) slope (five feet horizontal to one foot vertical), the length of the floodway shall be provided adjacent to or within the FMA. On the opposite side of the drainage area, an unobstructed area having a minimum width of five (5) feet shall be provided. 
2.  Lots in a single-family, PD single-family or duplex residential zoning district shall not be platted within the FMA. If lots back to an FMA, at least two (2) reasonable points of access to the FMA, each a minimum of twenty (20) feet in width, shall be provided. Streets and alleys may qualify as access points if designed such that they are navigable by maintenance vehicles. All areas of the FMA must be accessible from the access points. Lots used for multi-family may be platted in the FMA if the FMA is identified as an easement and is maintained as open space for use by the residents. 
3.  Public streets may be approved in the FMA by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council (if they conform to applicable engineering standards). 
4.  Public streets may be required to be constructed adjacent to some portions of the FMA to allow access for maintenance or recreational opportunities. 
5.  No building sites shall be located within the floodway or flood fringe area. 
6.  Alternate designs to facilitate equal or better access may be permitted if approved by the Public Works Director. 
e.  Drainage areas which have been altered and are not in a natural condition can be exempted from an FMA and this Section at the discretion of the City Council and upon recommendation by the Public Works Director. 
f.  Any construction within the FMA (including, but not limited to, grading, clearing, construction of utility lines, etc.) shall require issuance of a flood plain permit prior to commencement of such construction. 
Section 4.3: - Property/Homeowner's Associations. 
a.  Applicability. When a subdivision contains either common open space or other improvements which are not intended to be dedicated to the City of Waxahachie for public use (e.g., private streets, private recreation facility, landscaped entry features, etc.), a property/homeowners association agreement consistent with State and other appropriate laws, must be submitted to and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, and made a part of the final plat documents. The Conditions, Covenants and Restrictions (i.e., CCRs) and the association documents (i.e., articles of incorporation, by-laws) shall be submitted to the City for review and City approval along with the preliminary plat application, and such documents must contain provisions that satisfy the requirements outlined within this Section. Said documents must, at a minimum, include provisions which allow the City to take over the maintenance of common property (including private streets, private recreation facilities, etc.) using association funds, if such action becomes necessary due to nonperformance or inaction by the association or if the association goes defunct. Provisions shall also be included which would, in the latter instance, convey ownership of the private streets (if any) and all other common areas to the City, and which would allow the City to remove any improvements/amenities from the common areas and sell any buildable land area (as residential lots) to recoup the City's expenses for maintenance and/or demolition of the improvements. Any monies that remain after the City has recovered all of its expenses shall be retained for future maintenance/upgrading of the streets, common areas (if any remain), screening walls, or other improvements within the subdivision. 
b.  Membership. A property/homeowners association shall be an incorporated non-profit organization operating under recorded land agreements through which: 
1.  Each lot owner within the described land area is automatically a member (i.e., membership in the association is mandatory); and 
2.  Each lot is automatically subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the expenses for the property/homeowners association's activities, such as maintenance of common open spaces or the provision and upkeep of common recreational facilities. 
c.  Legal Requirements. In order to assure the establishment of a proper property/homeowners association, including its financing, and the rights and responsibilities of the property/home owners in relation to the use, management and ownership of common property, the subdivision plat, dedication documents, covenants, and other recorded legal agreements must: 
1.  Legally create an automatic membership, non-profit property/homeowners association; 
2.  Place title to the common property in the property/homeowners association, or give definite assurance that it automatically will be so placed within a reasonable, definite time; 
3.  Appropriately limit the uses of the common property; 
4.  Give each lot owner the right to the use and enjoyment of the common property; 
5.  Place responsibility for operation and maintenance of the common property in the property/homeowners association; 
6.  Place an association charge on each lot in a manner which will both assure sufficient association funds and which will provide adequate safeguards for the lot owners against undesirable high charges; 
7.  Give each lot owner voting rights in the association; and 
8.  Must identify land area within the association's jurisdiction including but not limited to the following: 
(a)  Property to be transferred to public agencies; 
(b)  The individual residential lots; 
(c)  The common properties to be transferred by the developer to the property/homeowners association; and 
(d)  Other parcels. 
9.  Any governmental authority or agency, including, but not limited to, the City and the County, their agents, and employees, shall have the right of immediate access to the common elements at all times if necessary for the preservation of public health, safety and welfare. Should the property/homeowners association fail to maintain the common elements to City specifications for an unreasonable time, not to exceed ninety (90) days after written request to do so, then the City shall have the same right, power and authority to enforce the association's rules and to levy assessments necessary to maintain the common elements. The City may elect to exercise the rights and powers of the property/homeowners association or its Board, or to take any action required and levy any assessment that the property/homeowners association might have taken, either in the name of the property/homeowners association or otherwise, to cover the cost of maintenance (or the possible demolition, if such becomes necessary) of any common elements. 
d.  Protective Covenants. Protective covenants shall be developed which, among other things, shall make the property/homeowners association responsible for: 
1.  The maintenance and operation of all common property; 
2.  The enforcement of all other covenants; 
3.  The administration of architectural controls (optional); and 
4.  Certain specified exterior maintenance of exterior improvements of individual properties (optional). 
Section 4.4: - Park Land and Public Facility Dedication. 
a.  Purpose. The City Council of the City of Waxahachie hereby finds as follows: 
1.  Recreational areas, in the form of neighborhood parks, are necessary and in the public welfare, and that the only adequate procedure to provide for same is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property as a residential subdivision in the City of Waxahachie, whether such development consists of new construction on previously vacant land or rebuilding and redeveloping existing residential areas. 
2.  Neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby, the standards for which are set forth in the Waxahachie Parks, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan. 
3.  The cost of neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who, by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities. 
b.  Authority. 
1.  This section is enacted in accordance with the Home Rule powers of the City of Waxahachie, granted under the Texas Constitution and statutes of the State of Texas. 
2.  Any provision for parks and public open space areas shall be indicated on the preliminary and final plat, and shall be subject to approval by the City's Park Board, Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. 
3.  The purpose of this section is to provide for neighborhood parks as a condition of subdivision development in the City of Waxahachie. 
c.  Park Land Dedication. 
1.  Prior to a plat being filed with the County Clerk of Ellis County, Texas for a development of a residential area within the City of Waxahachie, such plat shall contain a clear fee simple dedication at a pro rata rate of two acres of land for each 100 proposed dwelling units. As used in this section, a "dwelling unit" means each individual residence, including individual residences in a multi-family structure, designed and/or intended for inhabitation by a single family. In the event platting is not required, the requirements of this Ordinance must be met at the time of the site plan approved. 
2.  Any proposed plat submitted to the City of Waxahachie for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this section. 
3.  The City Council shall determine the suitability of land proposed to be dedicated as a neighborhood park, upon the recommendation of the Parks Board, and taking into consideration the following factors: 
(A)  Unsuitability of the land for park purposes, including the following: 
(i)  Any area primarily located in the 100-year flood plain. 
(ii)  Any areas of unusual topography or slope which renders same unusable for organized recreational activities. 
(iii)  Drainage areas may be accepted as part of a park if the channel is to remain predominantly in its natural state or constructed in accordance with City engineering standards, if no significant area of the park is cut off from access by such channel, if not less than five (5) acres of the site is above the one-hundred-year flood plain, or if the dedication is in excess of ten (10) acres, not more than fifty (50) percent of the site should be included in the one-hundred-year flood plain. 
(B)  Size of park. For purpose of this section an area of land less than five (5) acres presumptively is impractical for neighborhood park purposes. 
(C)  Access. Each park shall have pedestrian and vehicular access from one or more public streets. Street frontage shall be required to assure public access to park land. 
(D)  Proximity of existing park land. Land dedication may be unsuitable if there are sufficient parks already in the public domain for the area of the proposed development, or if the recreation potential for that area would be better served by expanding or existing neighborhood parks. 
(E)  Drainage. The park land shall have adequate drainage, as determined by the City Public Works Director, who shall review all construction plans for any detention or retention proposed to be built on the land to be dedicated. 
(F)  Trash removal. The subdivider shall remove all trash, effuse and waste materials from the dedicated park land prior to acceptance by the City. 
4.  If the City Council determines that land proposed for neighborhood park dedication is unsuitable in whole or part, it may require payment of park fees in lieu of land dedication, as set forth in subsection d., require a combination of land dedication and payment of fees, or condition plat approval on a different configuration of park land within the proposed development. 
d.  Cash in lieu of land. 
1.  A subdivider responsible for land dedication under this Ordinance shall be required, at the City Council's option, to meet the dedication requirements in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of land. The cash payment in lieu of land dedication shall be met by the payment of a fee set from time to time by ordinance of the City Council sufficient to acquire neighborhood park land. Unless and until changed by the City Council such fee shall be $400.00 per dwelling, and on non-residential property, $600.00 per acre of land in the dedication, with a $600,00 minimum on non-residential property for property under one acre. 
2.  Such payment in lieu of land shall be made prior to final plat approval. 
3.  The City of Waxahachie may from time to time decide to purchase land for parks in or near the area of actual or potential development. If the City does purchase park land in a park service area, subsequent park land dedications for that zone shall be in cash only, the calculation of which is set forth above. Such cash payment is in addition to the payment of the required park development fee. 
e.  Special Fund, Right to Refund. 
1.  All fees in lieu of dedication collected under this section shall be deposited in the City of Waxahachie's Neighborhood Park Land Fund and used solely for the purchase, lease or other acquisition of neighborhood park land, site preparation, and installation of utilities. All expenditures from the said Fund shall be authorized by the City Council. Funds must be spent within one mile of the subdivision from which the fees are collected. In the event the City subsequently designates neighborhood park benefit areas, existing funds may be reasonably allocated among such service areas proportional to the benefits received and thereafter shall be earmarked for expenditure within such benefit areas. 
2.  The City of Waxahachie shall account for all fees paid into the Neighborhood Park Land Fund. Any monies paid into the Fund must be expended by the City of Waxahachie within ten (10) years from the date collected by the City. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis in a particular park service area. If not so expended within the ten-year period, the owners of the property will, on the last day of such period, be entitled to a refund of the remaining fees. The current owners of the property within the subdivision must request such a refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right is waived. 
f.  Exemptions. 
1.  This section shall not apply to a final plat that has been recorded prior to the effective date hereof. 
2.  If a replat is filed that increases the number of dwelling units from the previous plat, the park dedication requirement shall apply to the additional dwelling units.

No subdivision shall be approved unless and until adequate public facilities exist or provision has been made for water facilities, wastewater facilities, drainage facilities, electricity and street facilities which are necessary to serve the development proposed, whether or not such facilities are to be located within the property being platted or off-site. This policy may be defined further and supplemented by other ordinances adopted by the City. Utilities shall be extended to all adjacent property lines to allow connection of these utilities by adjacent property owners when such property is platted. 
c.  The public improvements required by the City of Waxahachie for the acceptance of the subdivision by the City shall include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Water and wastewater facilities; 
2.  Drainage facilities; 
3.  Streets; 
4.  Street lights; 
5.  Street signs; 
6.  Sidewalks; 
7.  Traffic control devices required as part of the project; and 
8.  Appurtenances to the above, and any other public facilities required as part of the proposed subdivision. 
d.  All aspects of the design and implementation of public improvements shall comply with the City's current design standards and any other applicable City codes and ordinances, including preparation and submittal of construction plans and construction inspection. The construction of all of the improvements required in this Ordinance shall conform to the latest edition of the City's C & D Manual. 
e.  Changes or Amendments to the C & D Manual and Other Construction/Design Documents.

The lowest intensity at any point shall not be less than one-tenth (0.1) footcandle per square foot. Street lighting materials shall be approved by the City Manager (or designee). Any costs associated with upgrading street lighting fixtures shall be borne by the developer/property owner. 
Section 5.4: - Street Names and Signs. 
a.  Street names must be submitted to the City for review and approval in accordance with the City's guidelines for the naming of streets. Proposed street names shall be submitted for review along with (and as a part of) the preliminary plat application, and shall become fixed at the time of approval of the preliminary plat. On the final plat, street names shall not be changed from those that were approved on the preliminary plat unless special circumstances have caused the major realignment of streets or a proposed street name(s) is discovered to have already been used elsewhere in the City (or some other similar eventuality). If additional street names are needed for the final plat, then they must be submitted for City staff review and approval along with the final plat application. A fee may be established by the City for the changing of street names after approval of the preliminary plat. 
b.  Surnames of people or the names of corporations or businesses shall not be used as street names, unless approved by the City Council. The City will maintain a list of existing street names (and "reserved" street names that have been approved on a preliminary plat), and will update the list as new streets are platted. 
c.  New street names shall not duplicate existing street names either literally or in a subtle manner (e.g., Smith Street vs. Smythe Street; Oak Drive vs. Oak Place vs. Oak Court vs. Oak Circle), shall not be so similar as to cause confusion between names (e.g., Lakeside Drive vs. Lake Side Drive vs. Lake Siding Drive), and shall not sound like existing street names when spoken (e.g., Oak Drive vs. Doak Drive; Lantern Way vs. Land Tern Way). 
d.  New streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. Streets crossing thoroughfares or other roadways shall bear the same name on both sides of the thoroughfare, wherever practical. 
e.  The property owner shall provide payment for street name signs for the development. The cost of each street name sign installation shall include the cost of the sign assembly, pole and the time for installation. Payment by the property owner will be due prior to approval of the engineering plans by the Public Works Director.

d.  Retaining walls shall not be constructed parallel to and within any portion of a utility easement. 
Section 5.7: - Screening and Landscaping Construction Regulations, Requirements and Design Criteria. 
a.  Screening. 
1.  Where subdivisions are platted so that the rear or side yards of single-family or two-family residential lots are adjacent to an arterial thoroughfare (greater than sixty (60) feet in right-of-way width on the Thoroughfare Plan); a four-lane collector street; are separated from a thoroughfare by an alley; or back up to a collector or residential street, the developer shall provide, at his sole expense, screening according to the following alternatives and standards. All screening shall be adjacent to the right-of-way or property line. All forms of screening shall conform to the requirements of other ordinances in the City governing sight distance for traffic safety. 
A minimum fifteen (15) foot landscape buffer shall be provided exclusive of all required street and turn lane right-of-way adjacent to the Type A or Type B thoroughfare. A minimum ten (10) foot landscape buffer shall be provide exclusive of all required street and turn lane right-of-way adjacent to a Type C or Type D thoroughfare. 
Trees shall be planted within the landscape buffer. The total number of caliper inches of the trees shall be equal to or exceed one (1) caliper inch per ten (10) linear feet of frontage of the landscape buffer. Minimum tree size shall be three (3) caliper inches. A single species of tree shall not exceed forty (40) percent of the plantings. These will be required to be irrigated. Any screening items will be maintained by the Home Owners Association. 
2.  Screening Alternatives. Screening shall be provided in accordance with, and shall be constructed to, standards and criteria as set forth in the City's C & D Manual and/or other related City code(s)/policy(s). 
3.  A maintenance easement five feet (5') in width shall be dedicated to the City on the private lot side and adjacent to the screening wall. 
4.  The screening wall shall be installed prior to the final acceptance of the subdivision. Landscape materials may be installed after the subdivision is accepted, upon approval of the City Manager (or designee), but in no case later than six (6) months following acceptance of the subdivision. 
5.  All plants (e.g., trees, shrubs, ground cover) shall be living and in sound, healthy, vigorous and growing condition, and they shall be of a size, fullness and height that is customary for their container/ball size (as per the latest edition of the "American Standard for Nursery Stock", by the American Association of Nurserymen, as may be amended). 
6.  All masonry, steel and/or aluminum screening wall/fence plans and details must be designed and sealed by a registered engineer or other qualified professional, and must be approved by the Public Works Director. 
7.  Required wall heights, including spans between columns, shall be from at least six (6) feet and no more than eight (8) feet. Decorative columns, pilasters, stone caps, and other features may exceed the maximum eight-foot height by up to eighteen (18) inches (i.e., total maximum height of nine and one-half (91/2) feet, provided that such taller elements comprise no more than ten (10) percent of the total wall length (in elevation view). 
8.  Screening fences/walls shall not be constructed parallel to and within any portion of a utility easement unless provisions are made for access and maintenance. 
b.  Entryway Features (neighborhood identification). 
1.  Subdivisions in excess of ten (10) platted lots may provide a low maintenance landscaped entryway feature at access points from streets and thoroughfares into the subdivision. The entryway feature shall be placed within an easement identified for such use adjacent to or within the right-of-way, and shall observe all sight visibility requirements. 
2.  Design Requirements. The entryway feature shall include living landscaped materials as specified in Appendix "A-4" of the City's Zoning Ordinance. The design of the entryway feature shall also include an automatic underground irrigation system, and may also include subdivision identification (i.e., signage located on the wall). All plants shall be living and in a sound, healthy, vigorous and growing condition, and they shall be of a size, fullness and height that are customary for their container/ball size (as per the latest edition of the "American Standard for Nursery Stock", by the American Association of Nurserymen, as may be amended). 
3.  The design of the entryway shall be in accordance with design policies as provided by City staff. The design of the entry shall be reflected on the engineering plans submitted with the preliminary plat, and shall be approved by the City in conjunction with approval of the construction plans. 
4.  The maintenance of the entryway shall be the responsibility of the developer for a period of at least two (2) years or until building permits have been issued for eighty (80) percent of the lots in the subdivision, whichever date is later. Following that period of time, maintenance responsibility shall be borne by the private property owner(s) upon whose lot(s) the entryway feature is located, or by an approved homeowners association (see Section 4.3). If, at some point in time, the maintenance responsibility shifts to the City, the City shall have the right to upgrade, reduce or eliminate entirely, at its sole option, the landscaping and other amenities in order to simplify and/or minimize the amount of time and effort that maintenance of the entryway will require.

Section 5.8: - Water and Sewer Requirements 
a.  The installation of all water and wastewater lines shall be in conformance with the C & D Manual. 
b.  No final plat shall be approved for any subdivision within the City or its extraterritorial jurisdiction until the subdivider has made adequate provision for a water system and a sanitary sewer system of sufficient capacity to adequately provide service to all tracts and lots within the area to be subdivided. The design and construction of the water system and of the sanitary sewer system to serve the subdivision shall be in conformance with the City's master plans for water and wastewater facilities, and shall be approved by the Public Works Director. 
c.  Water system with mains of sufficient size and having a sufficient number of outlets to furnish adequate domestic water supply and to furnish fire protection to all lots shall be provided. Water lines shall extend to the property line, and a box for the water meter(s) for each lot shall be installed either in the right-of-way or immediately adjacent to the right-of-way in an easement. 
d.  Services for utilities shall be made available to the property line of each lot in such a manner as will minimize the necessity for disturbing the street pavement and drainage structure when connections are made. 
e.  Fire hydrants shall be installed in residential areas every five hundred (500) feet of laying distance, and in nonresidential areas every three hundred (300) feet of laying distance. The Fire Chief shall have the authority to approve the locations and placement of all fire hydrants (and fire lanes), and may, at his discretion, modify fire hydrant spacing based upon special design/distance circumstances. 
Section 5.9: - Improvement of Adjacent Existing Streets and Utilities. 
a.  When a proposed subdivision of land, whether residential or nonresidential, abuts on both sides of an existing substandard street, or on one side of said road, being substandard according to the then existing current Thoroughfare Plan, the developer may be required to improve the existing on-site facility as that term is defined herein, including on-site sidewalks, landscaping, storm sewers and other utilities as defined in Section 1.17, to bring the same to City standards, or to replace it with a standard City street as determined by the traffic impact analysis, if required (see Section 3.1) at no cost to the City. 
b.  The subdivider shall be responsible for construction of a minimum of one-half (1/2) or all, as the case may be, according to Subsections [a] through [d]) of the width of a residential street adjacent to the site. For the purposes of this Ordinance, residential properties shall be responsible for twenty-six (26) feet, or fifteen and one-half (151/2) feet if adjacent to only one side, of paving. All other uses shall be responsible for thirty-seven (37) feet of paving, or eighteen and one-half (181/2) feet if adjacent to only one side. In lieu of construction, a proportionate fee for curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm drainage, street lights, and street signs may be assessed against any perimeter road. The perimeter and off-site streets required for improvement shall be determined by the traffic impact analysis outlined in Section 3.1. 
c.  Streets which dead-end at power lines or similar rights-of-way or easements, and which are intended for future extension across these rights-of-way or easements, shall be constructed in the right-of-way or easement for half the distance across the right-of-way or easement, and shall be further restricted as set forth in Section 3.1. As with any other dead-end street, a note shall be placed on the final plat clearly labeling the dead-end streets that will, at some point, be extended across the power line easement (or right-of-way), and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street curb (on the barricade) also stating that the street will be extended in the future. 
Section 5.10: - Storm Drainage. 
a.  An adequate storm sewer system consisting of inlets, pipes and other underground structures with approved outlets shall be constructed where runoff of storm water and the prevention of erosion cannot be accomplished satisfactorily by surface drainage facilities. Areas subject to flood conditions and/or inadvertent storm water retention (i.e., standing or pooling water), as established by the City, will not be considered for development until adequate drainage has been provided. 
b.  The criteria for use in designing storm sewers, culverts, bridges, drainage channels, and drainage facilities shall conform to the City of Waxahachie's drainage criteria in the C & D Manual. In no case shall drainage areas be diverted artificially to adjacent properties or across roadways. 
c.  The developer shall ensure that all drainage improvements within public easements or rights-of-way are functioning properly prior to the expiration of the maintenance bond. The developer shall be responsible for removing any significant build-up of sediment and/or trash from drainage improvements, with the exception of backlot and sidelot drainage swales, at the eleventh month of the second year for the required two-year maintenance bond for the applicable facilities. The City shall inspect the improvements to determine any maintenance or correction of deficiencies at the conclusion of this period. 
Section 5.11: - Mail/Delivery Boxes. 
    All subdivisions shall provide adequate areas and access for mail boxes. All mail boxes and similar areas and/or facilities for mail/package delivery shall be installed in accordance with U.S. Postal Service guidelines, and shall be accessible in accordance with ADA regulations. 
VI. - REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCEPTANCE OF SUBDIVISIONS BY THE CITY OF WAXAHACHIE 

Section 6.1: - Withholding City Services and Improvements Until Acceptance. 
a.  The City hereby defines its policy to be that the City will withhold all City services and improvements of whatsoever nature, including the maintenance of streets, the furnishing of sewage facilities, water service, other utility service, and all other City services from all additions until all of the street, utility, storm drainage and other public improvements, as well as lot improvements (e.g., grading and installation of improvements required for proper lot drainage and prevention of soil erosion, retaining walls, etc.) on the individual residential lots, are properly constructed according to the approved engineering plans and to City standards, and until such public improvements are dedicated to and accepted by the City. 
Section 6.2: - Guarantee of Public Improvements. 
a.  Subdivider's Guarantee. Before approving the final plat of a subdivision located all or partially within the City and/or the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction, the City Council must be satisfied that all public improvements required shall have been constructed in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
b.  Improvement Agreement and Guarantee. Based upon a recommendation by the City Manager (or designee), the City Council may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approval of the final plat, and may permit the property owner to enter into an improvement agreement by which the property owner covenants to complete all required public improvements no later than two (2) years following the date upon which the final plat is approved. The City Council may also require the property owner to complete and dedicate some of the required public improvements prior to approval of the final plat, and to enter into an improvement agreement for completion of the remainder of the required improvements during such two-year period. The improvement agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions as are agreed to by the property owner and the City. Nothing within this section shall nullify the City's obligation to participate in the construction of oversize facilities (pursuant to Ordinance No. 1479, adopted on August 19, 1985, as may be amended). 
c.  Improvement Agreement Required for Oversize Reimbursement. The City shall require an improvement agreement pertaining to any public improvement for which the developer shall request reimbursement from the City for oversize costs. The City Council shall authorize the approval of such agreement as meeting the requirements of the City. The Public Works Director is authorized to sign an improvement agreement on behalf of the City. 
d.  Security. Whenever the City permits a property owner to enter into an improvement agreement, it shall require the owner to provide sufficient security, covering the completion of the public improvements. The security shall be in the form of cash escrow or, where authorized by the City, a letter of credit or other security acceptable to the City Attorney, as security for the promises contained in the improvement agreement. In addition to all other security, for completion of those public improvements where the City participates in the cost, the owner shall provide a performance bond from the contractor, with the City as a co-obligee. Security shall be in an amount equal to one hundred (100) percent of the estimated cost of completion (including engineering design fees, contingencies, administrative costs, and other related costs) of the required public improvements and lot improvements. The issuer of any surety bond and letter of credit shall be subject to the approval of the City Attorney. 
e.  Letter of Credit. If the City Manager authorizes the property owner to post a letter of credit as security for its promises contained in the improvement agreement, the letter of credit shall: 
1.  Be irrevocable; 
2.  Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods, but in no event less than two (2) years; and 
3.  Require only that the City present the issuer with a sight draft and a certificate signed by an authorized representative of the City certifying to the City's right to draw funds under the letter of credit. 
f.  As portions of the public improvements are completed in accordance with the C & D Manual and the approved engineering plans, the developer may make application to the Public Works Director (or designee) to reduce the amount of the original letter of credit. If the Public Works Director (or designee) is satisfied that such portion of the improvements has been completed in accordance with City standards, he may (but is not required to) cause the amount of the letter of credit to be reduced by such amount that he deems appropriate, so that the remaining amount of the letter of credit adequately insures the completion of the remaining public improvements. 
g.  Upon the dedication of and acceptance by the City of all required public improvements, the City shall authorize a reduction in the security to ten (10) percent of the original amount of the security if the property owner is not in breach of the improvement agreement. The remaining security shall be security for the owner's covenant to maintain the required public improvements and to warrant that the improvements are free from defects for two (2) years thereafter. If the required security for maintenance and warranty is otherwise provided by the contractors or by others, the City will release the entire amount of the developer's security. 
Section 6.3: - Temporary Improvements. 
    The property owner shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the City, and shall maintain those temporary improvements for the period specified by the City. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the owner shall file with the City a separate improvement agreement and escrow or, where authorized, a letter of credit, in an appropriate amount for temporary facilities, which agreement and escrow or letter of credit shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed. 
Section 6.4: - Government Units. 
    Governmental units to which these contract and security provisions apply may file, in lieu of the contract and security, a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agents authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this Section. 
Section 6.5: - Failure to Complete Improvements. 
a.  For plats for which no improvement agreement has been executed and no security has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed within the period specified by the City, the land study or preliminary plat approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where an improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted, and the required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of the agreement, the City may: 
1.  Declare the agreement to be in default and require that all the public improvements be installed regardless of the extent of completion of the development at the time the agreement is declared to be in default; 
2.  The final plat shall not be accepted for approval until the public improvements are completed; 
3.  Obtain funds under the security and complete the public improvements itself or through a third party; 
4.  Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third party, including a subsequent owner of the subdivision for which public improvements were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that subsequent owner's promise to complete the public improvements on the property; 
5.  Exercise any other rights available under the law. 
Section 6.6: - Acceptance of Dedication Offers. 
    Acceptance of formal offers for the dedication of streets, public areas, easements and/or parks shall be by authorization of the City Manager (or designee). The approval by the City of a preliminary or final plat shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the City of any street, public area, easement or park shown on the plat. The City may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. 
Section 6.7: - Maintenance and Guarantee of Public Improvements. 
    The owner shall maintain all required public improvements for a period of two (2) years following acceptance of the subdivision by the City, and shall also provide a warranty that all public improvements will be free from defects for a period of two (2) years following such acceptance by the City. 
Section 6.8: - Construction Procedures. 
a.  A permit is required from the Public Works Director prior to beginning any work in the City or its extraterritorial jurisdiction which affects erosion control, public utilities, storm drainage, vegetation or tree removal, or a flood plain. 
b.  Preconstruction Conference. The Public Works Director may require that all contractors participating in the construction meet for a preconstruction conference to discuss the project prior to release of a grading permit and before any filling, excavation, clearing and/or removal of vegetation and trees that are larger than eight-inch caliper. 
c.  Conditions Prior to Authorization. Prior to authorizing release of a grading permit, the Public Works Director shall be satisfied that the following conditions have been met: 
1.  The preliminary plat shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and by City Council; 
2.  All required contract documents are completed and filed with the Public Works Director; 
3.  All necessary off-site easements and/or dedications required for City-maintained facilities and not shown on the final plat must be conveyed solely to the City (i.e., by separate instrument), with the proper signatures affixed. The original of the documents and the appropriate filing fees (per the City's submission guidelines, as may be amended from time to time) shall be returned to the Public Works Director prior to approval and release of the engineering plans; 
4.  All contractors participating in the construction shall be presented with a set of approved plans bearing the stamp of release of the Public Works Director (at least one set of these plans shall remain on the job site at all times); 
5.  A complete list of the contractors, their representatives on the site, and telephone numbers where a responsible party may be reached at all times must be submitted to the Public Works Director; and 
6.  All applicable fees must be paid to the City. 
Section 6.9: - Inspection of Public Improvements. 
a.  General Procedure. Construction inspection shall be supervised by the Public Works Director. Construction shall be in accordance with the approved engineering plans and the C & D Manual of the City of Waxahachie (and other applicable codes and ordinances). Any change in design that is required during construction should be made by the registered professional engineer whose seal and signature are shown on the plans. Another engineer may make revisions to the original engineering plans if so authorized by the owner of the plans, and if those revisions are noted on the plans or documents. All revisions shall be approved by the Public Works Director. If the Public Works Director finds, upon inspection, that any of the required public improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the City's standards and C & D Manual, then the property owner shall be responsible for completing and/or correcting the deficiencies such that they are brought into conformance with the applicable standards. 
b.  Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The City will not accept dedication of required public improvements until the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the Public Works Director, through submission of detailed "as-built", or record, drawings of the property which indicate all public improvements and their locations, dimensions, materials and other information required by the Public Works Director, and until all required public improvements have been completed. The "as-builts" shall also include a complete set of record drawings of the paving, drainage, water, sanitary sewer and/or other public improvements, showing that the layout of the lines and grades of all public improvements are in accordance with construction plans for the plat, and showing all changes made in the plans during construction, and containing on each sheet an "as-built" stamp bearing the signature of the registered professional engineer and the date. One reproducible drawing of the utility plan sheets containing the as-built information shall also be submitted. The engineer or surveyor shall also furnish the City with a copy of the final plat and the engineering plans, if prepared on a CADD system, in such a digital format (i.e., on disk) that is compatible with the City's CADD system. When such requirements have been met, the Public Works Director shall issue a letter of acceptance to the developer. 
Acceptance of the development shall mean that the developer has transferred all rights to all the public improvements to the City for use and maintenance. The City Council may, at its option, accept dedication of a portion of the required public improvements if the remaining public improvements are not immediately required for health and safety reasons, and if the owner has posted a performance bond, letter of credit or cash bond in the amount of one hundred (100) percent of the estimated cost of those remaining improvements for a length of time to be determined by the City Council. If the remaining public improvements are greater than $10,000.00 and are not completed within the determined length of time, the City will impose a ten (10) percent penalty of the performance bond, letter of credit, or cash bond. The obligation to complete the improvements remains with the developer, and all future building permits or certificates of occupancy will be withheld until the improvements are complete. If the remaining public improvements are less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), the developer shall pay the actual dollar amount. The length of time may be extended due to inclement weather or unforeseen delays by mutual agreement between the developer and the City. 
Upon acceptance of the required public improvements, the Public Works Director shall submit a certificate to the developer stating that all required public improvements have been satisfactorily completed. 
Section 6.10: - Deferral of Required Improvements. 
a.  The City Council may, upon petition of the property owner and favorable recommendation of the Public Works Director, defer at the time of final plat approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all public improvements as, in its judgment, are not required in the interests of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
b.  Whenever a petition to defer the construction of any public improvements required under this Ordinance is granted by the City Council, the property owner shall deposit in escrow his share of the costs (in accordance with City participation and oversizing policies) of the future public improvements with the City prior to approval of the final plat, or the property owner may execute a separate improvement agreement secured by a cash escrow or, where authorized, a letter of credit guaranteeing completion of the deferred public improvements upon demand of the City. 
Section 6.11: - Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy. 
a.  No building permit shall be issued for a lot or building site unless the lot or site has been officially recorded by a final plat approved by the City of Waxahachie, and unless all public improvements, as required by this Ordinance for final plat approval, have been completed, except as permitted below: 
1.  Building permits may be issued for a non-residential or multi-family (i.e., apartments) development provided that a preliminary plat has been approved by the City, and construction plans have been released by the Public Works Director. However, building construction will not be allowed to surpass the construction of fire protection improvements (i.e., the building shall not proceed above the slab level until all required fire lanes have been completed, and until all water lines serving fire hydrants have been completed, and inspected/tested). 
2.  The Building Official may release some residential building permits for a portion of a subdivision (i.e., for not more than ten (10) percent of the new residential lots), provided that a preliminary plat has been approved by the City, and all public improvements have been completed for that portion of the development including, but not limited to, those required for fire and emergency protection (i.e., streets including at least two (2) points of access, alleys, water lines serving fire hydrants, emergency access points, etc.). Notwithstanding, no lot may be sold nor title conveyed until the final plat has been approved by the City and has been recorded at the County. 
3.  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building or the use of property unless all subdivision improvements have been completed and a final plat has been approved by the City and recorded at the County. Notwithstanding the above, the Chief Building Official and the Public Works Director may jointly authorize the conditional occupancy of a structure provided that an agreement providing cash escrow, a letter of credit, or other sufficient surety is approved by the City for the completion of all remaining public improvements, and provided that the structure is safely habitable in accordance with the City's Building Codes.
