PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Hopewell, Virginia, of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1963 Hopewell City Code as supplemented through July 8, 1975, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1963 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. Appendix C of the Code lists the ordinances adopted since July 8, 1975, which have not been codified. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of the volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the ninth section of Chapter 2 is 2-9. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-2 and 4-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-2.1, 4-2.2 and 4-2.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Robert D. Ussery, Vice President, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publishers' staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Carl R. Pigeon, City Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active laws of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

(a)  As used in this section, dangerous dog means a canine or canine crossbreed that has bitten, attacked, or inflicted injury on a person or companion animal that is a dog or cat, or killed a companion animal that is a dog or cat; however, when a dog attacks or bites a companion animal that is a dog or cat, the attacking or biting dog shall not be deemed dangerous if (i) no serious physical injury as determined by a licensed veterinarian has occurred to the dog or cat as a result of the attack or bite, (ii) if both animals are owned by the same person, (iii) if such attack occurs on the property of the attacking or biting dog's owner or custodian, or (iv) for other good cause as determined by the court. No dog shall be found to be a dangerous dog as a result of biting, attacking or inflicting injury on a dog or cat while engaged with an owner or custodian as part of lawful hunting or participating in an organized, lawful dog handling event. No dog that has bitten attacked, or inflicted injury on a person shall be found to be a dangerous dog if the court determines, based on the totality of the evidence before it, that the dog is not dangerous or a threat to the community. 
    Vicious dog means a canine or canine crossbreed that has (i) killed a person; (ii) inflicted serious injury to a person, including multiple bites, serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health, or serious impairment of a bodily function; or (iii) continued to exhibit the behavior that resulted in a previous finding by a court or, on or before July 1, 2006, by an animal control officer that it is a dangerous dog, provided that its owner has been given notice of that finding. 
(b)  Any law enforcement officer or animal control officer who has reason to believe that a canine or canine crossbreed within the city is a dangerous dog or vicious dog shall apply to a magistrate of the city for the issuance of a summons requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear before the general district court at a specified time. The summons shall advise the owner of the nature of the proceeding and the matters at issue. If a law enforcement officer successfully makes an application for the issuance of a summons, he shall contact the city animal control officer and inform him of the location of the dog and the relevant facts pertaining to his belief that the dog is dangerous or vicious. The animal control officer shall confine the animal until such time as evidence shall be heard and a verdict rendered. If the animal control officer determines that the owner or custodian can confine the animal in a manner that protects the public safety, he may permit the owner or custodian to confine the animal until such time as evidence shall be heard and a verdict rendered. The court, through its contempt powers, may compel the owner, custodian or harborer of the animal to produce the animal. If, after hearing the evidence, the court finds that the animal is a dangerous dog, the court shall order the animal's owner to comply with the provisions of this section. If, after hearing the evidence, the court finds that the animal is a vicious dog, the court shall order the animal euthanized in accordance with the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 3.2-6562. The procedure for appeal and trial shall be the same as provided by law for misdemeanors. Trial by jury shall be as provided in Code of Virginia, Article 4 (§ 19.2-260 et seq.) of Chapter 15 of Title 19.2. The Commonwealth shall be required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. 
(c)  No canine or canine crossbreed shall be found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog solely because it is a particular breed, nor is the ownership of a particular breed of canine or canine crossbreed prohibited. No animal shall be found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog if the threat, injury or damage was sustained by a person who was (i) committing, at the time, a crime upon the premises occupied by the animal's owner or custodian, (ii) committing, at the time, a willful trespass upon the premises occupied by the animal's owner or custodian or (iii) provoking, tormenting, or physically abusing the animal, or can be shown to have repeatedly provoked, tormented, abused, or assaulted the animal at other times. No police dog that was engaged in the performance of its duties as such at the time of the acts complained of shall be found to be a dangerous dog or a vicious dog. No animal which, at the time of the acts complained of, was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its kennel, its offspring, a person, or its owner's or custodian's property, shall be found to be a dangerous dog or a vicious dog. 
(d)  If the owner of an animal found to be a dangerous dog is a minor, the custodial parent or legal guardian shall be responsible for complying with all requirements of this section. 
(e)  The owner of any animal found to be a dangerous dog shall, within ten (10) days of such finding, obtain a dangerous dog registration certificate from the treasurer for a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) in addition to other fees that may be authorized by law. The treasurer shall also provide the owner with a uniformly designed tag that identifies the animal as a dangerous dog. The owner shall affix the tag to the animal's collar and ensure that the animal wears the collar and tag at all times. All certificates obtained pursuant to this subsection shall be renewed annually for the same fee and in the same manner as the initial certificate was obtained. The animal control officer shall provide a copy of the dangerous dog registration certificate and verification of compliance to the state veterinarian. 
(f)  All dangerous dog registration certificates or renewal thereof required to be obtained under this section shall only be issued to persons eighteen (18) years of age or older who present satisfactory evidence (i) of the animal's current rabies vaccination; (ii) that the animal is and will be confined in a proper enclosure or is and will be confined inside the owner's residence or is and will be muzzled and confined in the owner's fenced-in yard until the proper enclosure is constructed; (iii) that the animal has been neutered or spayed; and (iv) that the owner has liability insurance coverage, to the value of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) per incident, that covers animal bites, or a bond in surety, in lieu of liability insurance, to the value of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). In addition, owners who apply for certificates or renewals thereof under this section shall not be issued a certificate or renewal thereof unless they present satisfactory evidence that (i) the residence housing the dog is and will continue to be posted with clearly visible signs warning both minors and adults of the presence of a dangerous dog on the property and (ii) the animal has been permanently identified by means of a tattoo on the inside thigh or by electronic implantation. 
(g)  While on the property of its owner, an animal found to be a dangerous dog shall be confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked structure of sufficient height and design to prevent its escape and to prevent direct contact with or entry by minors, adults, or other animals. The structure shall be designed to provide the animal with shelter from the elements of nature. When off its owner's property, an animal found to be a dangerous dog shall be kept on a leash and muzzled in such a manner as not to cause injury to the animal or interfere with the animal's vision or respiration, but so as to prevent it from biting a person or another animal. 
(h)  The owner of any dog found to be dangerous shall register the animal with the Commonwealth of Virginia Dangerous Dog Registry, as established under Code of Virginia, § 3.2-6542, within forty-five (45) days of such a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction. The owner shall also cause the city animal control officer to be promptly notified of (i) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all owners; (ii) all of the means necessary to locate the owner and the dog at any time; (iii) any complaints or incidents of attack by the dog upon any person or cat or dog; (iv) any claims made or lawsuits brought as a result of any attack; (v) tattoo or chip identification information or both; (vi) proof of insurance or surety bond; and (vii) the death of the dog. 
(i)  After an animal has been found to be a dangerous dog, the animal's owner shall immediately, upon learning of same, cause the local animal control authority to be notified if the animal (i) is loose or unconfined; or (ii) bites a person or attacks another animal; or (iii) is sold, given away, or dies. Any owner of a dangerous dog who relocates to a new address shall, within ten (10) days of relocating, provide written notice to the appropriate local animal control authority for the old address from which the animal has moved and the new address to which the animal has been moved. 
(j)  Any owner or custodian of a canine or canine crossbreed or other animal is guilty of a: 
(1)  Class 2 misdemeanor if the canine or canine crossbreed previously declared a dangerous dog pursuant to this section, when such declaration arose out of a separate and distinct incident, attacks and injures or kills a cat or dog that is a companion animal belonging to another person. 
(2)  Class 1 misdemeanor if the canine or canine crossbreed previously declared a dangerous dog pursuant to this section, when such declaration arose out of a separate and distinct incident, bites a human being or attacks a human being causing bodily injury. 
(3)  Class 6 felony if any owner or custodian whose willful act or omission in the care, control, or containment of a canine, canine crossbreed, or other animal is so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life, and is the proximate cause of such dog or other animal attacking and causing serious bodily injury to any person. 
The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any animal that, at the time of the acts complained of, was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its kennel, its offspring, a person, or its owner's or custodian's property, or when the animal is a police dog that is engaged in the performance of its duties at the time of the attack. 
(k)  The owner of any animal that has been found to be a dangerous dog who willfully fails to comply with the requirements of this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. 
(l)  All fees collected pursuant to this section, less the costs incurred by the animal control authority in producing and distributing the certificates and tags required by this section, shall be paid into a special dedicated fund in the treasury of the city for the purpose of paying the expenses of any training course required under Code of Virginia, § 3.2-6556.

(d)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the waiver or rescission of the service fee or assessment in appeals that meet any or all of the above factors.

The city manager may cause the approved plan to be implemented to repair or acquire and dispose of the property in accordance with the approved plan, the provisions of this section, and the applicable law. If the ordinance is adopted by the council of the City of Hopewell, the city shall have a lien on all property so repaired or acquired under an approved spot blight abatement plan to recover the cost of (i) improvements made by the city to bring the blighted property into compliance with applicable building codes and (ii) disposal, if any, as provided by Code of Virginia, § 36-49.1:1(E) (Spot blight abatement authorized; procedure), of title 36 (Housing), as amended.

A separate license shall be required for each definite place of business and for each business. A person engaged in two (2) or more businesses or professions carried on at the same place of business may elect to obtain one (1) license for all such businesses and professions if all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) each business or profession is subject to licensure at the location and has satisfied any requirements imposed by state law or other provisions of the ordinances of this city; (ii) all of the businesses or professions are subject to the same tax rate, or, if subject to different tax rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed on all businesses and professions at the highest rate; and (iii) the taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the assessor may require concerning the nature of the several businesses and their gross receipts.

(Ord. No. 87-17, 6-23-87; Ord. No. 94-36, 11-2-94; Ord. No. 96-33, § D, 11-12-96) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 96-33, by title repealed § 20-6(a)-(c). Sec. D of such ordinance was designated by the editor as § 20-6(a). See also the editor's note following § 20-7. 
Sec. 20-7. - Due dates; late payment penalties and interest. 
(a)  Each person subject to a license tax under this chapter shall apply for a license prior to beginning business if he was not subject to licensure in this city on or before January 1 of the license year, or no later than March 1 of the current license year if he had been issued a license for the preceding license year. The application shall be on forms prescribed by the assessing official. 
(b)  The tax shall be paid with the application in the case of any license not based on gross receipts. If the tax is measured by the gross receipts of the business, the tax shall be paid on or before March 31. Semiannual payments for license taxes shall be authorized pursuant to section 20-19. 
(c)  The assessing official may grant an extension of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, in which to file an application for a license, for reasonable cause. The extension may be conditioned upon the timely payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax, subject to adjustment to the correct tax at the end of the extension together with interest from the due date until the date paid and, if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under the circumstances, a penalty of ten (10) percent of the portion paid after the due date. 
(d)  A penalty of ten (10) percent of the tax may be imposed upon the failure to file an application or the failure to pay the tax by the appropriate due date. Only the late filing penalty shall be imposed by the assessing official if both the application and payment are late; however, both penalties may be assessed if the assessing official determines that the taxpayer has a history of noncompliance. In the case of an assessment of additional tax made by the assessing official, if the application and, if applicable, the return were made in good faith and the understatement of the tax was not due to any fraud or reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the additional tax. If any assessment of tax by the assessing official is not paid within thirty (30) days, the treasurer may impose a ten (10) percent late payment penalty. The penalties shall not be imposed, or if imposed, shall be abated by the official who assessed them, if the failure to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer. In order to demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he acted responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his control. 
    "Acted responsibly" means that: (i) the taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the business, and (ii) the taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the failure, such as requesting appropriate extensions (where applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment, acting to remove an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a failure once the impediment was removed or the failure discovered. 
    "Events beyond the taxpayer's control" include, but are not limited to, the unavailability of records due to fire or other casualty; the unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the taxpayer's reasonable reliance in good faith upon erroneous written information from the assessing official, who was aware of the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when he provided the erroneous information. 
(e)  Any person failing to make the application required by this section shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. 
(f)  It shall be the duty of the commissioner of the revenue to keep a record of all applications filed under this section. 
(g)  Interest shall be charged on the late payment of the tax from the due date until the date paid without regard to fault or other reason for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or omitted tax by the assessing official is found to be erroneous, all interest and penalty charged and collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous shall be refunded together with interest on the refund from the date of payment or the due date, whichever is later. Interest shall be paid on the refund of any tax paid under this chapter from the date of payment or due date, whichever is later, whether attributable to an amended return or other reason. Interest on any refund shall be paid at the same rate charged under Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3916. 
    No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability to actual liability at the conclusion of a base year. No interest shall be paid on a refund or charged on a late payment in event of such adjustment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not more than thirty (30) days from (i) the date of the payment that created the refund, or (ii) the due date of the tax, whichever is later. 
(Ord. No. 96-33, § E, 11-12-96) 
Editor's note- At the request of the city, provisions formerly designated as § 20-6(d) and (e) were redesignated as § 20-7(e) and (f), and § 20-7(e) was redesignated as (g). See also the editor's note following § 20-10. 
Sec. 20-8. - Situs of gross receipts. 
(a)  General rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this chapter is measured by gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a privilege subject to licensure at a definite place of business within this city. In the case of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities are initiated, directed, or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for different classifications of business shall be attributed to one (1) or more definite places of business or offices as follows: 
(1)  The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which his services are performed, or if his services are not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715. 
(2)  The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation activities are directed or controlled; however, a wholesaler or distribution house subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two or more localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different measures, may apply to the department of taxation for a determination as to the proper measure of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality. 
(3)  The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented from any definite place of business, then the definite place of business at which the rental of such property is managed. 
(4)  The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are performed or, if not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled. 
(b)  Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one definite place of business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed under the general rule and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an apportionment agreement, except as to circumstances set forth in § 58.1-3709 of the Code of Virginia, the gross receipts of the business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless some activities under the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from, such definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction shall not be attributed to this city solely because the other jurisdiction does not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction. 
(c)  Agreements. The assessor may enter into agreements with any other political subdivision of Virginia concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business. However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one (1) or more political subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has resulted in, or is likely to result in, taxes on more than one hundred (100) percent of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the assessor shall make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions involved. 
(Ord. No. 96-33, § F, 11-12-96) 
Note- See the editor's note following § 20-10. 
Sec. 20-9. - Limitations and extensions. 
(a)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed pursuant to this chapter, both the assessing official and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
(b)  Notwithstanding Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3903, the assessing official shall assess the local license tax omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a license for the current license year and the six (6) preceding license years. 
(c)  The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior to the period specified in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3940, two (2) years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to this subdivision of this chapter, two (2) years after the final determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed pursuant to section 20-10(b) or (d) of this chapter, or two (2) years after the final decision in a court application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984 or similar law for which collection has been stayed, whichever is later. 
(Ord. No. 96-33, § G, 11-12-96) 
Sec. 20-10. - Appeals and rulings. 
(a)  Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of an audit may apply within ninety (90) days from the date of such assessment to the assessor for a correction of the assessment. The application must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, audit period, remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The assessor may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and documents, a further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of the application. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. The assessor shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a determination to the taxpayer setting forth its position. Every assessment pursuant to an audit shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to seek correction and the specific procedure to be followed in this city (e.g., the name and address to which an application should be directed). 
(b)  Provided a timely and complete application is made, collection activity shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the assessor, unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 20-7(g) of this chapter, but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" includes a finding that the application is frivolous, or that a taxpayer desires to (i) depart quickly from the locality, (ii) remove his property therefrom, (iii) conceal himself or his property therein, or (iv) do any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to collect the tax for the period in question. 
(c)  Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of an audit may apply within ninety (90) days of the determination by the assessing official on an application pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for a correction of such assessment. The tax commissioner shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within ninety (90) days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and the assessing official are notified that a longer period will be required. The application shall be treated as an application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1821, and the tax commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1822. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the assessing official may apply to the appropriate circuit court pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984. However, the burden shall be on the party making the application to show that the ruling of the tax commissioner is erroneous. Neither the tax commissioner nor the department of taxation shall be made a party to an application to correct an assessment merely because the tax commissioner has ruled on it. 
(d)  On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the tax commissioner under subsection (c) of this section, the assessing official shall further suspend collection activity until a final determination is issued by the tax commissioner, unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g) of section 20-7, but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(e)  Any taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the application of the tax to a specific situation from the assessor. Any person requesting such a ruling must provide all the relevant facts for the situation and may present a rationale for the basis of an interpretation of the law most favorable to the taxpayer. Any misrepresentation or change in the applicable law or the factual situation as presented in the ruling request shall invalidate any such ruling issued. A written ruling may be revoked or amended prospectively if (i) there is a change in the law, a court decision, or the guidelines issued by the department of taxation upon which the ruling was based, or (ii) the assessor notifies the taxpayer of a change in the policy or interpretation upon which the ruling was based. However, any person who acts on a written ruling which later becomes invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which such ruling was in effect.

Sec. 20-13. - Propounding interrogatories to applicant. 
    As one of the means of ascertaining the amount of any license tax, the commissioner of the revenue may propound interrogatories to each applicant under the provisions of this chapter and use such other evidence as he may procure. Such interrogatories shall be answered under oath. Any applicant refusing to answer such interrogatories under oath shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. 
(Code 1963, § 21-7) 
Sec. 20-14. - Estimates to determine tax for beginners, etc. 
(a)  For the purpose of ascertaining the license tax to be paid by any person beginning a new business, employment or profession, and whose license tax is based on gross receipts, gross sales, gross purchases, gross commissions, gross contracts or orders, the licensee shall estimate the basis for measuring the license tax between the date of issuance of the license and the thirty-first of December following. 
(b)  The license tax of every person who was licensed at a definite place of business within the city for only a part of the next preceding license year shall be computed for the then current license year on the basis of an estimate of the amount of gross receipts, gross sales or gross purchases which the licensee will make throughout the then current license year, except that any commission merchant or wholesale merchandise broker shall be licensed on the basis of gross commissions of the next preceding license year or any parts thereof. 
(c)  Every underestimate under this section shall be subject to correction by the commissioner of the revenue, whose duty it shall be to assess such licensee with such additional taxes as may be found to be due after the close of the license year on the basis of gross receipts, gross sales, gross purchases, gross commissions or gross contracts or orders. In case of overestimate, the commissioner of the revenue shall order a refund in the amount of the overpaid tax. 
Sec. 20-14.5. - Exclusions and deductions from "gross receipts". 
(a)  General rule. Gross receipts for license tax purposes shall not include any amount not derived from the exercise of the licensed privilege to engage in a business or profession in the ordinary course of business.

(1)  Amounts received and paid to the United States, the commonwealth or any county, city or town for the Virginia retail sales or use tax, for any local sales tax or any local excise tax on cigarettes, or for any federal or state excise taxes on motor fuels. 
(2)  Any amount representing the liquidation of a debt or conversion of another asset to the extent that the amount is attributable to a transaction previously taxed (e.g., the factoring of accounts receivable created by sales which have been included in taxable receipts even though the creation of such debt and factoring are a regular part of its business).

Sec. 20-25. - Examination and audit of licensee's records.

(b)  If, after an investigation, examination or audit pursuant to this section, it shall appear that purchases, sales, commissions, receipts or other matters pertinent to the assessment have been incorrectly reported or returned, the commissioner of revenue shall assess such person with the proper city license tax. If it shall appear that such purchases, sales, commissions, receipts or other matters pertinent to the assessment have been willfully incorrectly reported or returned, such person shall pay, in addition to such increased license tax assessed, a penalty of fifty (50) percent of such increased assessment. Any incorrect report or return shall be deemed prima facie willful. 
(c)  Any person who shall fail to appear before the commissioner of revenue and produce such records, books and papers, when duly summoned, or who shall refuse to permit the commissioner of revenue to make or cause to be made such other and further investigation and audit of such books and papers, shall be deemed guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.

Notice pursuant to this subsection shall first be attempted in person to the owner of the vehicle. After giving or attempting to give in-person notice, the officer shall post in a conspicuous place on the vehicle a decal (1) indicating that the vehicle is in violation of this section 22-99 and (2) stating that failure to comply with this section may result in the removal and disposal of the vehicle, at its owner's expense. After twenty-four (24) hours of posting the notice: 
(1)  The city or its agent may remove the vehicle; 
(2)  In the event the city or its agent removes the vehicle, the city or its agent may dispose of the vehicle after giving additional notice, of disposal of the vehicle, to the vehicle's owner of record;

(c)  If records of the department of motor vehicles contain no address for the owner or no address of any person shown by the department's records to have a security interest, or if the identity and addresses of the owner and any persons having security interests cannot be determined with reasonable certainty, notice by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice pursuant to this section. Notice by publication may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles. Notice by publication shall be within the time, and shall have the same contents, required by this section for notice by mail. 
(d)  If a vehicle is not reclaimed as provided above, the city or its agent shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 46.2-617 (Sale of vehicle without certificate of title), sell it or cause it to be sold. The purchaser of the vehicle shall take title free of all liens and claims of ownership of others, shall receive a sales receipt, and shall be entitled to apply to and receive from the department of motor vehicles a certificate of title and registration card for the vehicle. The sales receipt shall be sufficient title only for purposes of transferring the vehicle to a third party for demolition, wrecking, or dismantling, and in that case no further titling of the vehicle shall be necessary. From the proceeds of the sale, the city or its agent shall reimburse itself for the expenses of the sale, the cost of towing, preserving, and storing the vehicle which resulted from removing the vehicle, and all notice and publication costs incurred pursuant to this section. Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or any person having a security interest in it, for ninety (90) days, and then be deposited with the treasurer of, and become the property of, the city.

(3)  The city or its agent may remove inoperable motor vehicles, whenever the owner of the premises or of the vehicle, after the above notice, has failed to remove or cause to be removed any such vehicle; 
(4)  In the event the city or its agent removes an inoperable motor vehicle after notice of removal as set forth above, the city or its agent may dispose of the vehicle after giving additional notice to the owner of the premises upon which the vehicle was located and, if different, the owner of record of the vehicle, through registered or certified United States mail, return receipt requested, no more than ten (10) business days after the removal of the vehicle. The notice shall (a) describe the year, make, model, and serial number of the vehicle, (b) set forth the location of the facility where the vehicle is being held, (c) inform the owner of the owner's right to reclaim the vehicle within ten (10) days after the date of such notice upon payment of the cost of removal, (d) state that the failure of the owner to exercise the owner's right to reclaim the vehicle within the time provided may result in its disposal, and (e) state that the owner of the vehicle and, if different, the owner of the premises, may be liable for the cost of removal and disposal of the vehicle; 
(5)  Whenever any inoperable motor vehicle is not reclaimed by its owner by payment of the cost of removal within the time specified in the above-described notice, the vehicle may be disposed of; 
(6)  If an inoperable motor vehicle is not reclaimed as provided above, the city or its agent shall sell the vehicle or cause it to be sold. From the proceeds of the sale, the city or its agent shall reimburse itself for the expenses of sale, and the cost of towing, preserving, and storing which resulted from removing the vehicle. Any remainder from the sale proceeds shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or any persons having security interests in it, for ninety (90) days, and then be deposited with the treasurer of, and become property of, the city; 
(7)  The cost of any such removal and disposal shall be chargeable to the owner of the vehicle and, if different, of the premises from which the vehicle was removed, and may be collected by the city as taxes and levies are collected; 
(8)  Every cost authorized by this section with which the owner of the premises from which the vehicle was removed shall have been assessed shall constitute a lien against the real property, which lien shall continue until actual payment of such cost shall have been made to the city; and 
(9)  Any person aggrieved by a decision of the city in connection with the enforcement of this section may appeal by filing a written notice of appeal with the city manager within seven (7) calendar days of the decision. The notice of appeal shall state the reason for the appeal. The city manager shall designate as appeal officer a person who did not participate in the decision. The appeal officer shall conduct an informal hearing within ten (10) business days after the filing of the notice of appeal. The appeal officer may affirm, modify, or reverse the original decision. The appeal officer's decision shall be announced within five (5) business days after the hearing. The aggrieved person and the appeal officer may agree to extend the ten-day and five-day periods in this subsection. An appeal under this subsection shall stay enforcement of the original decision until the appeal officer's decision has been announced. 
(c)  Any person, firm, or corporation violating any provision of this section may be issued a summons and shall upon conviction thereof be punished by a civil penalty not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the first violation and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for additional violations. Each day that a violation of this section continues shall be a separate offense. The total amount of the civil penalties and the frequency of the offenses shall not, however, exceed the limitations set forth in Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2209 (Civil penalties for violations of zoning ordinance). 
(d)  In the event that three (3) civil penalties are imposed on the same defendant for the same or similar violation, not arising from the same sets of operative facts, within a twenty-four-month period, each subsequent violation shall be a Class 3 misdemeanor.

It is the purpose and intent of this section to make unlawful the willful and malicious damage to, or defacement of, any public or private buildings, facilities, walls, fences, structures, or personal property, and to establish a procedure for the remediation of any damage or defacement, including graffiti, from public and private property, to provide for the recovery of costs of any cleaning, covering, repairing, replacing, removing without limitation (the "remediation") and to provide a measure of rehabilitation, through community service, for those persons guilty of violations of this section. 
(b)  Definitions. 
    Community service supervisor shall be the city manager or his designee who shall have the authority to supervise the court ordered community service program authorized by this section. 
    Defacement shall have the same meaning as graffiti. 
    Graffiti shall mean the unauthorized application by any means of any writing, painting, drawing, etching, scratching, or marking of an inscription, word, figure, or design of any type. 
    Remediate or remediation shall mean the removing, repairing, covering, cleaning, or replacing the defacement or damage to property. 
(c)  Damage or defacement of public or private property prohibited; criminal penalty. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person to deface or damage any public or private buildings, facilities, walls, fences, structures, or personal property. 
(2)  Any person convicted of a violation of subsection (1) shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The punishment for any such violation in which the defacement or damage is (i) more than twenty (20) feet off the ground, (ii) on a railroad or highway overpass, or (iii) committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, as that term is defined by Code of Virginia, § 18.2-46.1, shall include a mandatory minimum fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
(3)  Upon a finding of guilt under this section in any case tried before the court without a jury, in the event the violation constitutes a first offense that results in property damage or loss, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt, upon motion of the defendant, may defer further proceedings and place the defendant on probation pending completion of a plan of community service work. If the defendant fails or refuses to complete the community service as ordered by the court, the court may make final disposition of the case and proceed as otherwise provided. If the community service work is completed as the court prescribes, the court may discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings against him. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt, and is a conviction only for the purposes of applying the provisions of this section in subsequent proceedings. 
(4)  Community service work prescribed by the court under subsection (3) shall include, to the extent feasible, the remediation of any damage or defacement to property within the city, and may include clean-up, beautification, landscaping, or other appropriate community service within the city. Any remediation which is to be done on private property will require the property owner to release the city and its officers and employees from any liability that might arise during the course of performing community service activities on such property. Should the property owner not agree to such a release, the community services supervisor shall report to the court that the community service plan can not be fulfilled according to the orders prescribed by the court. 
(5)  Community service work prescribed by the court under subsection (3) shall be performed under the supervision of the community services supervisor, who shall report on such work to the court imposing the community service work requirement at such times and in such manner as the court may direct. 
(6)  At or before the time of sentencing under this section, the court shall receive and consider any plan for making restitution or performing community service submitted by the defendant, as well as the recommendations of the community service supervisor concerning the plan. 
(7)  The court may order any person convicted of unlawfully defacing property to pay full or partial restitution to the City of Hopewell for costs incurred by the city in remediating the defacement. An order of restitution pursuant to this subsection shall be docketed as provided in Code of Virginia, § 8.01-446 when so ordered by the court or upon written request of the City of Hopewell and may be enforced by the city in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action. 
(8)  No person convicted of a violation of this section shall be placed on probation or have his sentence suspended unless such person shall make at least partial restitution for such property damage or is compelled to perform community services, or both. 
(9)  If the city seeks to remediate the damage or defacement, the city shall give notice to the owner and lessee, if any, of any private property that has been damaged or defaced that, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice, if the owner or lessee does not remediate, or object to the remediation of the damage or defacement, the city may remediate the damage or defacement at the city's expense through its employees and/or agents. In exercising such duties, such agents or employees shall have any and all immunity normally provided to an employee of the city under Code of Virginia, § 15.2-908 and any other immunity provided by law.

The action by the city shall be subject to any limitation on the amount of recovery set forth in the Code of Virginia, § 8.01-43 or other applicable state law. 
(2)  In the event that damage to, or defacement or destruction of, private property is perpetrated by a minor who is living with either or both parents or a legal guardian, the property owner may institute an action, and recover from the parents of the minor, or either of them, or from the legal guardian, the costs for damages suffered by reason of the willful destruction or defacement of, or damage to, private property by the minor. The action by the owner shall be subject to any limitation on the amount of recovery set forth in the Code of Virginia, § 8.01-44 or other applicable state law. 
(e)  Remediation of damage to or defacement of buildings, facilities, walls, fences, structures, and personal property. 
(1)  The city manager is authorized to undertake or contract for the remediation of the damage to or defacement of any public property. 
(2)  The city manager is also authorized to undertake or contract for the remediation of the damage to or defacement of any private property visible from any public right-of-way, in accordance with the following procedures: 
(i)  Prior to such remediation of any damage to or defacement of occupied private property that is visible from a public right-of-way, the city manager shall issue notice to the property owner and the lessee, if any, by certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to the last address listed for the owner and lessee in the city's records. Such notice shall provide: the street address and legal description of the property; that the owner or lessee should take corrective action to remediate the damage or defacement within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice; and that if the damage or defacement is not remediated within the fifteen-day period, the city will begin remediation procedures. 
(ii)  If the defacement occurs on a public or private building, wall, fence, or other structure located on unoccupied property, and the city through its own agents or employees, remediates the defacement after complying with the notice provisions of this section, the actual cost or expenses thereof shall be chargeable to and paid by the owners of such property and may be collected by the locality as taxes are collected. No lien shall be chargeable to the owners of such property unless the city has given a minimum of fifteen (15) days' notice to the property owner prior to the removal of the defacement. 
(iii)  Every charge authorized by subsection (ii) above with which the owner of any such property has been assessed and that remains unpaid shall constitute a lien against such property, ranking on a parity with liens for unpaid local taxes and enforceable in the same manner as provided in Code of Virginia, article 3 § 58.1-3940 et seq. and § 58.1-3965 et seq. The city may waive and release such liens in order to facilitate the sale of the property. Such liens may be waived only as to a purchaser who is unrelated by blood or marriage to the owner and who has no business association with the owner. All such liens shall remain a personal obligation of the owner of the property at the time the liens were imposed. 
(iv)  Before entering upon private property for the purpose of remediating defaced property, the city shall attempt to obtain the consent of the property owner or lessee. 
(3)  Where property is owned by a public entity other than the city, the remediation of the damage or defacement by the city is authorized only after securing the consent of an authorized representative of the public entity having jurisdiction over the property. 
(f)  Authority may be delegated. 
(1)  The city manager may delegate the responsibilities set forth in this section.

Sec. 31-10.2. - Sewer connection fees. 
(a)  Application for sewer service. A property owner desiring sewer service to a parcel of land, or required to connect to the sewer system, must submit an application to the director, or his designee, along with the applicable sewer connection fee. 
(b)  Fees. 
(1)  Connection fee. A property owner who connects to the sewer system shall be charged a connection fee established by city council. The sewer connection fee is to recapture the capital costs for the infrastructure necessary to serve the demands of the property. The fee is based on the size of the water meter that serves the property, or if the property does not receive water service, the size of the water meter that would serve the property if it received water service. The approved fee structure shall be applied effective July 1, 2009 to all new sanitary sewer connections not previously issued a building permit. 
The owner of lot in a plated subdivision that has been approved by city council may receive a fifty (50) percent discount on the sewer connection fee established by city council by prepaying the connection fee for that lot, no later than December 31, 2009. To prepay the connection fee on the lot, the owner of the lot shall pay the current connection fee, less a fifty (50) percent discount to the code enforcement department. The prepayment of the connection fee shall be valid for a period of five (5) years, but not to be transferable to the subsequent owner of the lot. 
(2)  Engineering and inspection fees. The property owner is required to install the sanitary sewer lateral lines necessary to connect to the sewer main line. The line installed by the property owner shall comply with latest recognized version of the International Plumbing Code. The portion of the service lateral connection in the public right-of-way must meet the specifications as determined by the city engineer. Design plans for the sanitary sewer outfall line and service lateral connection lying in the right-of-way shall be approved and permitted by the city engineer prior to the commencement of installation. Once installation is complete, code enforcement officials will inspect the line and connection. The property owner may be charged a fee for such inspection(s). City council shall adopt the inspection fees and charges. 
(c)  Property owner responsible for certain costs. 
(1)  Cost for extending main line. When the sewer main line is not available to the property, the property owner shall pay to the city, in advance, the full cost for extending the main line to the property. 
a.  Such costs shall include any land or utility easement acquisition costs that the city may incur if the line cannot be run along a public right-of-way to the property. 
b.  The cost of extending the sewer line to the property shall be set at a per linear foot as established by city council. 
c.  Should the director determine that there is a need for an oversized line to be installed, or a line longer than may be necessary to serve the property, the additional costs for the augmented line size or length shall not be charged to the property owner. 
d.  If the sewer main line extension work is to be done under a city issued permit and contract agreement, the property owner shall be responsible for the full cost to perform the scope of work as shown on an approved plan. The city may require the property owner to enter into a development agreement and a surety to cover the proposed work. 
(2)  Developers of new subdivisions shall install all sewer lines and facilities internal to the development in accordance with the subdivision ordinance, the design specifications as determined by the city engineer, and development agreements approved by the city engineer. 
(d)  Credit allowed for oversized or extended internal line. 
(1)  If the city requires the property owner to install a sewer line larger than is necessary to serve the development or use proposed for the property, to run a line further, or to make any other improvements not necessitated by the development or use, the property owner shall receive a credit for such augmented costs which may be applied against the connection fee. The amount of the credit shall be the difference in costs of the sewer line proposed by the property owner and the augmented requirements imposed by the city. The director shall establish the amount of the credit based on cost estimates provided by the city engineer. 
(e)  Installment payments. Upon written request, any property owner may enter into an agreement with the city, at the sole discretion of the city, to pay the connection fee for the property in up to twelve (12) equal monthly installments which shall include a service fee of one and one-half (1.5) percent per month. 
(f)  Exemption from connection fee. No connection fee shall be charged for a connection where a three-quarter (3/4) of an inch or smaller water meter is installed that serves any business that is located in an authorized enterprise zone as designated by the Commonwealth of Virginia if the business is connecting to the city sewer system for the first time. 
(g)  Change in use. Should the zoning use, use group, or occupancy change to a more intensive use, or the existing use be expanded or converted to a more intensive use and new construction or reconstruction of existing structures occurs, a new connection fee shall be required.

Sec. 31-11. - Sewer user charge and charge for industrial cost recovery. 
(a)  Every person whose property is connected to and who is using the sanitary sewer facilities of the city shall pay a sewer user charge, which charge shall be either a fixed amount or shall be based on the consumption of water by such person as shown in the water bill as submitted by the water purveyor of the city; and such charge shall be paid by the person in whose name the water bill is registered and rendered by the water purveyor, at such rates as are from time to time by resolution or ordinance set by city council. 
(b)  The director shall review the wastewater sewer charges periodically to determine if they are adequate to cover the costs incurred by the city for wastewater collection and treatment. Such comparison shall be based on previous operation and maintenance costs. Should costs exceed wastewater sewer charges, the rate will be revised accordingly. 
(c)  In addition to the charges as set forth hereinabove, a charge will be levied upon all industrial users for industrial cost recovery in compliance with the city's industrial cost recovery system. If any user can show that a significant portion of his metered water flow does not enter the sewerage system, he may, at his expense, install a waste flow meter, of a type approved by the director, at a point of discharge to the public sewer. The director shall check the accuracy of such meter periodically, but not less than once per year. Should the meter be found in error, a correction shall be made in all flow quantities metered since the last time the meter was checked, equal to the percentage in inaccuracy. The user shall pay or be refunded the applicable charge based on the corrected readings. 
(d)  Wastewater flows entering a public sewer but not originating from the water purveyor, or which are not metered, will be estimated by the director and charged as if the flow were metered. Lump sum fees for discharge of holding tank wastes shall be established by the director and approved by city council, taking into account the strength and character of the waste.

(a)  No industrial user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will cause interference or pass-through. This general prohibition and the specific prohibitions listed below apply to all industrial users of the POTW, whether or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other federal, state or local pretreatment standards or requirement. 
(b)  No industrial user shall discharge or permit the discharge or infiltration into the POTW any of the following: 
(1)  Any wastewater having a temperature higher than one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius) or any substance which causes the temperature of the total wastewater treatment plant influent to increase at a rate of ten (10) degrees Fahrenheit (five (5) degrees Celsius) or more per hour, or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed one hundred thirteen (113) degrees Fahrenheit (forty-five (45) degrees Celsius). 
(2)  Any fats or greases, including but not limited to petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through. 
(3)  Any explosive or flammable liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW. Included in this prohibition are wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty (140) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty (60) degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR Section 261.21. At no time shall two (2) successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the POTW or at any point in the POTW be more than five (5) percent or any single reading over ten (10) percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. 
(4)  Any substance which may cause the treatment plant effluent, or any other residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or may otherwise interfere with the reclamation process. 
(5)  Any substance which may cause the city to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal regulations or permits issued under Section 405 of the act or under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act or other federal or state requirements applicable to the sludge use and disposal practices being used by the city.

(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-57. - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
    Industrial users subject to national categorical pretreatment standards are required to comply with applicable standards as set out in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471 and incorporated herein. Upon promulgation of national categorical pretreatment standards for a particular user, the said standard, if more stringent than the limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that category, shall, when effective, immediately supersede the limitations and conditions imposed under this chapter. The director shall notify all known affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under division 3 of this article and 9VAC25-31-780. 
(1)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director should impose an alternative limit using a flow weighted analysis from the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR Section 403.6(e), as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-780. 
(2)  Where a pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(c), as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-780. Once incorporated into its control mechanism, the individual user must comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(3)  An industrial user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard from EPA if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR Section 403.13, as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-780, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(4)  Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted by the director to reflect the presence of pollutants in an industrial user's intake water (i.e., net gross adjustment) in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.15, as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-780. 
(5)  Subject to the procedural and substantive requirements of 40 CFR Section 403.7, as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-790, the director may grant removal credits to an industrial user to reflect the HRWTF's removal from the POTW of pollutants specified in the categorical pretreatment standards. The removal credit shall be equal to or less than the HRWTF's consistent removal rate. Upon being granted a removal credit, an industrial user shall calculate its revised discharge limits in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.7(a)(4), as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-790. 
(6)  Subject to the procedural and substantive requirements of 9VAC25-31-780 C. 5, when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the director convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director. The director may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the following conditions in subsections (6)a.1. through 5. of this subsection as follows: 
a.  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
1.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its control mechanism; 
2.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
3.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
4.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
5.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
b.  An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
1.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
2.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
3.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty (20) percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection (6)a.3. of this subsection. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the director must reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
4.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection (6)a.1. of this subsection as long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
c.  When developing equivalent mass limits, the director: 
1.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
2.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, must reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
3.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection (6)d. of this subsection. The industrial user must also be in compliance with 9VAC25-31-890 (regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
d.  The director may not express limits in terms of mass for pollutants such as pH, temperature, radiation, or other pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass. 
(7)  The director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards in 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users under the following conditions: When converting such limits to concentration limits, the director must use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by section 31-60. The conversion is at the discretion of the director. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-58. - State pretreatment standards. 
    Industrial users are required to comply with any applicable state pretreatment standards and requirements adopted by the department in 9VAC25-31-730-900. These standards and requirements are incorporated herein. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-59. - Local limits. 
(a)  The city and the director reserve the right to establish, by ordinance or in permits, any limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 31-1 of this chapter or the general and specific prohibitions in section 31-56 of this chapter. 
(b)  The director may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of section 31-56 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-60. - Dilution. 
    Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to achieve compliance with pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases in which the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-61. - Discharge of toxic materials. 
    No person shall discharge into the POTW any liquids containing toxic materials in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, which would tend to injure or interfere with any treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals or create any hazard in the receiving waters or the effluent of the treatment plant. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-62. - City's alternatives as to prohibited discharges. 
    If wastewaters containing any substance described in subsection (b) of section 31-56 of this chapter are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the POTW, the director may take any appropriate action necessary to: 
(1)  Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater. 
(2)  Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications will eliminate the discharge of such substances to a degree as to be acceptable to the city and so as not to violate the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Require pretreatment, including storage facilities or flow equalization if necessary, to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics or substances so that the discharge will not violate the provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  Require the person making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay any added cost of handling and treating excess loads imposed on the POTW. 
(5)  Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or necessary to achieve the purpose of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-63. - Pretreatment or flow control facilities requirement. 
(a)  Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 31-56 of this chapter, within the time limitations specified by the director. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the director shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be acceptable to the director before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the director under the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require an industrial user to restrict the user's discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage from industrial wastewaters, and impose such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(c)  The director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(d)  Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-64. - Grease, oil and sand separators. 
(a)  When required by the director, the user of any property serviced by a sanitary sewer carrying industrial wastewater shall install separators as necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease, sand, oil or any other matters that may violate the provisions of subsection 31-56(b)(2), (3) or (7) of this chapter. 
(b)  When required by the director, all sanitary sewers of the user into which waste products are discharged shall be directed to one (1) or more such separators before connecting with the public sanitary sewers. Such separators shall be installed by the user and be accessible for maintenance purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-65. - Designation of separate sources of constituents. 
(a)  Firm with multiple buildings. Where a business or industrial firm is operating as an integrated manufacturing complex, involving more than one (1) building and having separate sewer connections within the same contributory area, such firm may be considered as one (1) unit with multiple sewers. An analysis for each building sewer, based on separate samples and flows taken at each building sewer, may be combined and the weighted average of the results thus obtained may, consistent with section 31-57(1), be used as the measure of the constituent concentration of the wastes discharged into the POTW by such firm. 
(b)  A block and lot with multiple buildings. Where a parcel of real property consisting of one (1) block and lot is occupied by multiple buildings having tenants with unrelated manufacturing processes, each building shall be considered a separate source of constituents. 
(c)  Multitenanted industrial buildings. Where a parcel of real property consisting of one (1) block and lot, or lots, is occupied by a multitenanted industrial building connected to the POTW by one (1) or more sewers and the tenants in said building discharge wastewater into the drainage system, each tenant shall be considered a separate source of constituents and the constituent concentration shall be determined at sampling locations selected by the director for each source. 
(d)  Industrial park or industrial building complex. Where a parcel of real property consists of more than one (1) block and lot, and one (1) or more buildings on said parcel occupy a single block, each such building or buildings may be considered a block and lot with multiple buildings and the constituent concentration discharged from said building or buildings to the POTW shall be determined as prescribed under subsection (b) of this section. 
(e)  Tenant activities. Any tenant of such real property as described in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section shall comply with all of the rules and regulations of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-66. - Special agreements. 
(a)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement between the city and any user of the POTW whereby a wastewater of unusual strength or character may be accepted into the POTW subject to agreement between the two (2) parties. No such agreement, however, shall be made which would allow the combined influent to the treatment plant to exceed limitations which will adversely affect operation of the plant. The terms and conditions of such agreement are subject to change by the director during the life of the agreement as required for process control and/or changes to VPDES permit limitations. Notification of such changes will be made similar to permit changes as outlined in section 31-75 of this chapter. 
(b)  In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with any pretreatment standard. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15, as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-870. Industrial users may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standards from the EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that categorical pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-850.

(9)  Number of employees and hours of work. 
(10)  Line diagram and basic information, including capacity, of existing or proposed spill containment areas and installations. 
(11)  Listing of raw materials and chemicals that are used in the manufacturing process and are or could be discharged into the POTW. 
(12)  The SIC number(s) of the applicant's facility according to the Standard Industrial Classification Manual. 
(13)  If additional industrial user operation and maintenance or pretreatment techniques or installations will be required to meet the applicable pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standards. 
a.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). 
b.  No increment of progress referred to in subsection a. shall exceed nine (9) months. 
c.  Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the director including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than six (6) months elapse between such progress reports to the director.

(2)  No increment referred to in subsection (1) above shall exceed nine (9) months; 
(3)  The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the director no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance, including, at a minimum, whether or not the user complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date, and, if not, the date it expects to comply, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the director. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-89. - Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. 
(a)  Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in subsections (b)(4) to (6) of section 31-87 of this chapter. 
(b)  For all industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
(c)  All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 31-100 of this chapter. 
(d)  For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR Section 403.6(c), as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-780, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-90. - Periodic compliance reports. 
(a)  Any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of that pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the director during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the director, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical pretreatment standards, and a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. If an industrial user is subject to categorical standards with only production-based limits, actual average production rate data for the reporting period must be given. In addition, this report shall include a record of measures or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the discharge reported in subsection (b)(4) of section 31-87, except that the director may require more detailed reporting of flows. At the discretion of the director and in consideration of such factors as the local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the director may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
(b)  The director may authorize the industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  The director may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility, provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(2)  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the permit or other equivalent individual control mechanism, but in no case longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent control mechanism. 
(3)  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one (1) sampling of the facility's process wastewater, prior to any treatment present at the facility, that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 31-100 of this chapter, and include the certification statement in 9VAC25-31-780 A 2 b. Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(4)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the director must be included as a condition in the user's control mechanism. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the director for three (3) years after expiration of the waiver. 
(5)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's control mechanism by the director, the industrial user must certify on each report, with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user: 
"Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR [specify applicable national pretreatment standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under 9VAC25-31-840 E 1." 
(6)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of subdivision (a) of this subsection or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the director, and notify the director. 
(7)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(c)  The director may reduce the requirement in the subdivision (a) of this subsection to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the approval authority, where the industrial user meets all of the following conditions: 
(1)  The industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following: 
a.  0.01 percent of the design dry weather hydraulic capacity of the POTW, or five thousand (5,000) gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the industrial user discharges in batches; 
b.  0.01 percent of the design dry weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and 
c.  0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for which approved local limits were developed by the POTW in accordance with 9VAC25-31-770 C and D. 
(2)  The industrial user has not been in significant noncompliance, as defined in 9VAC25-31-800, for any time in the past two (2) years; 
(3)  The industrial user does not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section; 
(4)  The industrial user must notify the director immediately of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer meet conditions of subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this subsection. Upon notification, the industrial user must immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting in subdivision (a) of this subsection; and 
(5)  The director must retain documentation to support the director's determination that a specific industrial user qualifies for reduced reporting requirements under subdivision (c) of this subsection for a period of three (3) years after the expiration of the term of the control mechanism. 
(d)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(e)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director using the procedures prescribed in section 31-99 of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(f)  Periodic compliance reports shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The director shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(g)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 31-100 of this chapter. 
(h)  Where the director has imposed mass limitations on an industrial user as provided for in section 31-60 of this chapter, the periodic compliance reports shall indicate the mass of pollutants from the user's discharge regulated by pretreatment standards. 
(i)  For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the director in accordance with subsection (2) of section 31-57 of this chapter, the periodic compliance report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the periodic compliance report shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. 
(j)  For industrial users subject to a local limit requiring compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the director or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-91. - Sampling and analysis results.

(1)  Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the director at least once every (6) months (on dates specified by the director) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of pollutants required to be reported by the director. 
(2)  These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the procedures prescribed in section 31-99 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-93. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify in writing the director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the department of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261 or 9VAC20-60-261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261 or 9VAC20-60-261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 31-96 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of this division. 
(b)  Industrial users are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR Sections 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharges of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR Sections 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), require a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the department of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This section does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued under this chapter, or any applicable federal or state law or regulation. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-94. - Slug discharge control plan. 
    Each industrial user having the ability to cause interference with the POTW or to violate the regulatory provisions of this chapter shall provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. All industrial users whose wastewater includes or could include compatible or incompatible pollutants in amounts great enough to cause interference with the POTW must have detailed plans on file at the HRWTF showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection. Plans are subject to the approval of the director. Existing sources that store hazardous substances shall not contribute to the POTW unless a spill prevention plan has been approved by director. New sources shall not begin discharge unless a slug discharge control plan has been approved by the director. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. At a minimum, the slug discharge control plan shall contain the following elements: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharged, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under section 31-56(b) of this chapter, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five (5) days; 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-95. - Unanticipated discharge. 
(a)  Immediate notification. In the case of an accidental or deliberate discharge of compatible or incompatible pollutants which cause interference with the POTW or violate regulatory requirements of this chapter, it shall be the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the HRWTF of the incident. The notification shall include name of caller, location and time of discharge, type of wastewater, concentration, and volume. Significant industrial users are required to notify the director immediately of any changes at their facilities affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(b)  Written report. Within five (5) days following such an accidental or deliberate discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the director a detailed written report on forms to be provided by the director describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Follow-up reports may be required by the director as needed. Such report, or reports, shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such report relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the director, result in the revocation of the discharger's wastewater discharge permit. 
(c)  Notice to user employees. A notice in English and the language of common use shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge of a prohibited material. Employers shall ensure that all employees who are in a position to cause, discover, or observe such an accidental discharge are advised of the emergency notification procedures. 
(d)  Additional remedies. In addition to remedies available to the director set forth elsewhere in this chapter, if the HRWTF or the city is fined by the Commonwealth of Virginia or EPA for violation of the city's VPDES permit or violation of applicable standards as a result of an industrial spill or slug discharge of a compatible or incompatible pollutant, then the fine, including all HRWTF or city legal, sampling, analytical testing, and any other related costs, shall be charged to the responsible industry. Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies the director or city may have, at law or in equity, under this chapter or state or federal statutes and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-96. - Reports of changed conditions. 
    Each industrial user shall notify the director of any planned substantial changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ninety (90) days before the change or immediately after the user has knowledge such change will occur. 
(1)  The director may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 31-72 of this chapter. 
(2)  The director may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit under section 31-72 of this chapter or modify an existing individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit under section 31-75 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, substantial changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty (20) percent or greater, the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, or any other change the director finds necessary for the user to report in order to prevent pass-through or interference. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-97. - Recordkeeping. 
    Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain and make available for inspection and copying all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records or information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and documentation associated with best management practices under subsection 31-59(b). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed and who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this chapter. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any unresolved limitation concerning the user or the city, or when requested by the director or the regional administrator. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-98. - Monitoring, sampling and measuring facilities and equipment. 
(a)  The director may require any industrial user to construct, at the user's expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the waste discharged, together with sampling or metering equipment to be provided, installed and operated at the user's expense. Such inspection chamber or control manhole shall be situated on the user's premises and shall be constructed and operated to permit accurate sampling and flow measurements of all wastes discharged. Where conditions do not permit measurement of all discharges from one (1) industrial facility at a single control manhole, multiple control manholes shall be provided. The control manhole shall be located so as to permit access by city representatives, provide sufficient space for storage of samples and equipment and allow for accurate sampling. Such facilities shall be located so that samples may be taken safely and easily and shall not be obstructed by landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activity of the industrial user. 
(b)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the director's requirements and all applicable city construction standards and specifications. When, in the judgment of the director, an existing user requires a monitoring facility, the user will be so notified in writing. Construction must be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification, unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the director. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-99. - Sampling and analysis. 
(a)  Except as indicated in subsection (b) below, the industrial user shall collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide representative samples of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(c)  The user shall take a minimum of one (1) representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. 
(d)  Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated facility if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR Section 403.6(e), as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-780, in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(e), as incorporated by 9VAC25-31-780, this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the director. 
(e)  All pollutants analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or permit shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(f)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in section 31-87 and 31-89 (40CFR 403.12(b) and (d)) of this chapter, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section 31-90 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)) of this chapter, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

Users shall allow the city manager, director and other authorized representatives of the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, observation, copying, measurement or conducting surveys, sampling in accordance with this chapter, examining reports and records required by this chapter or by the director in accordance with this chapter, and any other duties necessary to monitor and enforce compliance with this chapter. 
(2)  Entry shall normally be made during daylight or operating hours. However, the right is reserved for the director to enter the industrial user's premises at any hour of any day the city manager, director or other authorized representative of the city deems necessary as a result of abnormal or emergency circumstances. While performing necessary work on the user's premises, the director or other authorized representative of the city shall observe all reasonable safety rules applicable to the premises established by the user, and the user shall be held harmless for injury or death to city employees, and the city shall indemnify the user against loss or damage to its property and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the user, except as such may be caused by willful acts, negligence or failure of the user to maintain safe conditions. 
(3)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city manager, director and authorized representatives of the city access to the industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the city manager, director or other authorized representative of the city has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and the director or city is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from a judicial officer of the city authorized to issue such warrant. 
(c)  Confidential information. Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and inspection and sampling activities by the city and the director shall be available to the public without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under Code of Virginia, § 59.1-336. In addition, the director and the city shall be subject to the confidentiality requirements set forth in Code of Virginia, § 62.1-44.21 and 9VAC25-31-860. 
(1)  Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR Section 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(2)  When requested and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the VPDES program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-107. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The director shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by HRWTF, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(a)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of the wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits; 
(b)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of the wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, multiplied by the applicable criteria TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(c)  Any other discharge violation (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limits or narrative standard) that the director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through, including endangering the health of HRWTF personnel or the general public; 
(d)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(e)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a consent order, compliance order, or wastewater discharge permit for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(f)  Failure to provide within forty-five (45) days after the due date any reports required by this chapter or orders or permits issued under this chapter, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(g)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(h)  Any other violation(s), which may include violations of best management practices, that the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-108. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Voluntary program. Should an industrial user present to the director, at any time prior to being required to do so, information, data, plans, schedules and the like relating to a proposed procedure for the prevention of discharges in violation of the provisions of this chapter, the director may receive such material and initiate procedures for the preparation of a consent order under subsection (c) of this section. The presentation of material to the director, the acceptance of such material by the director, or commencement of procedures for the issuance of a consent order shall not prevent the director from issuing any notice of violation under subsection (b) of this section, nor does it exempt any industrial user from the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Notification of violation. Whenever the director finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating a provision of this chapter, any order or permit issued under this chapter, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon the user a written notice of violation. Within ten (10) calendar days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take emergency action without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(c)  Consent order. The director is hereby empowered to enter into agreements, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing a consent order with the industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such consent orders include specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the consent order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as the orders issued pursuant to subsections (e) and (f) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(d)  Show cause hearing. The city manager may order any industrial user which causes or contributes to a violation of any provision of this chapter, any order or permit issued under this chapter, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before the city manager and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on an authorized representative of the industrial user. Whether or not the industrial user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date. 
(e)  Compliance orders. When the city manager finds that an industrial user has violated or is violating any provision of this chapter, any order or permit issued under this chapter, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. Furthermore, the city manager may continue to require such additional self-monitoring for at least ninety (90) days after consistent compliance has been achieved, after which time the self-monitoring conditions in the discharge permit shall control. 
(f)  Cease and desist orders. When the city manager finds that an industrial user has violated or is violating any provision of this chapter, any order or permit issued under this chapter, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an order to the industrial user to cease and desist any and all such violations and direct the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements, and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Such user shall be notified of the city manager's remedial or preventive action and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (d) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. 
(1)  The director or his designee may suspend the wastewater discharge permit of an industrial user for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, interferes with the operation of the treatment plant, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(2)  Any industrial user notified of a suspension of its wastewater discharge permit shall immediately terminate or eliminate its contribution. In the event of an industrial user's failure to immediately comply with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the treatment plant, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director shall allow the industrial user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings set forth under subsections (d) and (f) of this section or section 31-109 of this chapter are initiated against the user. 
(3)  An industrial user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement to the director describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence prior to the date of any show cause or injunctive relief hearing under subsection (d) of this section and section 31-109 of this chapter, respectively. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-109. - Injunctive relief. 
    Whenever an industrial user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, any order or permit issued under this chapter or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director or the city, through the city attorney, may petition the circuit court of the city for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as may be appropriate, to restrain the industrial user from violating such provision, order, permit, standard, or requirement or to compel the specific performance of the provision, permit, order, standard, or requirement. Such other action as may be appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by the director or the city. The court shall grant an injunction without requiring a showing of a lack of an adequate remedy at law. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-110. - Civil penalties. 
(a)  Any industrial user that has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, any order or permit issued under this chapter, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term average pretreatment standard, penalties shall accrue for each business day during the period of the violation. 
(b)  The director and city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the director and city. 
(c)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the industrial user's violation, corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the industrial user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(d)  Where appropriate, the director may accept mitigation projects in lieu of the payment of civil penalties where the project provides a valuable service to the city and the industrial user's expense in undertaking the project is at least one hundred fifty (150) percent of the civil penalty. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-111. - Criminal prosecution. 
(a)  Any industrial user that willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, any order or permit issued under this chapter, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. 
(b)  Any industrial user that knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed or required to be maintained under any provision of this chapter or wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this chapter, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. 
(c)  In the event of a second conviction, the industrial user shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per violation per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. 
(Ord. No. 2008-18, 10-14-08) 
Sec. 31-112. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (2), below, are met. 
(2)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset: 
1.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance; and 
4.  If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days. 
(3)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(4)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(5)  Industrial users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 31-56 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge would cause pass-through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged that caused the pass-through or interference and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass-through or interference; or 
(2)  No applicable local limit exists, but the discharge, directly prior to and during the pass-through or interference, did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user's prior discharge activity when the city was regularly in compliance with its VPDES permit, and in the case of interference, with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
    This defense does not apply to the specific prohibitions in subsections (3), (8), and (12) of section 31-56 of this chapter. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility, and 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  Permissible bypass. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is also for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection. 
(3)  Notice. 
a.  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  An industrial user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and time, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue. The submission shall also contain steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written submission on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  Prohibited bypass. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
1.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime; and 
3.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this subsection. 
Condition 2. above is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during a normal period of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance. 
b.  The director may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (4)a. of this subsection.

Sec. 34-180. - Procedures for qualifying; general provisions. 
(a)  Procedures. As a requisite for qualifying for partial tax exemption for the rehabilitation, renovation, or replacement of a structure, the owner of the real property upon which the structure is located shall simultaneously with making application for a building permit to construct, rehabilitate, or renovate such structure, file with the real estate assessor, an application to qualify such structure for partial exemption from taxation. Upon receipt of an application for tax exemption, the real estate assessor shall determine the then assessed value of the structure prior to commencement of new construction, rehabilitation or, renovation, which shall serve as the base value for determining whether the new construction or the rehabilitation/renovation increases the assessed value of such structure by the minimum amount as provided in this article. The application to qualify for tax exemption shall be effective until December 31 of the second calendar year following the year in which the application is submitted. If by such expiration date, the new construction, rehabilitation or renovation has not progressed to such a point that the assessed value of the real estate is at least said minimum percentage greater than the base value of such structure, the approved application becomes null and void and no exemption shall be allowed. A new application to qualify for tax exemption may be filed, accompanied by a payment of an additional fee and the establishment of a new base value. The initial application to qualify for the rehabilitated, renovated or replacement real estate structure tax exemption, and any subsequent application, must be accompanied by payment of a nonrefundable fee in the sum of one hundred twenty-five ($125.00), which fee shall be applied to offset the cost of processing such application, making required assessments, and making inspections to determine the progress of the work. During the period between the receipt of the application and the time at which the assessor shall ascertain that the real estate has increased in value by at least the minimum percentage, the real estate assessor shall, prior to December 31, make annual inspections of the progress of the rehabilitation, renovation or replacement undertaken, and the owner of the property shall be subject to taxation upon the full value of the improvements to the property. An owner may, at any time prior to November 1 of any calendar year in which rehabilitation, renovation or replacement of a structure is complete, submit a written request to the assessor to inspect the structure to determine if it then qualifies for the rehabilitated, renovated, or replacement property exemption. When it is determined that at least the minimum percentage increase in assessed value (base value is exceeded by the applicable percentage or more) has occurred within the qualifying period, the tax exemption shall become effective beginning on January 1 of the next calendar year. 
(b)  Credit. The owner of property qualifying for partial exemption of real estate taxes because of rehabilitation, renovation or replacement of a structure shall be issued a bill annually in the amount of the actual taxes based on assessed value reduced by the rehabilitated, renovated or replacement exemption credit allowed. The exemption credit shall be the difference in taxes computed upon the base value, and the taxes that are computed on the initial value of the rehabilitated, renovated, or replacement structure once it qualifies for the exemption. An increase in assessment occurring after the first year of such rehabilitated, renovated or replacement structure shall not qualify for an increase in such exemption. No portion of any credit (partial exemption) shall be allowed in any year for any real estate when such portion of a credit would reduce the tax below what it would be for the base value of the real estate. No portion of any unused or unavailable credit may be used in any subsequent year. 
(c)  Exemption runs with land. Exemption from taxation of real property qualifying for the rehabilitation, renovation or replacement exemption shall run with the land and for the benefit of any owner of such property during each of the years of exemption as defined in the appropriate table. 
(d)  Improvements on vacant land. No improvements made upon vacant land defined in the zoning ordinance for single or multi-family purpose use shall be eligible for partial exemption from real estate taxation. 
(e)  New detached real estate shall not qualify for exemption. 
(f)  Methods of determining base value. In determining the base value of a structure and if the rehabilitation, renovation, or replacement results in the necessary minimum increase over such base value, the assessor shall employ usual and customary methods of assessing real estate. 
(g)  No property which is already subject to any tax abatement shall be eligible for further abatement under this article. 
(h)  Only property listed as a permissible use, as of the application date, in the zoning ordinance in the district it occupies shall be eligible for abatement under this article.

Deviations from approved plans or failure to comply with any requirements, conditions or safeguards shall constitute a violation of these zoning regulations. 
2.  The granting of the planned development rezoning, and the approval of the concept plan, with or without specified modifications, shall not constitute the recording of a plat nor shall it authorize the issuance of building permits.

In no case shall such deviations include the addition or elimination of any building shown on the approved concept plan, increase the density of a PUD or PMH development or increase the floor area of a PSC development. Any changes not authorized by this paragraph shall require resubmission of the concept plan in accordance with the procedures contained in this article. 
6.  The first site plan shall be submitted within one (1) year after the date of approval of the development plan. If a site plan is not submitted within said period, approval of the concept plan, and consequent authority to submit a site plan, shall terminate any development by the applicant in accordance with the PUD, PMH and PSC regulations, and shall require a resubmission of a concept plan in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. Within thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of said one (1) year period, the applicant may apply to the city manager for an extension of time within which to submit a site plan in conformity with the approved concept plan. The city manager may grant such extension, upon good cause shown by the applicant, but extension shall not under any circumstances exceed an additional one (1) year period; and no more than two (2) such extensions may be granted. If such application is denied, approval of the concept plan, and consequent authority to submit a site plan, shall terminate at the end of said one (1) year period. Upon termination of authority to develop as herein provided, the city council may initiate a reclassification of the subject property to an appropriate zoning district other than PUD, PMH or PSC. 
7.  No building permit shall be issued for any building or structure not indicated on the approved site plan. 
ARTICLE IX. - DOWNTOWN CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (B-1)[10] 
Statement of intent. 
    The district is intended to provide for an urban mix of retail, office, service, hotel, residential and civic functions for the city's historic downtown business core. The location of the district requires that uses be compatible with nearby residential housing and with the area generally. The district is intended to be a predominantly pedestrian area with shops and storefronts close to the road, pedestrian in scale, and having street trees and limited off-street parking. The history of the area will be retained with the preservation of historic structures and the replication of historic styles in additions and expansions. The core of the downtown district should exude the vitality of the interaction of people and activities. 
    This district is intended for the conduct of business to which the public requires direct and frequent access, but which is not characterized either by constant heavy truck traffic, other than stocking and delivery of light retail goods, or by any other nuisance factors other than those occasioned by incidental light and noise from the congregation of people, passenger vehicles, business offices, newspaper offices and restaurants.

1.  New development shall be compatible with the pedestrian scale and historic character of the downtown. New or altered buildings should be generally consistent in height, scale, massing (shape) and materials with existing structures in the downtown. The intent of this is to insure functional and visual compatibility, not to specifically encourage imitation of past architectural styles. Nothing herein shall preclude the use of imitation or artificial materials or elements, so long as such materials and elements are similar in appearance, style, detail and design to the materials found within the downtown and consistent with the guidelines and criteria contained herein and in the downtown master plan. 
2.  No building exterior (whether front, side or rear) shall consist of architectural materials inferior in quality, appearance or detail to any other exterior of the same building. Nothing in this section shall preclude the use of different materials on different exteriors if representative of good architectural design but shall preclude the use of inferior materials on sides that face adjoining property. No portion of a building constructed of cinder block, vinyl siding, or corrugated and/or sheet metal shall be permitted; provided, however, that cinder block that is covered by an acceptable façade so that the block is not visible, shall be permitted. 
3.  Buildings shall be designed to impart harmonious proportions and to avoid monotonous facades or large bulky masses. Buildings shall possess architectural variety, but shall be compatible with existing structures, especially nearby structures of high historic interest. New or remodeled buildings shall enhance an overall cohesive downtown character as reflected in existing structures. This character shall be achieved through the use of design elements, including, but not limited to, materials, articulation of doors and windows, sculptural or textural relief of facades, architectural ornamentation, varied roof lines or other appurtenances such as lighting fixtures and/or planting as described in these guidelines and the downtown master plan. 
4.  Architectural treatment of all buildings shall be compatible with buildings located within the same block or directly across any road, as determined by the review committee. At locations where the existing buildings do not conform, the review committee may approve a new architectural treatment or theme. Compatibility may be achieved through the use of similar building massing, materials, scale, colors or other architectural features. 
J. - Signage. 
1.  Sign placement. 
a.  Signs shall be placed so that they do not obstruct architectural elements and details that define the design of the building, and the signage of adjacent businesses.

5.  Materials. 
a.  Signs shall be made only of traditional sign materials such as wood, glass, gold leaf, raised individual metal or painted wood letters, or painted letters on wood, metal, or glass. 
b.  Form letters shall not be permitted.

b.  Boxed or curved fabric awnings may be used on non-historical buildings. 
2.  Design and placement. 
a.  Awnings shall be placed within the storefront, porch, door or window openings so as to not obscure architectural elements of the building or damage the building façade.

3.  Evidence of such required approval shall be a certificate of appropriateness issued by the review committee. 
4.  Application for a certificate of appropriateness required by the article shall be made to the director of development or his designee. 
M. - Downtown design review committee. 
1.  A review committee is hereby established and shall be known as the downtown design review committee, hereafter referred to as the "review committee." The membership of the review committee shall consist of no less than three (3) nor more than five (5) members who shall be appointed by city council to serve staggered terms. At least one (1) member shall be a downtown property owner, another member shall be a downtown business owner, and the remaining member or members shall have knowledge of, and demonstrated interest in, the historic character of the city, and knowledge or expertise deemed useful to the work of the review committee.

A member may be re-appointed to additional terms after being out of office for at least one (1) four-year term. 
2.  The review committee shall elect from its own membership a chairman and a vice chairman who shall serve annual terms as such and may succeed themselves.

A quorum shall be a majority of the membership. A quorum shall be present for official business to be conducted at any meeting and for any action to be taken. The review committee shall meet monthly after notification by the director of development of an application for a certificate of appropriateness or permit requiring action by the review committee. The review committee shall take action on any matter properly before it no later than sixty (60) days after its first meeting to discuss such matter, unless the time is extended with the written consent of the applicant. The review committee shall not reconsider any decision made by it, or entertain any application or request that it deems to be substantially similar to an application or request that has previously been denied, for a period of one (1) year from the date of denial, except in cases where an applicant resubmits his application amended as provided in this article within ninety (90) days after the date of denial of the initial application. 
4.  In the case of disapproval or denial of the erection, reconstruction, alteration, or restoration of a building or structure, the review committee shall briefly state its reasons for such disapproval in writing, and it may make recommendations to the applicant with respect to suggested changes, the appropriateness of design, arrangement, texture, material, color, location and the like of a building or structure involved. In the case of disapproval accompanied by such recommendations, the applicant may amend and resubmit his application within ninety (90) days of such disapproval or denial if such application has been amended to comply with all of the recommendations of the review committee.

O. - Criteria for granting a certificate of appropriateness. 
1.  Before a certificate of appropriateness is issued for the erection, reconstruction, alteration or restoration of a building or structure in the district, the review committee shall consider: 
a.  The historical or architectural value and significance of the building or structure and its relationship to or congruity with the historic value of the land, place and area in the district upon which it is proposed to be located, constructed, reconstructed, altered, or restored. 
b.  The appropriateness of the exterior architectural features of such building or structure to such land, place or area and its relationship to or congruity with the exterior architectural features of other land, places, areas, buildings or structures in the district and environs. 
2.  Before a certificate of appropriateness is issued for the demolition of a building or structure which exists in the district, the review committee shall consider: 
a.  Is the building of such architectural or historic interest that its removal or disturbance would be to the detriment of the public interest? 
b.  Is the building of such interest or significance that it could be made into a national, state or local historic landmark? 
c.  Is the building of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture and/or material that it could not be reproduced, or could be reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense? 
d.  Would retention of the building help preserve the historic character of the district? 
e.  Would retention of the building help preserve a historic interest in a place or an area of the city? 
f.  Would retention of the building promote the general welfare by maintaining and increasing real estate values; generating business; creating new positions; attracting tourists, students, writers, historians, artists and artisans; attracting new residents; encouraging study and interest in American history; stimulating interest and study in architecture and design; educating citizens in American culture and heritage; and making the city a more attractive and desirable place in which to live? 
3.  The review committee shall not consider detailed designs, interior arrangements, or features of a building or structure which are not subject to public view from a public street, public way, or other public place, except to the extent necessary to do so for the purpose of preventing the location, construction, reconstruction, alteration or repair of a building or structure that will be incongruous with the preservation and protection of the historic aspects, settings and environment of the district and other buildings, structures, land, places of areas therein. 
P. - Issuance of certificate of appropriateness. 
    Upon approval by the review committee of any erection, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or demolition, a certificate of appropriateness, signed by the committee chairman and bearing the date of issuance, but subject to the provisions of this article shall be made available to the applicant. 
Q. - Expiration of certificate of appropriateness. 
    Any certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to this article shall expire twelve (12) months from the date of issuance if the work authorized by said certificate has not commenced, or if any such work is suspended or abandoned for a period of twelve (12) months after being commenced. Any period or periods of time during which the right to use any such certificate is stayed pursuant to this article or by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be excluded from the computation of the twelve (12) month period. 
R. - Appeals from downtown design review committee. 
    Any applicant aggrieved by a final decision of the review committee shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Hopewell City Council, provided that such appeal is filed within a period of thirty (30) days after the review committee has made its decision. The filing of the petition shall stay the review committee's decision pending the outcome of the appeal to the city council. Any applicant aggrieved from any final decision of the city council shall have the right to appeal to the circuit court for review by filing a complaint, setting forth the alleged illegality of the action of the governing body, provided such complaint is filed within thirty (30) days after the final decision is rendered by the governing body. The filing of the said complaint shall stay the decision of the governing body pending the outcome of the appeal to the court except that the filing of such complaint shall not stay the decision of the governing body if such decision denies the right to raze or demolish a historic landmark, building or structure. The court may reverse or modify the decision of the governing body, in whole or in part, if it finds upon review that the decision of the governing body is contrary to law or that its decision is arbitrary and constitutes an abuse of discretion. The filing of an appeal hereunder shall not operate as a de facto approval of any application disapproved or denied by the review committee. 
ARTICLE X. - LIMITED COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (B-2)[11] 
Statement of intent. 
    The limited commercial district B-2 has been established along some of the major traveled streets within the City in order to protect the existing commercial establishments presently located there and to enhance these areas in order to attract similar types of establishments. Because of the unusual shallowness and/or narrowness of the lots in these areas, only certain commercial uses which will not cause an increase in traffic volumes will be allowed. To this end, the following requirements have been devised.

Such a district would permit uses which otherwise may be deemed incompatible, bit, due to the common ties to historic and architectural preservation and development, the uses coexist and work together to form a network of commercial and residential entities with a backdrop of historic significance. To the ends, development is limited to low density residential and commercial and light manufacturing (cottage industry) of historic or tourist oriented merchandise or products. 
    For clarification and better understanding of this article, the following are offered: 
    For the purpose of this article, "exterior architectural appearance: shall include architectural character; general arrangement of the exterior of a structure; general composition, including the kind, color, and texture of the building materials; and type and character of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and appurtenant elements subject to public view from a public street, public alley, or other public place."

L. - Criteria for granting a certificate of appropriateness. 
1.  Before a certificate of appropriateness is issued for the erection, reconstruction, alteration or restoration of a building or structure in the historic district, the review board shall consider: 
a.  The historical or architectural value and significance of the building or structure and its relationship to or congruity with the historic value of the land, place and area in the district upon which it is proposed to be located, constructed, reconstructed, altered, or restored. 
b.  The appropriateness of the exterior architectural features of such building or structure to such land, place or area and its relationship to or congruity with the exterior architectural features of other land, places, areas, buildings or structures in the district and environs. 
2.  Before a certificate of appropriateness is issued for the demolition of a building or structure which exists in the historic district, the review board shall consider: 
a.  Is the building of such architectural or historic interest that its removal or disturbance would be to the detriment of the public interest? 
b.  Is the building of such interest or significance that it could be made into a national, state or local historic shrine? 
c.  Is the building of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture and/or material that it could not be reproduced, or could be reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense? 
d.  Would retention of the building help preserve the historic character of the district? 
e.  Would retention of the building help preserve a historic interest in a place or an area of the city? 
f.  Would retention of the building promote the general welfare by maintaining and increasing real estate values; generating business; creating new positions; attracting tourists, students, writers, historians, artists and artisans; attracting new residents; encouraging study and interest in American history; stimulating interest and study in architecture and design; educating citizens in American culture and heritage; and making the city a more attractive and desirable place in which to live? 
3.  The review board shall not consider detailed designs, interior arrangements, or features of a building or structure which are not subject to public view from a public street, public way, or other public place, except to the extent necessary to do so for the purpose of preventing the location, construction, reconstruction, alteration or repair of a building or structure that will be incongruous with the preservation and protection of the historic aspects, settings and environment of the district and other buildings, structures, land, places of areas therein. 
M. - Issuance of certificate of appropriateness. 
    Upon approval by the review board of any erection, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or demolition, a certificate of appropriateness, signed by the zoning administrator or his/her designee and bearing the date of issuance, but subject to the provisions of this article shall be made available to the applicant. 
N. - Expiration of certificate of appropriateness. 
    Any certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to this article shall expire of its own limitations twelve (12) months from the date of issuance if the work authorized by said certificate has not commenced or if any such work is suspended or abandoned for a period of twelve (12) months after being commenced. Any certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to this article shall also expire if the work authorized by said certificate has not been substantially completed within eighteen (18) months after issuance of the certificate.

O. - Appeals from architectural review board. 
    Any applicant aggrieved by a final decision of the architectural review board shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Hopewell City Council, provided that such appeal is filed within a period of thirty (30) days after the review board has made its decision.

Any applicant aggrieved from any final decision of the city council shall have the right to appeal to the circuit court for review by filing a petition at law, setting forth the alleged illegality of the action of the governing body, provided such petition is filed within thirty (30) days after the final decision is rendered by the governing body. The filing of the said petition shall stay the decision of the governing body pending the outcome of the appeal to the court, except that the filing of such petition shall not stay the decision of the governing body if such decision denies the right to raze or demolish a historic landmark, building or structure. The court may reverse or modify the decision of the governing body, in whole or in part, if it finds upon review that the decision of the governing body is contrary to law or that its decision is arbitrary and constitutes an abuse of discretion, or it may affirm the decision of the governing body. 
P. - Violations. 
1.  Violators of the tourist/historic district section of the zoning ordinance are subject to article XX, violations and penalties. 
2.  Policy established by the architectural review board does differentiate between a minor and a major violation. 
a.  A minor violation means any action without the approval of the board which would temporarily alter a structure whose effect could be reversed at a later date such as painting, fencing, re-roofing, etc. Minor violations will be dealt with by sending the violating party a notice of violation which would include information on the tourist/historic district and the architectural review board. Repeated minor violations (i.e. more than two (2) separate instances in less than five (5) years) will be treated as a major violation. 
b.  Major violation means any act taken without approval from the board which would irreparably or permanently alter a structure or area, such as demolishing a structure, building a new structure or an addition to an existing structure, etc. Major violations will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance and include the stoppage of work orders. 
Q. - Additional or concurrent right to demolish buildings in the Historic Hopewell District. 
    In addition to the right of appeal hereinabove set forth, the owner of a building or structure, the demolition of which is subject to the provisions of this article, shall as a matter of right, be entitled to demolish such building or structure provided that: 
1.  He has applied to the board of review for such right. 
2.  That the owner has, for the period of time set forth in the time schedule hereinafter contained and a price reasonably related to its fair market value, made a bona fide offer to sell such building or structure and the land pertaining thereto to any person, government or agency thereof or political subdivision or agency thereof which gives reasonable assurance that it is willing to preserve and restore the building or structure and the land pertaining thereto. 
3.  That no bona fide contract, binding upon all parties thereto, shall have been executed for the sale of any such building or structure and the land pertaining thereto prior to the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in the time schedule hereinafter contained. Any appeal which may be taken to the court from the decision of the review board, whether instituted by the owner or by any other proper party, notwithstanding the provisions heretofore stated regarding a stay of the decision appealed from, shall not affect the right of the owner to make a bona fide offer to sell referred to in this paragraph. No offer to sell shall begin more than one (1) year after the final decision of the review board. The time schedule for offers to sell shall be as follows: 
Property Valued At: Minimum Offer to Sell Period: Less than $25,000  3 months $25,000-$39,999  4 months $40,000-$54,999  5 months $55,000-$74,999  6 months $75,000-$89,999  7 months $90,000-or more 12 months  
  
R. - Bona fide offer to sell. 
1.  Notice. Before making a bona fide offer to sell, provided for above in this article, an owner shall first file a statement with the zoning administrator. The statement shall identify the property, state the offering price, the date of the offer of sale is to begin, and the name of the real estate agent, if any. No time period set forth in the schedule contained elsewhere in section J of this article shall begin to run until the statement has been filed. Within five (5) days of receipt of a statement, copies of the statement shall be delivered to the members of city council, members of the planning commission, and the city manager. 
2.  Question as to price. The fact that an offer to sell a building or structure and the land pertaining thereto is at a price reasonably related to fair market value may be questioned; provided, it is filed with the zoning administrator, on or before fifteen (15) days after the offer for sale has begun, a petition in writing signed by at least twenty-five (25) persons owning real estate within the Historic Hopewell District. Upon receipt of such a petition, three (3) disinterested real estate appraisers, familiar with property values in the Historic Hopewell District, shall be appointed: one (1) by the review board, one (1) by the property owner and one (1) by the review board and the property owner. The cost of the appraisals shall be divided equally between the property owner and the city. Said appraisers shall forthwith make an appraisal of the building or structure and the land pertaining thereto in question and forthwith file a written report with the zoning administrator stating whether, in their opinion, the offer to sell the building or structure and the land pertaining thereto is at a price reasonably related to its fair market offer to sell the building or structure and the land pertaining thereto is at a price reasonably relate to its fair market value, the owner may continue as if no question had been raised. In the event the opinion is to the effect that the offer to sell the building or structure and the land pertaining thereto is not at a price reasonably related to its fair market value, the offer to sell shall be void an of no force and effect; and the owner, if he wishes to take advantage of the additional or concurrent right (to demolish said building or structure) provided for above in this article, must file a notice provided for above and proceed with the demolition. Notwithstanding an adverse opinion by the appraisers, if any owner has entered into a binding bona fide contract as provided for above prior to the date the appraisers have file their report with the zoning administrator, the price shall be deemed reasonably related to fair market value. 
S. - Yard variances. 
    Due to peculiar conditions of design and construction in historic neighborhoods where buildings and structures are often built close to the lot lines, it is in the public interest to retain a neighborhood's historic appearance by granting variance to normal yard requirements. Where it's deemed that such a variance will not adversely affect neighboring properties, the board of review may recommend to the board of zoning appeals that such variance to standard yard requirements be made. 
T. - Permitted uses. 
    Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent any use of land, building, or structure in the district permitted by the regulations prescribed in this ordinance for the district in which such land, buildings, or structure is otherwise located. 
U. - Exclusion. 
1.  Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior elements of any building or structure described in this article; nor shall anything in this article be construed to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any such element which the authorized municipal offers shall certify as required by public safety. 
2.  For the purpose of this ordinance; ordinary maintenance and repair is defined as any work which preserves and does not alter the present or current appearance of the exterior elements of the building or structure. 
3.  For the purpose of this section, examples of work not requiring approval of the architectural review board are: Repainting an existing window, door, porch, porch rail, etc.; re-roofing a building with the same type/color of shingles; replacing same color asbestos shingles on a house now containing asbestos shingles.

V. - Defining historic buildings and areas. 
    It shall be the continuing duty of the review board to investigate and delineate buildings, structures, places, and areas in the city having historic interest or value which should be preserved and protected in the execution and attainment of the purposes and objectives declared in this article, and to report thereon from time to time to the city council for consideration as to whether they or any of them shall be set apart for preservation and protection under the provisions of this article. 
W. - Historic markers. 
    The review board shall design an appropriate marker, bearing the seal of the city and the words "historic building" and shall invite each owner of a building of historical significance to display the marker thereon. 
X. - Protective maintenance. 
1.  All buildings and structures within the historic district shall be preserved against decay and deterioration and maintained free from structural defects to the extent that such decay, deterioration or defects may, in the opinion of the review board, result in the irreparable deterioration of any exterior appurtenance or architectural features or produce a detrimental effect upon the character of the district as a whole or upon the life and character of the structure itself. The existence of any of the following conditions shall be sufficient to deem a structure an "endangered structure":

If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in these regulations, prepare amendments to these regulations to adopt the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the governing body for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time as or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended regulations shall be provided to department of conservation and recreation (division of dam safety and floodplain management) and FEMA. 
17.  Upon the request of FEMA, complete and submit a report concerning participation in the NFIP which may request information regarding the number of buildings in the SFHA, number of permits issued for development in the SFHA, and number of variances issued for development in the SFHA. 
18.  It is the duty of the community floodplain administrator to take into account flood, mudslide and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions relating to land management and use throughout the entire jurisdictional area of the community, whether or not those hazards have been specifically delineated geographically (e.g. via mapping or surveying). 
I. - Use and interpretation of FIRMs. 
    The floodplain administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries, and floodway boundaries. The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of FIRMs and data: 
1.  Where field surveyed topography indicates that adjacent ground elevations: 
a.  Are below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of these regulations; 
b.  Are above the base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the SFHA. 
2.  In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA has not identified SFHAs, any other flood hazard data available from a federal, state, or other source shall be reviewed and reasonably used. 
3.  Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on FIRMs and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced floodway widths and/or lower base flood elevations. 
4.  Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources show increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FIRMs and in FISs. 
5.  If a preliminary flood insurance rate map and/or a preliminary flood insurance study has been provided by FEMA: 
a.  Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and shall replace the flood hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these regulations. 
b.  Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best available data pursuant to section J.3. and used where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas are provided on the effective FIRM. 
c.  Prior to issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or designated floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided by FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA. 
J. - Establishment of floodplain districts. 
1.  Basis of districts. The various floodplain districts shall include special flood hazard areas. The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the flood insurance study (FIS) and the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) for City of Hopewell prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, dated July 16, 2015, as amended. 
    The City of Hopewell may identify and regulate local flood hazard or ponding areas that are not delineated on the FIRM. These areas may be delineated on a "local flood hazard map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies. 
    The boundaries of the SFHA Districts are established as shown on the FIRM which is declared to be a part of this ordinance and which shall be kept on file at the City of Hopewell offices. 
2.  The floodway district is in an AE Zone and is delineated, for purposes of this ordinance, using the criterion that certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the one (1) percent annual chance flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. The areas included in this district are specifically defined in Table 4 of the above-referenced FIS and shown on the accompanying FIRM. 
    The following provisions shall apply within the floodway district of an AE zone [44 CFR 60.3(d)]: 
a.  Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment will not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the floodplain administrator. 
Development activities which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies - with the City of Hopewell's endorsement for a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR), and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
If section J.1. of this article is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section Q. 
b.  The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) is prohibited, except in an existing manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring, elevation, and encroachment standards are met. 
3.  The AE, or AH zones on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which one (1) percent annual chance flood elevations have been provided and the floodway has not been delineated. The following provisions shall apply within an AE or AH zone [44 CFR 60.3(c)] where FEMA has provided base flood elevations. 
    Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, designated as zones A1-30, AE, or AH on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City of Hopewell. 
    Development activities in zones Al-30, AE, or AH on the City of Hopewell FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies - with the City of Hopewell's endorsement for a conditional letter of map revision, and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
4.  The A zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but the one percent annual chance floodplain boundary has been approximated. For these areas, the following provisions shall apply [44 CFR 60.3(b)]: 
    The approximated floodplain district shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a one (1) percent annual chance floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown as zone A on the maps accompanying the FIS. For these areas, the base flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used, when available. Where the specific one (1) percent annual chance flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U. S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this base flood elevation. For development proposed in the approximate floodplain the applicant must use technical methods that correctly reflect currently accepted practices, such as point on boundary, high water marks, or detailed methodologies hydrologic and hydraulic analyses. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the department of development and city engineer. 
    The floodplain administrator reserves the right to require a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for any development. When such base flood elevation data is utilized, the lowest floor shall be elevated to or above the base flood level plus eighteen (18) inches. 
    During the permitting process, the floodplain administrator shall obtain: 
a.  The elevation of the lowest floor (in relation to mean sea level), including the basement, of all new and substantially improved structures; and 
b.  If the structure has been flood-proofed in accordance with the requirements of this article, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been flood-proofed. 
    Base flood elevation data shall be obtained from other sources or developed using detailed methodologies comparable to those contained in a FIS for subdivision proposals and other proposed development proposals (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that exceed fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser. 
5.  The AO zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas of shallow flooding identified as AO on the FIRM. For these areas, the following provisions shall apply [44 CFR 60.3(c)]: 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM, above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall: 
1)  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM, above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade; or, 
2)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood-proofed to the specified flood level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
c.  Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be provided to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
6.  The coastal A zone is labeled as AE on the FIRM; it is those areas that are seaward of the limit of moderate wave action (LiMWA) line. As defined by the VA USBC, these areas are subject to wave heights between 1.5 feet and three (3) feet. For these areas, the following provisions shall apply: 
    Buildings and structures within this zone shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood elevation plus one (1) foot of freeboard, and must comply with the provisions in section J of this article. 
7.  The VE or V zones on FIRMs accompanying the FIS shall be those areas that are known as coastal high hazard areas, extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast or other areas subject to high velocity waves. For these areas, the following provisions shall apply [44 CFR 60.3(e)]: 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements in zones V and VE, including manufactured homes, shall be elevated on pilings or columns so that: 
(1)  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level plus eighteen (18) inches. If the lowest horizontal structural member is parallel to the direction of wave approach or elevated at least two (2) feet above the base flood level if the lowest horizontal structural member is perpendicular to the direction of wave approach; and, 
(2)  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (one (1) percent annual chance). 
b.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of section J. 
c.  The floodplain administrator shall obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in zones V and VE. The floodplain management administrator shall maintain a record of all such information. 
d.  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
e.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood-lattice work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
1)  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
2)  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
f.  The enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be partitioned into multiple rooms, temperature-controlled, or used for human habitation. The enclosed space shall be less than two hundred ninety-nine (299) square feet. 
g.  The use of fill for structural support of buildings is prohibited. When non-structural fill is proposed in a coastal high hazard area, appropriate engineering analyses shall be conducted to evaluate the impacts of the fill prior to issuance of a development permit. 
h.  The man-made alteration of sand dunes, which would increase potential flood damage, is prohibited. 
8.  The mapped floodplain includes all of the above regions and also the regions designated as having a 0.2 percent annual chance of flooding on any flood map or flood insurance study. In this area no emergency service, medical service or governmental records storage shall be allowed except by special exception using the variance process. 
K. - Official zoning map. 
    The boundaries of the special flood hazard area and floodplain districts are established as shown on the flood insurance rate map which is declared to be a part of this ordinance and which shall be kept on file at the City of Hopewell offices. 
L. - Jurisdictional boundary changes. 
    The county floodplain ordinance in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. Municipalities with existing floodplain ordinances shall pass a resolution acknowledging and accepting responsibility for enforcing floodplain ordinance standards prior to annexation of any area containing identified flood hazards. If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in these regulations, prepare amendments to these regulations to adopt the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the governing body for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time as or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended regulations shall be provided to department of conservation and recreation (division of dam safety and floodplain management) and FEMA. 
    In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, title 44 subpart (B) section 59.22(a)(9)(v) all NFIP participating communities must notify the Federal Insurance Administration and optionally the state coordinating office in writing whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by annexation or the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. 
    In order that all flood insurance rate maps accurately represent the community's boundaries, a copy of a map of the community suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority must be included with the notification. 
M. - District boundary changes. 
    The delineation of any of the floodplain districts may be revised by the City of Hopewell where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual documents the need for such change. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from Federal Emergency Management Agency. A completed LOMR is record of this approval. 
N. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
    Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be made by the zoning officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the districts, the board of zoning appeals shall make the necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. 
O. - Submitting model backed technical data. 
    A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify the federal insurance administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data. 
P. - Letters of map revision. 
    When development in the floodplain will cause or causes a change in the base flood elevation, the applicant, including state agencies, must notify FEMA by applying for a conditional letter of map revision and then a letter of map revision. 
    For example: 
  Any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway. 
  Any development occurring in zones A1-30 and AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than one (1) foot in the base flood elevation. 
  Alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges) 44 Code of Federal Regulations § 65.3 and § 65.6(a)(12). 
Q. - District provisions.

(c)  Meet all the requirements for manufactured homes in section Q.3.d. 
4.  Standards for approximated floodplain. The following provisions shall apply with the approximate floodplain district: 
    The Approximated Floodplain District shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a one hundred-year floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown as zone A on the maps accompanying the flood insurance study. For these areas, the one hundred-year flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used, when available. Where the specific one hundred-year flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U. S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the department of development and city engineer. 
    When such base flood elevation data is utilized, the lowest floor shall be two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. During the permitting process, the applicant shall obtain and submit information proving:

1.  The showing of good and sufficient cause. 
2.  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments. No variance shall be granted for any proposed use, development, or activity within any floodway district that will cause any increase in the one hundred-year flood elevation. 
3.  The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others. 
4.  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions. 
5.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners. 
6.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
7.  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. 
8.  The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 
9.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
10.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 
11.  The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood. 
12.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site. 
13.  The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
14.  Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this ordinance. 
    The board of zoning appeals may refer any application and accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities, and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters. 
    Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such will not result in: (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
    Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the variance will be the minimum required to provide relief. 
    The board of zoning appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance, in writing, that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the one hundred-year flood elevation: (a) increases the risks to life and property and (b) will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. 
    A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all variance actions, including justification for the issuance of the variances. Any variances that are issued shall be noted in the annual or biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administrator.

a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
b.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
c.  Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places must be obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or the state historic preservation officer. Any exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
46.  Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

ARTICLE XV-A. - CHESAPEAKE BAY PRESERVATION AREA OVERLAY DISTRICT 

A. - Title. 
    This article may be known and referenced as the "Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay District" of the City of Hopewell and also referred to herein as the "overlay district." 
B. - Findings of fact. 
    The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries are one (1) of the most important and productive estuarine systems in the world, providing economic and social benefits to the citizens of City of Hopewell and the Commonwealth of Virginia. The health of the Bay is vital to maintaining Hopewell's economy and the welfare of its citizens. 
    The Chesapeake Bay waters have been degraded significantly by many sources of pollution, including nonpoint source pollution from land uses and development. Existing high quality waters are worthy of protection from degradation to guard against further pollution. Certain lands that are proximate to the shoreline have intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological and biological processes they perform. Other lands have severe development constraints from flooding, erosion, and soil limitations Protected from disturbance; they offer significant ecological benefits by providing water quality maintenance and pollution control as well as flood and shoreline erosion control. These lands together, designated by the City Council as Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas (hereinafter "CBPAs", or more specifically RPAs or RMAs), need to be protected from destruction and damage in order to protect the quality of water in the Bay and consequently the quality of life in the City of Hopewell and the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
C. - Purpose and intent.

Land development in resource protection areas may be allowed only when permitted by the director of development and if it: (i) is water-dependent; (ii) constitutes redevelopment; (iii) constitutes development or redevelopment within a designated intensely developed area; (iv) is a new use subject to the provisions of section K.3.b.(2) of this article; (v) is a road or driveway crossing satisfying the conditions set forth in section G.1.c. below or (vi) is a flood control or stormwater management facility as noted in Water Q. 
a.  A new or expanded water dependent facility may be allowed provided that the following criteria are met: 
(1)  It does not conflict with the comprehensive plan; 
(2)  It complies with the performance criteria set forth in section K of this article; 
(3)  Any non-water-dependent component is located outside of the RPA; and 
(4)  Access to the water-dependent facility will be provided with the minimum disturbance necessary. Where practicable, a single point of access will be provided. 
b.  Redevelopment on isolated redevelopment sites outside of locally designated intensely developed areas sites shall be permitted only if there is no increase in the amount of impervious cover and no further encroachment within the RPA and it shall conform to the stormwater management requirements outlined under section K.2.h. and the erosion and sediment control requirements outlined under section K.2.d. of this article. 
c.  Roads and driveways not exempt under section O and which, therefore, must comply with the provisions of this article, may be constructed in or across RPAs if each of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The director of development makes a finding that there are no reasonable alternatives to aligning the road or drive in or across the RPA; 
(2)  The alignment and design of the road or driveway are optimized, consistent with other applicable requirements, to minimize encroachment in the RPA and minimize adverse effects on water quality; 
(3)  The design and construction of the road or driveway satisfy all applicable criteria of this article; 
(4)  The director of development reviews the plan for the road or driveway proposed in or across the RPA in coordination with the plan of development requirements as required under section M or subdivision plan. 
d.  Flood control and stormwater management facilities that drain or treat water from multiple developments projects or from a significant portion of a watershed may be allowed in the RPA provided that the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The City of Hopewell has conclusively established that the location of the facility within the RPA is the optimum location; 
(2)  The size of the facility is the minimum necessary to provide necessary flood control, stormwater management, or both;

(4)  All applicable permits for construction have been obtained from the appropriate state and federal agencies; 
(5)  The City of Hopewell has approved the project prior to construction; and 
(6)  Routine maintenance will be performed to assure that these facilities continue to perform as designed. 
2.  A water quality impact assessment as outlined in section L, water quality impact assessment of this article shall be required for any proposed land disturbance, development or redevelopment within resource protection areas (RPAs) and for any other development within resource management areas (RMAs) when required by the director of development due to the unique characteristics of the site or intensity of development, in accordance with the provisions of section L, water quality impact assessment, of this article. 
H. - Lot size. 
    Lot size shall be subject to the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s), provided that any lot shall have sufficient area outside the resource protection area (RPA) to accommodate an intended development, in accordance with the performance standards in section K, performance standards, when such development is not otherwise allowed in the resource protection area (RPA). 
I. - Conflict with other regulations. 
    In any case where the requirements of this article conflict with any other provision of the City of Hopewell Code or existing state and federal regulations, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall apply. 
J. - Interpretation of resource protection area boundaries. 
1.  Delineation by the applicant. The site-specific boundaries of the resource protection area shall be determined by the applicant through the performance of an environmental site assessment, subject to approval by the director of development and in accordance with section M, plan of development process, of this article, or section L, water quality impact assessment, of this article. The official zoning map, or an overlay thereto showing the approximate RPA and RMA boundaries, may be used as a guide to the general location of resource protection areas. 
2.  Delineation by the City of Hopewell. The director of development, when requested by the applicant wishing to construct a single-family residence, may waive the requirement for an environmental site assessment and perform the delineation. The director of development may use hydrology, soils, plant species, and other data, and consult with other appropriate resources as needed to perform the delineation. 
3.  Where conflict arises over delineation. Where the applicant has provided a site-specific delineation of the resource protection area (RPA), the director of development shall verify the accuracy of the boundary delineation. In determining the site-specific RPA boundary, the director of development may render adjustments to the applicant's boundary delineation, in accordance with section M, plan of development process, of this article. In the event the adjusted boundary delineation is contested by the applicant, the applicant may seek relief, in accordance with the provisions of section M.8., denial of plan, appeal of conditions or modifications. 
K. - Performance standards. 
1.  Purpose and intent. The performance standards establish the means to minimize erosion and sedimentation potential, reduce land application of nutrients and toxics, and maximize rainwater infiltration. Natural ground cover, especially woody vegetation, is most effective in holding soil in place and preventing site erosion. Indigenous vegetation, with its adaptability to local conditions without the use of harmful fertilizers or pesticides, filters stormwater runoff. Keeping impervious cover to a minimum enhances rainwater infiltration and effectively reduces stormwater runoff potential. 
    The purpose and intent of these requirements is also to implement the following objectives: Prevent a net increase in nonpoint source pollution from new development; achieve a ten (10) percent reduction in nonpoint source pollution from redevelopment; and achieve a forty (40) percent reduction in nonpoint source pollution from agricultural uses. 
2.  General performance standards for development and redevelopment. 
a.  Land disturbance shall be limited to the area necessary to provide for the proposed use or development. 
(1)  In accordance with an approved site plan, the limits of clearing or grading shall be strictly defined by the construction footprint. The director of development shall review and approve the construction footprint through the plan of development process. These limits shall be clearly shown on submitted plans and physically marked in the development site. 
(2)  The construction footprint shall not exceed the limits for such as designated by the zoning district of the lot or parcel. 
(3)  Ingress and egress during construction shall be limited to one (1) access point, unless otherwise approved by the director of development. 
b.  Indigenous vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the proposed use or development permitted and in accordance with the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook. 
(1)  Existing trees over two (2) inches in diameter at breast height (DBH) shall be preserved outside the approved construction footprint. Diseased trees or trees weakened by age, storm, fire, or other injury may be removed, when approved by the director of development. Other woody vegetation on site shall also be preserved outside the approved construction footprint. 
(2)  Site clearing for construction activities shall be allowed as approved by the director of development through the plan of development review process outlined under section M, plan of development process, of this article. 
(3)  Prior to clearing, grading and/or filling suitable protective barriers, like safety fencing, shall be erected five (5) feet outside the dripline of any tree or stand of trees to be preserved. Erected protective barriers shall remain so erected throughout all phases of construction. The storage of equipment, materials, debris, or fill shall not be allowed within the area protected by the barrier. 
c.  Land development shall minimize impervious cover consistent with the proposed use or development. 
(1)  Grid and modular pavement shall be used for any required parking area, alley, or other low traffic driveway, unless otherwise approved by the director of development. 
(2)  Parking space size shall be one hundred sixty-two (162) square feet. Parking space width shall be nine (9) feet; parking space length shall be eighteen (18) feet. Two-way drives shall be a minimum of twenty-two (22) feet. 
(3)  Impervious coverage on any lot or parcel shall be limited to the lot coverage permitted under the zoning district requirements of said lot or parcel as noted on the approved plan of development [site plan, plot plan, other approved plan]. 
d.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article or exceptions or exemptions thereto, any land disturbing activity exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet, including construction of all single-family houses, shall comply with the requirements of City of Hopewell Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance. 
e.  All development and redevelopment within RMAs and RPAs that exceeds two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of land disturbance shall be subject to a plan of development process, including the approval of a site plan in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance; or a subdivision plan in accordance with the subdivision ordinance; or a water quality impact assessment in accordance with section L, water quality impact assessment of this article. 
f.  All on-site sewage disposal systems not requiring a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) permit shall be pumped out at least once every five (5) years, in accordance with the provisions of City of Hopewell Health Code. 
g.  For new construction, a reserve sewage disposal site with a capacity at least equal to that of the primary sewage disposal site shall be provided, in accordance with the City of Hopewell Health Code. This requirement shall not apply to any lot or parcel recorded prior to October 1, 1989 and such lot or parcel is not sufficient in capacity to accommodate a reserve sewage disposal site, as determined by the local health department. Building or the construction of any impervious surface shall be prohibited on the area of all sewage disposal sites or on an on-site sewage treatment system which operates under a permit issued by the state water control board, until the structure is served by public sewer. 
h.  For any use or development, stormwater runoff shall be controlled by the use of best management practices consistent with the water quality protection provisions of the Virginia Stormwater Management Regulations (4 VAC 3-20-10 et seq.). 
(1)  For development, the post-development nonpoint source pollution runoff load shall not exceed the pre-development load, based on the calculated average land cover condition for Tidewater, which has been established as the amount of runoff that produces 0.45 pounds of phosphate per acre per year; 
(2)  For sites within intensively developed areas (IDAs) or other isolated redevelopment sites, the nonpoint source pollution load shall be reduced by at least ten (10) percent. The director of development may waive or modify this requirement for redevelopment sites that originally incorporated best management practices for stormwater runoff quality control, provided the following provisions are satisfied: 
(a)  In no case may the post-development nonpoint source pollution runoff load exceed the pre-development load; 
(b)  Runoff pollution loads must have been calculated and the BMPs selected for the expressed purpose of controlling nonpoint source pollution; and 
(c)  Where structural best management practices are already in place, evidence shall be provided that facilities are currently in good working order and performing at the design levels of service. The director of development may require a review of both the original structure's design and maintenance plan to verify this provision. A new maintenance agreement may be required to ensure compliance with this article. 
i.  Prior to initiating grading or other on-site activities on any portion of a lot or parcel, all wetlands permits required by federal, state, and local laws and regulations shall be obtained and evidence of such submitted to the director of development, in accordance with section M, plan of development process, of this article. 
3.  Buffer area requirements. To minimize the adverse effects of human activities on the other components of resource protection areas, state waters, and aquatic life, a one hundred-foot wide buffer area of vegetation that is effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff shall be retained if present and established where it does not exist. 
    The buffer area shall be located adjacent to and landward of other RPA components and along both sides of any water body with perennial flow. The one hundred-foot full buffer area shall be designated as the landward component of the resource protection area, in accordance with sections E, areas of applicability and section M, plan of development process, of this article. Notwithstanding permitted uses, encroachments, and vegetation clearing, as set forth in section G, and this section, the one hundred-foot buffer area is not reduced in width. 
    The one hundred-foot buffer area shall be deemed to achieve a seventy-five (75) percent reduction of sediments and a forty (40) percent reduction of nutrients. 
a.  Permitted modifications to the buffer area. 
(1)  In order to maintain the functional value of the buffer area, indigenous vegetation may be removed only, subject to approval by the director of development, to provide for reasonable sight lines, access paths, general woodlot management, and best management practices, including those that prevent upland erosion and concentrated flows of stormwater, as follows: 
(a)  Trees may be pruned or removed as necessary to provide for sight lines and vistas, provided that where removed, they shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff; 
(b)  Any path shall be constructed and surfaced so as to effectively control erosion; 
(c)  Dead, diseased, or dying trees or shrubbery and noxious weeds (such as Johnson grass, kudzu and multiflora rose) may be removed and thinning of trees allowed as permitted by the director of development pursuant to sound horticultural practices; and 
(d)  For shoreline erosion control projects, trees and woody vegetation may be removed, necessary control techniques employed, and appropriate vegetation established to protect or stabilize the shoreline in accordance with the best available technical advice and applicable permit conditions or requirements. 
b.  Permitted encroachments into the buffer area. 
(1)  When the application of the buffer area would result in the loss of a buildable area on a lot or parcel recorded prior to October 1, 1989, the director of development may, through an administrative process, permit encroachments into the buffer area in accordance with section M, plan of development process of this article, and the following criteria: 
(a)  Encroachments into the buffer area shall be the minimum necessary to achieve a reasonable buildable area for a principal structure and necessary utilities; 
(b)  Where practicable, a vegetated area that will maximize water quality protection, mitigate the effects of the buffer encroachment, and is equal to the area of encroachment into the buffer area shall be established elsewhere on the lot or parcel; and 
(c)  The encroachment may not extend into the seaward fifty (50) feet of the buffer area. 
(2)  When the application of the buffer area would result in the loss of a buildable area on a lot or parcel recorded between October 1, 1989 and March 1, 2002, the director of development may permit encroachments into the buffer area in accordance with section M, plan of development process and the following criteria: 
(a)  The lot or parcel was created as a result of a legal process conducted in conformity with the city's subdivision regulations; 
(b)  Conditions or mitigation measures imposed through a previously approved exception shall be met; 
(c)  If the use of a best management practice (BMP) was previously required, the BMP shall be evaluated to determine if it continues to function effectively and, if necessary, the BMP shall be reestablished or repaired and maintained as required; and 
(d)  The criteria in subsection (1) above shall be met. 
L. - Water quality impact assessment. 
1.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of the water quality impact assessment is to: (i) identify the impacts of proposed land disturbance, development or redevelopment on water quality and lands in RPAs and other environmentally sensitive lands; (ii) ensure that, where land disturbance, development or redevelopment does take place within RPAs and other sensitive lands, it will occur on those portions of a site and in a manner that will be least disruptive to the natural functions of RPAs and other sensitive lands; (iii) to protect individuals from investing funds for improvements proposed for location on lands unsuited for such development because of high ground water, erosion, or vulnerability to flood and storm damage; (iv) provide for administrative relief from terms of this article when warranted and in accordance with the requirements contained herein; and (v) specify mitigation which will address water quality protection.

A water quality impact assessment shall be required (i) for any proposed land disturbance, development or redevelopment activity within a resource protection area (RPA) as permitted consistent with section G.1. of this article; (ii) any buffer encroachment as provided for in section K.3.b. of this article; (iii) for any other development in resource management areas (RMAs) as deemed necessary by the director of development due to the unique site characteristics or intensity of the proposed use or development. There shall be two (2) levels of water quality impact assessments: a minor assessment and a major assessment. 
3.  Minor water quality impact assessment. A minor water quality impact assessment pertains only to land disturbance, development or redevelopment activity within a CBPA which causes no more than five thousand (5,000) square feet of land disturbance and/or which proposes to encroach into the landward fifty (50) feet of the one hundred-foot buffer area as permitted under section K.3.b. of this article. A minor assessment must demonstrate that the undisturbed buffer area, enhanced vegetative plantings and any required best management practices will result in the removal of no less than seventy-five (75) percent of sediments and forty (40) percent of nutrients from post-development stormwater runoff and that will retard runoff, prevent erosion, and filter nonpoint source pollution the equivalent of the full undisturbed one hundred-foot buffer area. A minor assessment shall include a site drawing to scale which shows the following: 
a.  Location of the components of the resource protection area, including the one hundred-foot buffer area and the location of any water body with perennial flow; 
b.  Location and nature of the proposed encroachment into the buffer area, including: Type of paving material; areas of clearing or grading; location of any structures, drives, or other impervious cover; and sewage disposal systems or reserve drainfield sites;

    Where, at the time of passage of this ordinance or any amendments thereto, lawful use of land and/or structures exist which would not be permitted by this ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
1.  No such nonconforming use and/or structure shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance unless said enlargement does not result in an increase in nonconformity or results in a change to a use permitted in this district; however, in [the] B-4 district, any single-family, detached dwelling may be enlarged, provided all setbacks are observed. 
2.  No such nonconforming use and/or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use and/or structure at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance unless said move results in decreasing the degree of nonconformity or results in conformity with the requirements for the district. 
3.  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. No additional uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved shall be permitted. 
4.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land, outside such building. 
5.  When any nonconforming use is superceded by a permitted use, the use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and no nonconforming use shall thereafter be resumed. 
6.  If any such nonconforming use of land and/or structure ceases for a period of more than two (2) years (except when government action impedes access to the premises), any subsequent use of such land and/or structure shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located. 
7.  If any change in title of possession, or renewal of a lease of any such lot or structure occurs, the existing use may continue. 
B. - Permits. 
1.  All nonconforming uses shall be issued a certificate of occupancy within twelve (12) months from the adoption of this ordinance. 
2.  The construction or use of a nonconforming building or land area for which a building permit was issued legally prior to the adoption of this ordinance may proceed, provided such building is completed within one (1) year, or such use of land established within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this ordinance. However, the time period may be extended by the governing body, upon recommendation by the planning commission. 
C. - Repairs, maintenance, and expansion. 
1.  On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done for any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixture wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structures or nonconforming portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the cubic content, existing when it became nonconforming, shall not be increased. 
2.  If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure thereof, containing a nonconforming use, becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, rebuilt, or used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
3.  No change or expansion of a structure containing a nonconforming use shall be allowed with the exception that: 
a.  The city council may grant a conditional use permit for alterations or additions to such structures provided that the alteration or expansion to the structure containing a nonconforming use does not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the gross floor area of the existing structure. 
b.  An application for a conditional use permit shall be made to and upon forms furnished by the director of development and shall include the minimum information required by article XVIII-G.3. of the zoning ordinance for a conditional use permit. 
c.  A conditional use permit for the expansion of a structure containing a nonconforming use shall become null and void twelve (12) months from the date granted if no substantial work has commenced. 
D. - Changes in district boundaries. 
1.  Whenever the boundaries of a district are changed, any uses of land or buildings which become nonconforming as a result of such change shall become subject to the provisions of this article. 
E. - Restoration or replacement. 
1.  If a nonconforming structure or a conforming structure devoted to a nonconforming activity is destroyed or damaged in any manner, to the extent that the cost of restoration to its condition before the occurrence shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the cost of reconstructing the entire structure based on the assessed value, as recorded in the city real estate assessment office, it may be repaired or restored, provided any such repair or restoration is started within six (6) months and completed within twelve (12) months from the date of partial destruction. 
2.  If the cost of restoration to its condition before the occurrence shall exceed fifty (50) percent of the cost, based on the assessed value as recorded in the city real estate assessment office, of reconstructing the entire structure, it may be repaired or restored only upon the issuance of a special use permit by the administrator with the approval of the board of zoning appeals. 
3.  In approving such permit, the board shall consider the stated purpose for establishing the zoning district, in which the structure is located, the uses in the area immediately surrounding the structure in question, particularly the other nonconforming uses, and the hardship which would result from a denial of the special use permit. The permit shall include conditions as to the time within which the repair or restoration must be started and completed and may contain any other conditions regarding the repair and restoration which, in the opinion of the board, shall be necessary to carry out the intent of this section and the ordinance. 
4.  The cost of land or any factors other than the cost of the structure are excluded in the determination of fair market value for the purpose of calculating the percent of damage. 
5.  Where nonconforming status applies to a use and/or structure removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost, based on the assessed value as recorded in the city real estate assessment office, at the time of destruction. 
F. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
1.  In any district, permitted structures may be erected on any nonconforming lot of record; provided that said lot is in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership which could be combined with said nonconforming lot to provide one (1) or more lots which would comply with applicable set back and yard requirements. 
2.  In any district, existing permitted structures may be enlarged on any nonconforming lot of record; provided that it is in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership, and provided that the setback and yard requirements are met. 
G. - Highway realignment or condemnation. 
    Any lot, which, by reason of realignment of a public street or highway or by reason of condemnation proceedings, has been reduced in size to an area less than that required by law, shall be considered a nonconforming lot of record subject to the provisions set forth in this section; and any lawful use or structure existing at the time of such highway realignment or condemnation proceedings which would thereafter no longer be permitted under the terms of this ordinance shall be considered a nonconforming use or structure as that term is used in this ordinance. 
ARTICLE XVIII. - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
    The requirements set forth in this article shall apply to all real estate development within the city. In addition to these standards, additional standards shall apply to residential, office, business, and industrial developments, as well as signs, and access and internal circulation and other aspects of development as provided in this article and elsewhere in the zoning ordinance. 

A. - General provisions-Citywide. 
1.  Building permit. Before any building permit for any building, structure, reconstruction, enlargement or alteration shall be issued, the zoning classification for the building site shall be verified, and the proposed building, structure, reconstruction, enlargement or alteration shall comply with all applicable requirements of the zoning district in which it is located and this ordinance. 
2.  Certificate of occupancy. 
a.  Written application for a certificate of occupancy for a building shall be made at the same time as the application for the building permit for such building, and a written request for issuance of the same shall be made to the director of development after the completion of the work covered by the building permit. If the proposed use is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, and of all other applicable laws and ordinances, as certified to the director of development by the officers, bodies or agencies responsible for the administration thereof, the certificate of occupancy shall be issued within five (5) working days after the request for the issuance of the same has been made. Pending the issuance of such a certificate, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a period not exceeding three (3) months during the completion of any alterations that are required under the provisions of any law or ordinance. Such temporary certificate shall not be construed as in any way altering the respective rights, duties or obligations of the owner or of the city relating to the use or occupancy of the land or building or any other matter covered by this ordinance. The city may require the applicant to post a surety on the value associated with uncompleted work when a temporary certificate is issued. 
b.  Written application for a certificate of occupancy for the use of vacant land or for a change in the use of land or a building, for a change of a nonconforming use, or for the enlargement of a use for the continuation of a use as provided in section B of this article shall be made to the director of development. If the proposed use is in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, and of all other applicable laws and ordinances, as certified to the director of development by the officers, bodies or agencies responsible for the administration thereof, the certificate of occupancy shall be issued within five (5) working days after the application for the same has been made. 
c.  A certificate of occupancy shall be obtained from the director of development for any of the following: 
(1)  Change in the use of an existing building. 
(2)  Occupancy and use of vacant land, except for any agricultural use. 
(3)  Change in the use of land, except for any agricultural use. 
(4)  Any change in the use of a nonconforming activity, structure or parcel. 
(5)  Enlargement of any use, with respect to the unit of measurement specified in this chapter as the basis for determining the amount of required automobile parking space, whether the same is specified in terms of floor area, dwelling units, seats, or any other element of size of the use. 
d.  No occupancy, use or change or enlargement of use of any land or building shall take place until a certificate of occupancy therefore has been issued by the director of development except as otherwise provided for in this section A.2. 
e.  No certificate of occupancy shall be deemed to validate any violation of any provision of any law or ordinance or to waive or stop enforcement thereof. 
f.  A certificate of occupancy shall be deemed to authorize, and is required for, both initial and continued occupancy and use of the building or land to which it applies and shall continue in effect so long as such building and the use thereof or of such land is in full conformity with the provisions of this ordinance and any requirements made pursuant thereto. Upon a determination of any violation of any of such provisions or requirements with respect to any building, or the use thereof or of land, the certificate of occupancy for such use shall thereupon become null and void and a new certificate shall be required for any further use of such building or land. 
g.  On written request by the owner, the director of development shall issue a certificate of occupancy for any use of a building or land existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance or at the time of the adoption of any amendments of this ordinance changing the regulations applying to such building or land, certifying, after inspection and investigation, the extent and kind of such use and whether the same (i) conforms to the provisions of this chapter for the district in which it is situated or (ii) is a nonconforming use. The director of development may require such proof as may be necessary to enable him to make a determination in the matter, and the furnishings of such proof shall be a condition of his acting on the request. 
3.  Protection of visual resources. Development shall be designed to protect visual resources identified in the comprehensive plan against encroachment, degradation or destruction to the maximum extent practicable. 
4.  Utility lines. All utility lines such as electric, telephone, CATV or other similar lines shall be installed underground. Where transmission lines already traverse a property proposed for subdivision but do not serve such property, the subdivider shall not be required to place such lines underground. This paragraph shall apply to lines serving individual residential, office, commercial and industrial sites as well as to utility lines necessary within projects. 
5.  Solid waste storage areas. 
a.  With the exception of garbage can and recycling container areas that serve single- or two-family dwellings, solid waste storage areas, including without limitation the storage area itself and all garbage cans, mobile toters, trash compactors, recycling containers, etc., shall be screened from view of adjacent property and public rights-of-way by a masonry or concrete wall that is constructed of comparable materials to and designed to be compatible with the principal building that the solid waste storage area serves, except that solid waste storage areas in manufacturing districts need not be screened from view of any manufacturing district or from any public right-of-way that does not accommodate or is not intended to accommodate through traffic movements. 
b.  All solid waste storage areas shall observe the parking setbacks of the districts in which they are located. 
c.  Solid waste storage areas (excluding garbage can and recycling container areas serving single- or two-family dwellings) located within one thousand (1,000) feet of any residential district shall not be serviced between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Such areas shall be prominently posted with a sign not to exceed six (6) square feet designating the hours in which the solid waste storage area may be serviced. 
6.  Architectural treatment. 
a.  Prior to the approval of any site plan for a project, the applicant shall submit for approval documents that define the overall architectural theme of the project. The architectural theme is a written and/or graphic description of the planned architectural treatment of all buildings within a project. The theme shall describe how exterior materials, colors, architectural style and building scale shall be employed to establish a consistent architectural treatment for the project. Architectural treatment of buildings, including materials, color and style, shall be consistent throughout the project and compatible with other buildings located within the same project. Consistency and compatibility may be achieved through the use of similar building massing, materials, scale, colors and other architectural features. 
b.  All junction and accessory boxes except those in manufacturing districts and those not visible outside the project shall be minimized from view of adjacent property and public rights-of-way by landscaping or architectural treatment integrated with the building served. In manufacturing districts, junction and accessory boxes need not be minimized from view of adjacent property within the manufacturing district or from any public right-of-way which does not accommodate or is not intended to accommodate through traffic movements. 
c.  Mechanical equipment, whether ground-level or rooftop, shall be screened from view of adjacent property and public rights-of-way and designed to be perceived as an integral part of the building, except as stated herein. In manufacturing districts, mechanical equipment need not be screened from view of adjacent property within the manufacturing district or from any public right-of-way which does not accommodate or is not intended to accommodate through traffic movements. 
d.  No building exterior (whether front, side or rear) shall consist of architectural materials inferior in quality, appearance or detail to any other exterior of the same building. Nothing in this section shall preclude the use of different materials on different exteriors that are representative of good architectural design but rather, shall preclude the use of inferior materials on sides which face adjoining property and thus, might adversely impact existing or future development resulting in the depreciation of property values. No portion of a building constructed of cinder block or corrugated and/or sheet metal that is not completely covered with an acceptable façade shall be visible from any adjoining residential and business districts or any public right-of-way. Further, buildings shall be designed with harmonious proportions and shall not have monotonous facades or large bulky masses. Buildings shall possess architectural variety but shall be compatible with existing structures, especially nearby structures of historic interest. New or remodeled buildings shall be consistent with the overall cohesive character of the area in which they are situated as reflected in existing structures. This character shall be achieved through the use of design elements, including, but not limited to, materials, balconies and/or terraces, articulation of doors and windows, sculptural or textural relief of facades, architectural ornamentation, varied roof lines or other appurtenances such as lighting fixtures and/or landscaping, all as may be more particularly described in any applicable adopted plans and guidelines. 
7.  Fencing. 
a.  Fence permits. 
(1)  A fence permit shall be required before a fence is erected, relocated or repaired, if said repair involves ten (10) percent or more of the length of the fence. Fence permits may be acquired by the property owner, tenant, or the contractor erecting or repairing the fence with an acknowledgement from the owner. All fences installed subsequent to the enactment of this subsection 7. shall comply with the requirements of this ordinance; if a fence does not so comply, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to bring the fence into compliance. 
(2)  There shall be a fee for a fence permit. Each application for such permit shall be accompanied by plans or drawings clearly showing the size, type of materials to be used and the exact location of the proposed fence. Plans and drawings may be made by the applicant unless the director of development determines that the safe construction of the fence will require engineering drawings. 
(3)  All fences existing on the date of this ordinance, including fences not in compliance, are exempt from this subsection 7. However, any subsequent modification or repair of a fence previously complying or exempt as a non-complying pre-existing use, that either expands the area enclosed, or involves more than ten (10) percent of the length of the fence, shall require a fence permit. 
b.  Permitted fences. 
(1)  Residential zoning districts. Fences up to seven (7) feet high shall be permitted along all property lines, subject to the necessary setbacks, for property zoned residential or residential-office or used for single-family residences, except: 
i.  No fence higher than four (4) feet shall be permitted in any front or corner side yard between the street line and the front or side building line of the subject property and any adjacent property; provided, however, that city council may grant a conditional use permit for a fence not to exceed seven (7) feet in height in these areas. 
ii.  No fence blocking or impeding the unobstructed view of vehicular traffic shall be permitted within twenty (20) feet of the point of intersection of two (2) public street rights-of-way; if at a later date streets are expanded and existing fences block or impede the unobstructed view of vehicular traffic, such fences shall be deemed to be a violation of the ordinance and shall be removed. 
(2)  Business zoning districts. 
i.  Fences up to eight (8) feet in height shall be permitted along all property lines for property zoned business, except that no fence blocking or impeding the unobstructed view of vehicular traffic shall be allowed within twenty (20) feet of the point of intersection of two public street rights-of-way; if at a later date streets are expanded and existing fences block or impede the unobstructed view of vehicular traffic, such fences shall be deemed to be a violation of the ordinance and shall be removed. 
ii.  Fences erected in business zoning districts shall be constructed of materials compatible with those used to construct the main structure(s) on the property, unless otherwise permitted under this ordinance. 
(3)  Industrial zoning districts. 
i.  Fences up to ten (10) feet in height shall be permitted along all property lines for property zoned industrial, except that no fence blocking or impeding the unobstructed view of vehicular traffic shall be permitted within twenty (20) feet of the point of intersection of two public street rights-of-way; if at a later date streets are expanded and existing fences block or impede the unobstructed view of vehicular traffic, such fences shall be deemed to be a violation of the ordinance and shall be removed. 
ii.  Barbed wire strands not to exceed three (3) strands on top of complying fencing and within the height limits established in subsection 7.b.(3)i. above shall be allowed in industrial districts. Barbed wire is not permitted in any other district. 
(4)  Prohibited fencing and fencing materials. The following fencing and fencing materials are prohibited in all districts: 
i.  Razor wire, except at public penal facilities; 
ii.  Above-ground electrical fencing; and 
iii.  Concertina wire. 
8.  Retaining walls. 
a.  Retaining walls shall be constructed so that they are compatible and consistent in appearance with the principal structures in the development and/or the view shed in which they are located. Compatibility and consistency shall be accomplished through the use of integrated color block or other material that is similar in appearance to the primary structures or is an earth tone acceptable to the director of development. 
b.  Walls over ten (10) feet in height and within fifty (50) feet of, and facing, an exterior property line or public right-of-way shall employ landscaping along the wall base to soften the visual impact of the wall. Landscaping shall consist of any required setback planting as well as additional evergreen trees to break up large expanses of wall. 
c.  Walls shall comply with the same setback requirements from rights of way and property lines as are required for drives and parking. When landscaping is required along the base of a wall, setbacks shall be increased, if necessary, so that a minimum ten (10) foot planting area is provided that is free from any easements, overhead or underground utilities, or other encumbrances that might prevent the installation of required landscaping. 
d.  The director of development may waive any requirements of subsections 8.a. through 8.c. above, at the time of site plan review if it is determined that the visibility or impact of a wall is adequately minimized due to its location, orientation or other conditions in the vicinity of the wall. 
e.  Retaining walls four (4) feet tall and higher shall incorporate permanent fencing or railing on the upper side of the wall, and if visible from outside the property lines, such fencing or railing shall be decorative in design. Fencing or railing shall be a minimum height of forty-eight (48) inches. If vehicle parking areas or drives exist on the upper side of the wall without sufficient physical impediment to a vehicle reaching the wall, at least one (1) of the following measures shall be incorporated between the fence and the vehicle area: Vehicle guardrails, earth berms at least three (3) feet high above grade on the approach side, or concrete filled steel bollards spaced four and one-half (4.5) feet on center. The fencing or railing shall meet the minimum standards for lateral impact loading, height and separation of vertical members. 
f.  Retaining walls greater than four (4) feet in height may require a building permit, as required by the city engineer. 
9.  Portable storage units. Portable storage units shall be permitted on residential lots, subject to the following requirements. 
a.  The total area encompassed by portable storage units on any single lot shall not exceed one hundred seventy (170) square feet. 
b.  Portable storage units shall only be located in the side or rear yard. Placement of the unit shall meet the required setbacks for buildings in the zoning district in which it is placed. Portable storage units shall be located no further than fifty (50) feet from the dwelling unit and shall be no closer than five (5) feet to the dwelling, as measured from the nearest point of the portable storage unit to the dwelling. 
c.  A portable storage unit shall be located on a lot for a maximum of sixty (60) days, consecutive or not, including redelivery, within a one hundred eighty-day period. 
d.  In the case of a portable storage unit located on the lot for the purpose of storing construction materials, equipment and household goods during the remodeling, alteration or expansion of a residential dwelling or accessory structure, the portable storage unit may be permitted on the property for up to 180 days. 
e.  No portable storage unit shall be used to store solid waste, business inventory, or commercial goods. No property other than property normally located on the lot on which the portable storage unit is located shall be stored within the portable storage unit. 
10.  Sight distance triangle. 
a.  No parking spaces will be permitted on corner lots within the sight distance triangles, as defined in subsection b. 
b.  Sight triangle (vision triangle or sight distance triangle) means the triangular area formed by a diagonal line connecting two (2) points located on intersecting street right-of-way lines (or a right-of-way line and the curb or edge of a driveway). The sight triangle may consist of one (1) or two (2) different configurations. Intersections of streets may consist of a combination of the various geometric designs given below: 
(1)  At intersections with streets having speed limits that are greater than or equal to forty (40) miles per hour (mph), a minimum sight triangle fifteen (15) feet by sixty (60) feet is required with the longer dimension parallel to any street with a speed limit that is greater than or equal to forty (40) mph. 
(2)  At intersections with streets having a speed limit that is less than or equal to thirty-five (35) mph, a minimum sight triangle of fifteen (15) feet by forty-five (45) feet is required with the longer dimension parallel to any street with a speed limit that is equal to or less than thirty-five (35) mph. 
c.  Visual obstruction. 
(1)  On a corner lot in any district which normally requires a building line setback of twenty (20) feet or more, no obstructions shall be permitted that exceed a height of two and one-half (21/2) feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets in the sight triangle bounded by the street lines of such corner lots, and a line joining points along said street lines twenty-five (25) feet from the point of intersection. 
(2)  No fence, shrub, barrier, wall or other obstruction shall be permitted within twenty (20) feet of any intersection of any street or alley which is used by the general public in any district, if the director of development determines it to be a visual or safety hazard to motorists, pedestrians or the general public. 
11.  Yard encroachments. 
a.  No yard or other space provided about any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance shall be considered as providing a yard or other open space for any other building, and no yard or other open space on one (1) lot shall be considered as providing a yard or open space on any other lot. 
b.  Every part of every required yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as hereinafter provided or as otherwise permitted in this ordinance. 
c.  Unenclosed porches or terraces not over three (3) feet above the ground, except for railings and roof structure, may extend five (5) feet into a required front yard, ten (10) feet into a required rear yard, and three (3) feet into a required side yard.

(4)  All connecting cables shall be buried; and 
(5)  The side yard includes the area between the front line of the building (excluding steps) and the rear line of the building (excluding steps). 
h.  On all lots adjacent to, and lots located in a cul-de-sac area, accessory building or structures shall not be located in any rear or side yard area which would be continuous to the required front yard setback area of the adjoining lot. 
13.  Drainage. No building shall be erected on any land and no change shall be made in the existing contours of any land, including any change in the course, width or elevation of any natural or other drainage channel, in any manner, that will obstruct, interfere with, or substantially change the drainage from such land to the detriment of neighboring lands. Factors to be considered in determining substantial change shall include the recommendations of the City of Hopewell Storm Drainage Study, and adopted drainage standards of the Virginia Highway Commission. In his administration of this requirement, the director of development shall refer any application submitted to him to the city engineer for a recommendation in the matter. 
14.  Erection of building. Every building hereafter erected in business and residential zoning districts shall be located on a building site as herein defined, said lot having its principal frontage on a public street of record, except as otherwise permitted in this ordinance for townhouses and planned development. 
15.  Obstruction of public right-of-way. No building, structure, sign, merchandise, or other obstruction shall be located, constructed or encroach on any public right-of-way. 
16.  Temporary and permanent office trailers. 
a.  Definitions: 
(1)  Temporary office trailer means an office trailer to be located and used in conjunction with and during the time of a construction project. 
(2)  Permanent office trailer means an office trailer other than noted above. 
b.  Use regulations: 
(1)  Temporary office trailers are allowed in all districts with the approval of the director of development during the time beginning on the date of issuance of the building permit and ending fifteen (15) days after the date of issuance of the permanent certificate of occupancy. Such approval shall be in the form of a permit of six (6) months duration, which may be renewed with sufficient evidence of construction progress. 
(2)  Permanent office trailers are allowed only in the M-1 and M-2 districts, except that no permanent office trailer shall be located within six hundred (600) feet of the right-of-way of LaPrade Avenue, (includes 6th Street from Winston Churchill Drive to N&W Railroad tracks, as renamed by City Council on October 23, 1984) Elm Street, Route 10 and Winston Churchill Drive. 
c.  Except as provided above, no other permanent or temporary office trailers are allowed in the city. 
17.  Trailers, recreational vehicles and oversized vehicles. 
a.  The parking or storage of trailers or semi-trailers, motor coaches or motor homes, recreational vehicles, and oversized vehicles in a residential or commercial district, except as hereinafter provided, is prohibited. 
(1)  A trailer or semi-trailer designed for vacation or camping purposes, a utility or boat trailer, and recreational vehicles may be parked or stored on private property in any district, and shall not be parked as to cause a visual obstruction to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
(2)  A trailer or semi-trailer may be located in a commercial district for repairs to the trailer, sale of trailers, etc., in conjunction with an otherwise permitted use.

Average height of earthen berms used to satisfy this requirement shall be three (3) feet in height. 
4.  Where appropriate, existing vegetation may be used to satisfy this requirement. Existing vegetation may be required to be supplemented with additional evergreen material in order to meet the buffering requirements. The need for additional evergreen material shall be determined during the site development plan review process. 
D. - Exterior lighting. 
1.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of outdoor lighting is to provide a safe, secure, enjoyable, productive nighttime environment for both pedestrians and vehicles, while enhancing lighting efficiency. These regulations are designed to protect the general welfare by allowing exterior lighting to efficiently light areas, controlling the spillover of light onto adjacent properties, and protect the public safety by preventing glare from outdoor luminaries. The following standards are intended to control the direction of light emitted from luminaries, and limit the intensity of light reaching certain adjacent properties. 
2.  Standards. 
a.  Light sources shall not cast excessive light upon adjacent property or upon a public right-of-way. The maintained horizontal illuminance at grade at adjoining streets shall not exceed 0.5 foot candles, and the maintained horizontal illuminance at grade at adjoining residential properties shall not exceed 0.1 foot candles. 
b.  Light trespass shall be controlled or reduced through the use of properly designed luminaries suitable for the task; use of internal or external reflectors and visors; optimum location or placement of luminaries and adjustment or proper selection of mounting height of post, pole or building mounted luminaries, and other methods. 
c.  Light diffusers and ambient light may be visible from adjacent property if the light defusers shield or diffuse the light source. 
d.  Poles supporting lights shall be no taller than twenty (20) feet in a residential district, twenty-five (25) feet in a commercial or office district or a commercial part of a planned development residential district, and thirty (30) feet in any industrial district. 
e.  This section shall not apply to the light sources on public utility poles in the public right-of-way or to public street lights, which shall meet roadway lighting standards of IES and VDOT for the appropriate roadway classification. 
f.  All exterior lights will be full cutoff luminaries. Exterior lighting shall be designed at or below the following average maintained horizontal illuminance levels for the various uses. Uniformity shall not exceed the ratio listed below, which is a measure of the maximum lighting achieved within the area to the minimum lighting within the area.

E. - Off-street parking and loading. 
1.  Purpose and intent. The minimum off-street parking standards below are intended to effectively manage traffic flows and provide for an adequate number of parking spaces for vehicles while creating and maintaining vehicle areas that are safe, attractive, and functional for both pedestrians and motorists. In addition, consistent with the objective to reduce impervious surfaces, these standards are intended to promote improved management of storm water in parking areas by limiting the number of spaces permitted and encouraging acceptable techniques of low impact design in the provision of essential parking areas. 
2.  Off-Street parking and loading required. 
a.  Every use or structure instituted, constructed, erected, enlarged, or structurally altered after the adoption of this ordinance shall provide off-street parking and loading facilities in accordance with the provisions of this section E except as otherwise provided for herein. 
b.  Such off-street parking and loading facilities shall be maintained and continued by the owner or operator of the use as long as the use is continued. 
c.  No owner or operator of any use affected by this section E shall discontinue, change, or dispense with the required parking and loading facilities without establishing alternative vehicular parking and loading facilities which meet the requirements of this section E. Owners or operators that wish to establish alternative vehicular parking and loading facilities must submit an off-street parking and loading plan to the department of development in accordance with site plan requirements of article XVI. 
d.  No person, firm or corporation shall operate a use without providing off-street parking and loading facilities that meet the requirements of and be in compliance with this section E. Off-Street parking and loading facilities shall be approved by the department of development during the site plan process before a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
e.  When a permitted use is nonconforming as to required parking, and the square footage of the said use is enlarged, additional parking shall be required only to the extent made necessary by the enlargement of the permitted use. 
f.  No enlargement of a building, structure or use shall be made in such a way as to reduce the number of existing parking or loading spaces below the minimum number required unless provisions are made elsewhere, as permitted by this ordinance, to replace any required spaces which may have been removed. Additional parking or loading spaces shall be provided to accommodate any additional demand created by such enlargement. 
g.  Off-street parking shall not be required for uses located in the downtown central business district to the extent provided for in article IX of this ordinance. 
h.  Single-family residential dwellings shall comply with driveway layout and construction standards, as determined by the city engineer. 
3.  General provisions. 
a.  Off-street parking facilities required hereunder shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land that they are intended to serve; provided, however, that when the size or shape of land, or a nonconforming building or structure presently existing on the parcel of land, prevents the establishment of such facilities on the same lot or parcel, such facilities may be established off-site under the following conditions. 
(1)  Such parking shall be on a properly zoned lot or parcel within three hundred (300) feet of the premises they are to serve. 
(2)  Before such parking facilities are approved, a written agreement assuring their retention and availability for such purposes shall be executed by the parties concerned, and approved as to form by the city attorney. The agreement shall be recorded with the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the City of Hopewell providing that any shared parking required and permitted will not be alienated from the use for which it is required unless other arrangements acceptable to the director of development and the city attorney are made to provide the required parking. The agreement also shall be filed with the director of development. 
(3)  No commercial or industrial repair work of any kind shall be conducted in shared parking areas. 
(4)  No sign of any kind, other than designating ownership, entrances, exits and conditions of use, shall be erected on shared parking areas. 
(5)  The shared parking area shall be subject to all requirements of this ordinance concerning surfacing, lighting, buffering, drainage, landscaping, and screening. 
b.  Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent provisions for the joint use of off-street parking facilities for two (2) or more buildings or uses by two (2) or more owners or operators, provided that the total number of such parking spaces when combined or used together shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses computed separately in accordance with this section E. However, before such spaces are approved for use, a written agreement assuring their retention and availability for such purposes shall be executed by the parties concerned and approved as to form by the city attorney. The agreement shall be recorded with the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the City of Hopewell, providing that any shared parking required and permitted will not be alienated from the use for which it is required unless other arrangements acceptable to the director of development and the city attorney are made to provide the required parking. The agreement also shall be filed with the director of development. If the combined use of the same parking spaces by two (2) or more principal uses involves off-site parking spaces, then the provisions of subsection 2.a. above shall also apply. 
c.  In calculating the number of required parking spaces, the following rules shall govern: 
(1)  Parking and loading requirements shall be determined by floor area of the building, structure, or total square footage devoted to the use, and loading requirements per seat or seating space shall be determined by the number of fixed seats, except as otherwise required. Floor area shall mean the gross floor area of the specific use. 
(2)  When the units of measurements determining the number of required parking spaces result in the requirements of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded, and fractions over one-half shall require one (1) additional parking space, except as otherwise expressly required in this ordinance. 
(3)  The parking space requirement for a use not expressly mentioned herein shall be the same as required for a use of similar nature as determined by the director of development or his designee. 
(4)  In the case of mixed uses, the parking spaces required shall equal the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately. 
(5)  Off-street parking facilities supplied to meet the needs of one (1) use shall not be considered as meeting the off-street parking needs of any other use, except as otherwise authorized herein. 
d.  Parking requirements may be waived or modified under the following circumstances. 
(1)  When the required number of parking spaces is increased by less than twenty (20) percent due to a change in use or occupancy, parking facilities shall be provided for the increase, but not for any lawfully existing, nonconforming deficiency in such facilities. Parking increases shall be approved by the director of development. 
(2)  When the required number of parking spaces is increased by more than twenty (20) percent due to a change in use or occupancy, (including in the aggregate all increases from the date of adoption of this ordinance) parking facilities in conformity with the requirements of this ordinance shall be provided on premises for the entire building, structure or use. The director of development shall have the authority to adjust off-street parking requirements for additions to existing structures, subject to the physical ability to develop such off-street parking facilities. 
(3)  Due to the complexities of any given development, the strict application of the number of parking spaces set forth in the table of parking requirements may result in a development either with inadequate parking spaces or parking spaces in excess of the number reasonably needed. In such cases, the director of development or his designee may authorize a modification of the parking space requirements, if he finds that, in the particular case, the peculiar nature of the use, the exceptional shape or size of the property, or any other exceptional situation or condition would justify such modification. Any such modifications shall be accompanied by written findings consistent with the procedures and criteria set forth below: 
(a)  The director of development shall require a parking demand and utilization study to be submitted by the applicant, documenting the justification for an alternative number of parking spaces. The study shall be based upon recognized national studies and resources, such as, but not limited to, The Parking Generation Manual prepared by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. 
(b)  The study shall take into consideration potential pedestrian traffic, mass transit, characteristics of the occupants or employees, characteristics of uses for sharing of parking, and other pertinent variables related to the actual demand for parking spaces. 
(c)  The director of development, based upon this study and other relevant information, may reduce the number of parking spaces, permit additional spaces, or allow for shared parking under terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the director of development. 
(d)  The director of development's discretion and authority under this subsection d.(3) shall apply only to the number of spaces required for off-street parking and shall not apply to any other requirement for parking areas. 
4.  General design requirements. 
a.  Ingress and egress to the property, and traffic lanes, parking spaces and loading and service areas on the premises shall form a convenient and well-organized system appropriate to the uses in the building.

d.  Except where a wall is required, a minimum six (6) inch high vertical concrete curb shall be constructed so that no part of a vehicle extends beyond the property line or into pedestrian access areas and sidewalks. 
6.  Parking area surfaces. 
a.  Surfacing of parking area: Off-Street parking areas for five (5) or more cars, or loading or service areas, shall be graded and surfaced with a stable material, that will not track onto pavement, such as asphalt, concrete or an acceptable alternate that will provide equivalent protection against potholes, erosion, and dust. Construction shall be to recognized and adopted standards and engineering guidelines as determined by the director of public works and city engineer. This requirement shall also apply to interior travel lanes, and lanes for drive-in windows and driveways. 
b.  Parking areas that are not provided with the type of surface specified in subsection a. of this section shall be graded and surfaced with crushed stone, gravel, crushed shell or other suitable material to provide a surface that is stable, and will help to reduce dust and erosion, and will reduce the impervious character of the surface. The perimeter of such parking areas shall be defined by bricks, stones, or other similar devices as approved by the director of development and city engineer. 
c.  Parking areas and spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection a. of this section shall be appropriately delineated with painted lines or plastic striping or other safety markings which shall provide a permanent delineation between spaces. 
d.  Parking areas shall be properly maintained in all respects. Parking area surfaces shall be kept in good repair and condition allowing the unimpeded movement of vehicles, and parking space lines or markings shall be kept clearly visible and distinct. 
e.  In heavy vehicular use areas (e.g. maintenance, garbage collection, deliveries, etc.), reinforced surfaces shall be used in the vehicle movement areas to prevent surface or structural failure, damage of parking, and movement areas. 
7.  Loading and unloading areas. Whenever the normal operation of any use requires that goods, merchandise, or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from a site, a sufficient off-street loading and unloading area shall be provided in accordance with this section to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and convenient manner. The loading and unloading area shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers and types of vehicles that will use the area, given the nature of the use. 
a.  Each loading area intended for a semi-tractor trailer shall have a minimum dimension of twelve (12) feet by fifty-five (55) feet and overhead clearance of fourteen (14) feet from the driveway or street grade. The following table indicates the number of loading and unloading spaces required by the floor area of the building.

f.  Loading and unloading facilities shall be located at the side or rear of the primary structure and screened from view from all public rights-of-way. 
8.  Parking facilities for the physically handicapped. 
a.  Parking spaces for the physically handicapped shall be located within parking areas as closely as possible to ramps, walkways, entrances, and elevators. Where feasible, these parking spaces shall be located so that the physically handicapped are not forced to wheel or walk across main traffic lanes or behind parked cars to reach the ramps and other facilities. The spaces shall be situated in those areas of the vehicle parking area located nearest to each primary building entrance. 
b.  Each parking space for the physically handicapped shall be at least eighteen and one-half (18.5) feet in length and sixteen (16) feet in width, which width includes a loading and unloading area eight (8) feet in width for single spaces and four (4) feet in width for contiguous spaces. Such spaces shall be arranged and dispersed throughout the vehicle parking area so as to provide convenient access to all major entrances of the proposed business or businesses. 
c.  The following number of parking spaces shall be reserved for the physically handicapped based upon the total number of spaces provided in any parking area.

2.  To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest when, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions will result in unnecessary hardship; provided that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done, as follows: 
a.  When a property owner can show that his property was acquired in good faith and where by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the effective date of the ordinance, or where by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or of the use or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of the terms of the ordinance would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property; or where the board is satisfied, upon the evidence heard by it, that the granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant, provided that all variances shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and purpose of the ordinance. 
b.  No such variance shall be authorized by the board unless it finds: (a) that the strict application of the ordinance would produce undue hardship; (b) that such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district in the same vicinity; and (c) that the authorization of such variance will not be substantially detrimental to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance. 
c.  No such variance shall be authorized except after notice and hearing as required by Code of Virginia, § 15.1-431, as amended. 
d.  No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that the condition or situation of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practical the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the ordinance.

Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
ARTICLE XXI. - AMENDMENTS 

A. - Initiation. 
1.  Whenever public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning practice require, city council may amend, supplement, or change this ordinance, including the schedule of district regulations and the official zoning map. Any such amendment may be initiated by resolution of city council, by motion of the planning commission, or by petition of any property owner addressed to city council. Such petition shall be in writing, and when any such petition by a property owner be for the reclassification or rezoning of any property, there shall be attached to such petition the names and addresses, if known, of the owner or owners of the lots or property included in the proposed change, and of the property adjacent thereto. Such petition shall be simultaneously sent to the planning commission for its consideration and recommendation to city council, as provided below. 
2.  A petition for an amendment may be withdrawn at any time but, if the planning commission has commenced its hearing on the petition, a petition covering any of the same described land will not be considered within twelve (12) months of withdrawal. This provision shall not be held to impair the right of either the planning commission or the city council to propose any amendment to this ordinance on their motion at any time. 
B. - Action by planning commission. 
1.  No zoning ordinance shall be adopted, amended, or re-enacted unless city council has referred the proposal to the planning commission for its recommendation. The commission shall hold at least one (1) public hearing on such proposed amendment, after notice as required by Code of Virginia, § 15.1-431 as amended. Following the hearing, the planning commission shall prepare and by motion adopt its recommendations, which may include changes in the original proposal resulting from the hearing, and shall transmit such recommendations, together with any explanatory matter, to the city council. 
2.  In recommending the adoption of any amendment to this ordinance, the planning commission shall fully state its reasons for any such recommendations, describing any change in conditions, if any, that it believes makes the amendment advisable and specifically setting forth the manner in which, in its opinion, the amendment would be in harmony with the comprehensive plan of the city and would be in furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance. 
C. - Action by city council. 
    Before approving the proposed amendment, the city council shall hold at least one (1) public hearing thereon, pursuant to public notice as required by Code of Virginia, § 15.1-431 as amended, after which the city council may make appropriate changes or corrections in the proposed amendment; provided, however, that no additional land may be zoned to a different classification than was contained in the public notice without an additional public notice as required by Code of Virginia, § 15.1-431 as amended. An affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of the city council shall be required to amend or re-enact a zoning ordinance. 
D. - Conditional and special use permits. 
1.  Conditional use permit. 
    Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide for certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics or potential impacts on adjacent land uses, are not generally permitted in certain zoning districts as a matter of right, but which may, under the right set of circumstances and conditions, be acceptable in certain specific locations. These uses are permitted only through the issuance of a conditional use permit by the city council after ensuring that the use can be appropriately accommodated on the specific property, will be in conformance with the comprehensive plan, can be constructed and operated in a manner which is compatible with the surrounding land uses and overall character of the community, and that the public interest and general welfare of the citizens of the city will be protected. 
    No inherent right exists to receive a conditional use permit; such permits are a special privilege granted by the city council under a specific set of circumstances and conditions, and each application and situation is unique. Consequently, mere compliance with the generally applicable requirements may not be sufficient, and additional measures, occasionally substantial, may be necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed development. In other situations, no set of conditions would be sufficient to approve an application, even though the same request in another location would be approved. 
a.  Initiation. The applicant, who shall be an owner of record or contract owner with written approval of the owner of the land involved (if a contract owner, a copy of said contract shall be filed with and made a part of application), shall make application for the use permit to the Director of Development on the form provided for that purpose, giving all information required by such form, including such other information which the Director of Development may deem necessary for an intelligent consideration of the project for which a permit is desired. 
b.  Completeness. 
(1)  A pre-application conference may be scheduled by the applicant with the director of development or his designated agent to discuss the proposal. 
(2)  The application shall be accompanied by the required number of copies of the following: 
i.  A site plan in accordance with article XVI, site plan requirements, of the zoning ordinance. 
ii.  The front, side and rear elevations and floor plans of the proposed buildings. 
c.  Review of application. 
(1)  When the director has certified that the application is complete, it shall be deemed received and referred to the planning commission for its review and recommendation to city council. 
(2)  The planning commission shall, within ninety (90) days after the first meeting of the planning commission after such referral, report to the city council its recommendation as to the approval or disapproval of such application and any recommendation for establishment of conditions, in addition to those set forth in this article, deemed necessary to protect the public interest and welfare. Failure of the planning commission to report within ninety (90) days shall be deemed a recommendation of approval. 
(3)  Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission, the City Council, after public notice in accordance with Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2204, shall hold at least one public hearing on such application, and as a result thereof, shall either approve or deny the request. 
(4)  In approving any conditional use permit, the city council may impose conditions or limitations on any approval as it may deem necessary to protect the public interest and welfare. Such additional standards may include, but need not be limited to: 
i.  Special setbacks, yard or construction requirements, increased screening or landscaping requirements, area requirements, development phasing, and standards pertaining to traffic, circulation, noise, lighting, hours of operation and similar characteristics; and 
ii.  A performance guarantee, acceptable in form, content and amount to the City, posted by the applicant to ensure continued compliance with all conditions and requirements as may be specified. 
d.  Approval criteria. As may be specified within each zoning district, uses permitted subject to conditional use review criteria shall be permitted only after review by the planning commission and approval by the city council only if the applicant demonstrates that: 
(1)  The proposed conditional use is in compliance with all regulations of the applicable zoning district, the provisions of this article, and any applicable general provisions as set forth in the zoning ordinance. 
(2)  The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the proposed use is not detrimental to, and will not endanger, the public health, safety, morals, comfort, or general welfare. 
(3)  The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially impair the use of other property within the immediate proximity. 
(4)  The proposed conditional use conforms to the character of the neighborhood within the same zoning district in which it is located. The proposal as submitted or modified shall have no more adverse effects on health, safety or comfort of persons living or working in or driving through the neighborhood, and shall be no more injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, than would any other use generally permitted in the same district. In making such a determination, consideration shall be given to the location, type, size, and height of buildings or structures, type and extent of landscaping and screening on the site, and whether the proposed use is consistent with any theme, action, policy or map of the comprehensive plan. 
(5)  The exterior architectural appeal and function plan of any proposed structure will not be so at variance with either the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the structures already constructed or in the course of construction in the immediate neighborhood or the character of the applicable zoning district, and shall enhance the quality of the neighborhood. 
(6)  The public interest and welfare supporting the proposed conditional use is sufficient to outweigh the individual interests which are adversely affected by the establishment of the proposed use. 
(7)  The proposed use will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of any feature determined to be of significant ecological, scenic or historic importance. 
e.  Recordation of conditional use permit. A certified copy of all ordinances and resolutions authorizing a conditional use permit pursuant to this section shall be recorded at the expense of the applicant in the name of the property owner as grantor in the office of the clerk of the circuit court. No conditional use permit shall become effective until so recorded. 
f.  Other laws applicable. The granting of a conditional use does not exempt the applicant from obtaining a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, or complying with all other requirements of this ordinance or any applicable city, state or federal law. 
g.  Denial of a conditional use permit. If the city council finds that an application for a conditional use will not conform to the general character of the neighborhood to which the proposed use will apply, or that the public health, safety and general welfare of such neighborhood will not be secure by granting such conditional use, or that the approval criteria outlined in subsection d. of article XVIII, section G. have not been met, then the city council may deny such application, anything in this ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding. 
h.  Effect of denial of a conditional use. 
(1)  No application for a conditional use which has been denied wholly or in part by the city council shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of said denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions found to be valid by the city council. 
(2)  The city council may, at any time, consider a new application affecting the same property as an application previously denied. A new application is one that differs in some substantial way from the one previously considered, as determined by the director of development. 
(3)  A newly submitted conditional use permit application must follow procedures as outlined in subsections a., initiation, and b., completeness of section G., conditional use permits. 
i.  Scope of approval. 
(1)  Unless otherwise specified by the conditions of the permit, the applicant has one (1) year to establish the conditional use. Failure to establish the conditional use authorized by the permit within one (1) year from the date of approval by the city council shall cause the permit to terminate and to become void. The approval of a new conditional use permit shall be required. 
(2)  The provisions of this section are cumulative with the power of injunction and other remedies afforded by law to the city, and further shall not be so interpreted as to vest in any applicant any rights inconsistent or in conflict with the power of the city to rezone the subject property or to exercise any other power provided by law. 
(3)  Once a conditional use permit is granted, such use may be enlarged, extended, increased in intensity or relocated only in accordance with the provisions of subsection k. The provisions of article XVII, relative to expansion of nonconforming uses shall not be construed to supersede this requirement unless the permitted use for which the conditional use permit was initially granted is in fact, no longer a use for which the conditional use permit was initially granted and no longer a use permitted by right or as a conditional use in the zoning district in which located. 
(4)  Where any conditional use is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of two (2) years or more, the conditional use permit shall terminate and become null and void. A use shall be deemed to have been "discontinued" when the use shall have ceased for any reason, regardless of the intent of the owner or occupier of the property to reinstitute the use at some later date. The approval of a new conditional use permit shall be required prior to any subsequent reinstatement of the use. 
j.  Revocation of conditional use permits. Complaints concerning the operation or function of a conditional use may be reported to the department of development. Such complaints shall be documented and researched by the director of development or his designee. 
(1)  Grounds for revocation shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
i.  A change in conditions affecting the public health, safety and welfare since the adoption of the conditional use permit; or 
ii.  Violations of this article, violations of regulations applicable to the underlying zoning district, or violations of any conditions attached to the conditional use permit, by the owner/operator of the use; or 
iii.  Fraudulent, false or misleading information supplied by the applicant (or his agent) for the conditional use permit; or 
iv.  An error or mistake in fact that led to decision made by the city council when approving the conditional use permit. 
(2)  If it is determined by the director of development or his designee that the conditional use is in violation of one (1) or more of the items listed above, the owner of the property will be notified by certified letter of the violations and may be given a reasonable time to rectify said violation(s). 
(3)  If the violation(s) are not fully rectified within the allotted time, the city may begin the revocation process. 
(4)  The revocation process is generally as follows: 
i.  At least one public hearing shall be held, in accordance with Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2204 before the planning commission, outlining the violations of the conditional use permit. The planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council. 
ii.  Upon receipt of the recommendation of the planning commission, the city council, after public notice in accordance with Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2204, shall hold a public hearing on such application and shall act on the proposal to revoke the conditional use permit. 
iii.  If the city council revokes the conditional use permit, the permit shall become null and void. 
iv.  In order to reestablish the conditional use, the applicant must file a new conditional use permit application in accordance with subsection a., Initiation and subsection b., completeness, must meet the standards as outlined in subsection d., approval criteria of this article, and must receive approval of the city council. 
(5)  The city reserves the right to revoke immediately any conditional use permit violating the terms of the zoning ordinance, without going through the procedures outlined above, if revocation is deemed appropriate by the city council. 
k.  Amendment of conditional use permits. A request for an amendment shall include any enlargement, expansion, increase in intensity, relocation, or modification of any condition of a previously approved and currently valid conditional use. Amendments shall be processed as follows: 
(1)  Non-material and insignificant (minor) modifications. An amendment that requires the following shall be considered a minor modification: 
Shifts in on-site location, and changes in size or intensity of less than five (5) percent; or a five (5) percent or less increase or decrease in either lot coverage or floor area over what was originally approved. 
Minor modifications may be authorized by the director, provided that such minor changes comply with the following criteria: 
i.  No previous minor modification has been granted pursuant to this subsection; 
ii.  There will be no detrimental impact to or on any adjacent property caused by significant change in the appearance or the use of the property or any other contributing factor; 
iii.  Nothing in the currently valid conditional use permit precludes or otherwise limits such expansion or enlargement; 
iv.  The proposal conforms to the provisions of this article and is in keeping with the spirit and intent of the adopted comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Major amendments. Any proposed amendment other than those provided for in subsection k(1) above shall be considered a major amendment of a previously approved and currently valid conditional use and shall be considered according to the provisions outlined in subsections a., b., c., and d. of this section. 
(3)  Nonconforming uses. For an existing and currently valid conditional use permit which is no longer allowed as a conditional use in the zoning district in which located, the city council, after recommendation by the planning commission, may approve an amendment to said permit, provided such amendment does not allow the use to be enlarged, expanded, increased in intensity, relocated, or continued beyond any limitation specified in the existing use permit or established in article XVII, nonconforming uses. 
2.  Special use permit. When a nonconforming structure or a conforming structure devoted to a nonconforming activity is destroyed or damaged in any manner to the extent that the cost of restoration to its condition before the occurrence shall exceed fifty (50) percent of the assessed value as recorded in the real estate assessment office, it may be repaired or restored only after the issuance of a special use permit by the board of zoning appeals. In approving such permit, the board shall consider the stated purpose of establishing the zoning district in which the structure is located; the uses in the area immediately surrounding the structure in question, particularly the other nonconforming uses; and the hardship which would result from a denial of the special use permit. The permit shall include conditions as to the time within which the repair or restoration must be started and completed and may contain any other conditions regarding the repair and restoration which in the opinion of the board shall be necessary to carry out the intent of this section and the ordinance. 
3.  Procedures. The procedure governing the application for and the granting of special use permits where required by the zoning ordinance shall be as follows: 
a.  The applicant, who shall be an owner of record or contract owner with written approval of owner of the land involved (if a contract owner, a copy of said contract shall be filed with and made a part of application), shall make application for the use permit to the zoning administrator on the form provided for that purpose, giving all information required by such form, including such other information which the zoning administrator may deem necessary for an intelligent consideration of the project for which a permit is desired. The application shall be accompanied by the required number of copies of the following. 
b.  A site plan in accordance with article XVI of the zoning ordinance. 
c.  The front, side and rear elevations and floor plans of the proposed buildings. 
d.  The zoning administrator shall thereupon submit the application and copies of the site plan to the board of zoning appeals for a special use permit. No such use permits shall be authorized except after notice and hearing as required by Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2204, as amended. 
e.  The zoning administrator shall also transmit a copy of the application to the planning commission which may send a recommendation to the board of zoning appeals, or appear as a part at the hearing. 
f.  Upon the granting of a use permit, one (1) copy of the site plan, upon which has been indicated the changes or restrictions, if any, required by the board of zoning appeals, shall be returned to the applicant, who may thereafter conduct the operations for which the permit has been granted only in such manner and for such a time as the permit and the certified drawing shall specify. A use permit shall be valid for only the specific use it covers in the specific location designated. 
g.  Recordation of special use permit. A certified copy of all special use permits issued pursuant to this section shall be recorded at the expense of the applicant in the name of the property owner as grantor in the office of the clerk of the circuit court. No special use permit shall become effective until so recorded. 
E. - Reserved. 
F. - Uses not provided for. 
1.  If, in any district established under this ordinance, a use is not specifically permitted and an application is made by a property owner to the administrator for such use, the administrator shall refer the application to the planning commission. The planning commission shall make its recommendations to the governing body within sixty (60) days as to whether (a) to amend the ordinance to allow the unrestricted use in that district, (b) to amend the ordinance to allow the use with a conditional use permit, (c) to amend the ordinance by rezoning the district and thereby allow the use, or (d) to deny the use in that district. The planning commission may hold a separate public hearing or a joint public hearing, as provided by law, with the governing body. 
2.  If, after sixty (60) days, after the first meeting of the planning commission, no public hearing has been set or no recommendation has been made, the governing body may assume that the planning commission concurs with the applicant.
