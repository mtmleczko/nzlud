PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Richmond, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the City Commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Howard George, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Terri Vela, City Manager, Ms. Laura Scarlato, City Secretary, and Mr. Frank Garza, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

To implement such policy, the city commission deems it advisable to enact a code of ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, to serve not only as a guide for official conduct of the city's public servants, but also as a basis for establishing accountability for those who refuse to abide by its terms.

If the hearing officer finds that grounds do exist for revocation of the permit, he shall revoke such; provided, however, if the city sought revocation for reasons under subsection (g)(1)a, b, c, h and/or i of this section and no grounds exist for revocation under subsection (g)(1)d, e, f or g of this section, the hearing officer may deny the request for revocation if he finds that the needs of the animals and the public interest will be adequately protected by a warning. 
d.  If the hearing officer finds that on the date of the hearing the conditions which were set out in the notice as grounds of denial, suspension or revocation of the permit do not exist, he shall order such permit issued or reinstated.

If there is a dispute between the inspector and a person applying for a permit for a place for which a permit was revoked as to whether the adequate precautions have been taken so the conditions under which the permit was revoked will not reoccur, the applicant may request a hearing before the hearing officer. Such hearing shall be conducted under the same procedures as a hearing for a suspension or revocation of a permit; however, the burden shall be on the applicant to show that adequate precautions have been taken so that the conditions under which the permit was revoked will not reoccur.

ARTICLE IV. - POSTCONSTRUCTION STORMWATER RUNOFF 

Sec. 10-89. - General provisions. 
(a)  Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. 
(2)  Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels; 
(2)  Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
(3)  Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; 
(4)  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety. 
(c)  Applicability. 
(1)  This article shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the city under the specifications of section 10-92. This article also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. In addition, all plans must ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans. 
(2)  To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the city has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing five acres or more of land. The following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance criteria: 
a.  Additions or modifications to existing single family structures; 
b.  Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land, provided they are not part of a larger common development plan; 
c.  Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by the city. 
(3)  When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in section 10-90, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the current stormwater design manual. These criteria are dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the city. 
(d)  Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
(e)  Development of a stormwater design manual. 
(1)  The city may furnish additional policy, criteria and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article and may provide such information in the form of a stormwater design manual. 
(2)  This manual will include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the local review authority, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.

Sec. 10-93. - General performance criteria for stormwater management. 
    Unless judged by the city to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites: 
(1)  All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. 
(2)  All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local water body without adequate treatment. 
(3)  For new development, structural stormwater treatment practices shall be designed to remove 80 percent of the average annual post development total suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a STP complies with this performance standard if it is: 
a.  Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQv); 
b.  Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in the local stormwater design manual; 
c.  Constructed properly; and 
d.  Maintained regularly. 
(4)  Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites. 
(5)  Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the city to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements.

(b)  As-built plans. All applicants are required to submit actual as-built plans for any stormwater management practices located on-site after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the city is required before the release of any performance securities can occur. 
(c)  Landscaping and stabilization requirements. Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within ten days from the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts: 
(1)  Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over 90 percent of the seeded area. 
(2)  Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. 
(3)  Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of 75 percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. 
(4)  Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum 75 percent survival for a one-year is achieved. 
(d)  Landscaping plan. In addition to the requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section, a landscaping plan must be submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect and must be approved prior to receiving a permit. 
(Ord. No. 2011-02, § 8, 3-21-2011) 
Sec. 10-97. - Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities. 
(a)  Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has an stormwater management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city, or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this article. The easement agreement shall be recorded in the land records. 
(b)  Maintenance covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the city and recorded into the land record prior to final plan approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts. 
(c)  Requirements for maintenance covenants. All stormwater management facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this article and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the city, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility. 
(d)  Inspection of stormwater facilities. Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis, including, but not limited to, routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to, reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater treatment practices. 
(e)  Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new drainage control facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the city the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. 
(f)  Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least five years. These records shall be made available to the city during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request. 
(g)  Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have ten days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner. After proper notice, the city may assess the owner of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes.

(Ord. No. 96-07, § 1, 7-8-1996) 
Editor's note- The preamble to Ordinance No. 96-07 is a follows: 
    WHEREAS, the Texas Legislature has determined that the unrestricted location of certain sexually-oriented businesses may be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare by contributing to the decline of residential and business neighborhoods and the growth of criminal activity; and 
    WHEREAS, Section 243.003 of the Local Government Code authorizes a municipality to adopt regulations regarding sexually oriented businesses, which are defined in Section 243.002 to include a sex parlor, nude studio, modeling studio, love parlor, adult bookstore, adult movie theater, adult video arcade, adult movie arcade, adult video store, adult motel, or other commercial enterprise the primary business of which is the offering of a service or the selling, renting, or exhibiting of devices or any other items intended to provide sexual stimulation or sexual gratification to the customer; and 
    WHEREAS, residents of the City of Richmond have requested that the City Commission consider an ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses, due to the negative secondary effects of such businesses on surrounding neighborhoods; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds that sexually oriented businesses tend to require special supervision from public safety agencies of the City in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the residents of the City; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds that sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds that churches and schools are centers of family oriented activities; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds that sexually oriented commercial enterprises can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending churches or schools in the surrounding area; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds a concentration of sexually oriented commercial enterprises can contribute to a decline in the value of surrounding properties; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds that a concentration of sexually oriented commercial enterprises can contribute to an increase in criminal activities in surrounding areas; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds that the signs and exterior portions of sexually oriented commercial businesses, including but not limited to, adult bookstores, adult movie theaters and massage establishments can be detrimental to the mental health of minors viewing such signs and exterior portions; and 
    WHEREAS, Section 243.005 of the Local Government Code provides that premises holding alcoholic beverage permits and licenses may be included within the scope of the regulations adopted regarding sexually oriented businesses; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds that the sexually oriented businesses having alcoholic beverage licenses and permits exert the same influences on churches and schools, have the same effect on property values, and contribute in the same manner to criminal activities as do those which do not serve alcohol, and that they should be included in the scope of the regulations regarding sexually oriented businesses; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds that sexually oriented businesses exert the same influences on day care centers as on churches and schools, and that child care facilities should be afforded the same degree of land use protection; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission acknowledges that adult businesses should be located in particular areas; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission recognizes that adult businesses should not be located near churches, schools or within residential areas; and 
    WHEREAS, in order to protect the health and welfare of all residents within the City of Richmond, the City Commission has found it necessary to restrict the areas in which adult businesses shall be located.

(3)  It is the intent of this section to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residences.

(2)  For the purpose of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent or temporary residence to the nearest property line of the premises where children commonly gather, as described herein. 
(3)  Exceptions. A person residing within 1,000 feet of those places where children commonly gather, as specified herein does not commit a violation of this section if any of the following apply:

b.  The person was a minor, when he committed the offense and was not convicted as an adult. 
c.  The person is a minor. 
d.  The premises where children commonly gather, as specified herein, within 1,000 feet of the person's permanent or temporary residence was opened after the person established the permanent or temporary residence and complied with all sex offender registration laws of the state. 
(d)  Property owners prohibited from renting real property to sexual offenders. It is unlawful to let or rent any place, structure or part thereof, manufactured home, trailer, or other conveyance, with the knowledge that it will be used as a permanent residence or temporary residence by any person prohibited from establishing such permanent residence or temporary residence pursuant to the terms of this section, if such place, structure or part thereof, manufactured home, trailer, or other conveyance, is located within 1,000 feet of any premises where children commonly gather, including but not limited to, a school, day care facility, playground, public or private youth center, public swimming pool, or video arcade facility, as those terms are defined in V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code § 481.134. 
(e)  Length of time applicable. The length of time with which this section is applicable to an offender shall be as follows: 
(1)  A person assigned a risk level of one pursuant to Vernon's Ann C.C.P. art. 62.007 or has no risk assessment level assignment shall be exempt from this section upon the completion of that person's probationary period for the offense described in subsection (c)(1) of this section and this subsection (e), as applicable.

    WHEREAS, persons under the age of 18 years are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful and gang-related activities and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime; and 
    WHEREAS, the City of Richmond has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, for the enforcement of parental control of and responsibility for their children, for the protection for the general public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities; and

    Certificated telecommunications provider is as defined in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 283. 
    Facilities means any and all of the NCT provider's wires, cables, fibers, duct spaces, manholes, poles, conduits, underground and overhead passageways and other equipment, structures, plant and appurtenances and physical devices in, on or under the public rights-of-way.

    NCT provider means a non-certificated telecommunications provider that delivers telecommunications service within the city to any person with facilities that are in the public rights-of-way and, to the extent allowed by law, includes any person, other than a certificated telecommunications provider, that does not deliver telecommunications service within the city, but who places, constructs, or maintains facilities within the public rights-of-way for the delivering of telecommunications service outside the city. 
    Public rights-of-way means public rights-of-way as defined in the V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 283.002(6). This definition governs over any conflicting definition contained in this article. 
    Public rights-of-way use fee means the fee to be paid quarterly as determined in accordance with this division. 
    Telecommunications service means the providing or offering to provide transmissions between or among points identified by the user, of information of the user's choosing, including voice, video or data, without change in content of the information as sent and received, if the transmissions are accomplished through facilities placed in, on or over the public rights-of-way, expressly excluding cable services or open video systems as defined in Title VI of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and "wireless services" providers, as defined by law, and any service that may only be offered by certificated telecommunications providers. 
(Ord. No. 2000-11, § 3, 6-12-2000) 
Sec. 28-152. - Purpose and application. 
(a)  The purpose of this division is to establish an application and regulatory process for non-certificated telecommunications providers' (NCT providers) use and occupancy of the public rights-of-way and to compensate the city for the private, commercial use and occupancy of the public rights-of-way by NCT providers in a non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner. 
(b)  It is unlawful for any NCT provider to place any facilities or make use of the public rights-of-way without first obtaining a municipal consent as required by this division. This division does not apply to a person providing services solely by means of a wireless transmission or services provided by certificated telecommunications providers. 
(c)  A municipal consent granted under this division does not authorize any person to provide any services not covered by the municipal consent, including, but not limited to, cable service and open video systems as defined in Title VI of the Communications Act of 1934 (Title 47, Chapter 5, Subchapter V-A of the United States Code (47 USC 521 et seq.)).

    Any person wishing to obtain a municipal consent must submit an application on a form prescribed by the city along with a non-refundable application fee in the amount established in the city's schedule of fees and charges. If the application meets the requirements of this division, the city commission may grant a municipal consent by ordinance.

(2)  A charge per linear foot for each linear foot of facilities the NCT provider places in the public rights-of-way as established in the city's schedule of fees and charges. 
(3)  The minimum fee provided for in this section. 
(b)  Calculation of access line fee.

(d)  Reports on access lines. Subject to the city's agreement not to disclose this information unless required by law, the NCT provider shall provide quarterly or as requested by the city, within a reasonable time after receipt of the city's written request, a report showing the number of access lines being maintained or operated by the NCT provider that are serving premises within the city, on a month end basis. The city agrees that the report shall be used solely for the purposes of verifying the number of the NCT provider's access lines serving premises within the city. Upon written request, the NCT provider shall verify the information in the report and, upon reasonable advance notice, all non-customer specific records and other documents required for such verification shall be subject to inspection by the city, expressly excluding any records, documents or other writings, the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC 2701 et seq. 
(e)  Adjustment of other fees. Any fees imposed under this section, other than the access line fee, may be adjusted once every three years by the city, but the adjustment shall not exceed ten percent in any one three-year period. 
(f)  Minimum annual fee. If the public rights-of-way fee provided for in this section is less than the minimum amount established therefor in the city's schedule of fees and charges for any calendar year following the date of the municipal consent, the NCT provider shall pay the city the minimum fee established in such schedule for that year. 
(g)  Street crossing fee. In addition to all other fees, an NCT provider shall pay the city a street crossing fee in the amount established in the city's schedule of fees and charges for each instance where the NCT provider places facilities across a public right-of-way that contains a public street if the surface of the street is cut or excavated to install the facilities. The street crossing fee provided by this subsection does not apply if the facilities are placed by boring under the street and is accomplished without cutting or disturbing the surface of the street. The street crossing fee shall be paid for each street crossing that occurred in the applicable calendar quarter since the last quarterly payment was made. 
(h)  No other fees. The fees and payments provided for in this section are in lieu of any other construction, inspection, or similar fees or charges assessed by the city against any person for making use of or installing, reconstructing, or repairing facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(i)  Uncollected revenues. Any other provision of this agreement notwithstanding, an NCT provider shall not be obligated to pay the city for any access lines or private line termination points, the revenues for which remain uncollectible. 
(j)  Circumvention prohibited. An NCT provider may not circumvent payment of any fees payable hereunder or evade payment of such fees by bartering, transfer of rights, or by any other means.

Upon the city's written request, an NCT provider shall make its books and records that are relevant to compliance with the municipal consent available to the city to examine, audit, review and copy, in the city. 
(c)  Upon written request by the city, an NCT provider shall furnish to the city, within 30 business days from the date of the written request, copies of all public petitions, applications, written communications and reports submitted by the NCT provider, to the FCC or to the PUC or their successor agencies, to the extent they relate to any matters affecting the physical use of the public rights-of-way in the city.

The city's approval shall be based upon the transferee providing adequate information to the city that it has the ability to perform and comply with the obligations and requirements of the municipal consent. The approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Should an NCT provider sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests under its municipal consent without the city's prior consent, the city may revoke the NCT provider's municipal consent. Any transfer in violation of this section is unenforceable. 
(b)  Any change of control of an NCT provider shall constitute a transfer that requires the city's consent under this section. There is a rebuttable presumption of a change of control of an NCT provider upon a change of 25 percent or greater in the ownership of the NCT provider. 
(c)  A mortgage or other pledge of assets to a bank or lending institution in a bona fide lending transaction shall not be considered an assignment or transfer under this section.

(1)  Transfer or assign the facilities in the public rights-of-way under a municipal consent to another NCT provider who has a municipal consent under this article; 
(2)  Transfer or assign the municipal consent to an affiliate that is a certificated telecommunications provider; or 
(3)  Collaterally assign the municipal consent to its lender as security, and said lender may exercise its security interest and transfer the municipal consent to a third party that is a certificated telecommunications provider.

(b)  Termination. The city may terminate any PRWUA for a breach of the PRWUA or of this article, subject to a 30-day written notice and the opportunity to cure the breach during that 30-day period. A termination may be declared only by a written decision of the city commission after an appropriate public proceeding before the city commission, which will accord the provider due process and full opportunity to be heard and to respond to any notice of grounds to terminate. All notice requirements will be met by giving the provider at least 15 days' prior written notice of any public hearing concerning the proposed termination of its PRWUA. The notice must state the grounds for termination alleged by the city. If the provider fails to make any payment to the city for use of the right-of-way as required by this division in three successive quarters, the city may terminate the PRWUA notwithstanding that the provider cures the default within 30 days of the city's notice of the default.

(Ord. No. 2009-07, § 1, 2-16-2009) 
Editor's note- The recitals found in the preamble to Ordinance No. 2009-07 read as follows: 
    WHEREAS, Federal Trade Commission adopted rules pertaining to an Identity Theft Prevention pursuant to the Red Flags Rule which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 which requires that creditors adopt an Identity Theft Prevention Program on or before May 1, 2009; and 
    WHEREAS, the Red Flags Rule defines creditor to include all utility companies and the City owns and provides utility services and/or accepts payments for municipal utility services and is therefore classified as a creditor; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission has requested City personnel to develop such Identity Theft Prevention Program and such personnel recommend the Identity Theft Prevention Program attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit "A" ("Program"); and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission has reviewed the Program and believes it fulfills, complies and implements the Red Flags Rule and other requirements outlined by the Federal Trade Commission; and 
    WHEREAS, the City Commission finds that it is in the public interest to adopt the Program. 
Sec. 34-20. - Program adoption. 
    The city developed this identity theft prevention program ("program") pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Red Flags Rule ("rule"), which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, 16 CFR 681.2. This program was developed for the utility department of the city ("utility") with oversight and approval of the city commission. After consideration of the size and complexity of the utility's operations and account systems, and the nature and scope of the utility's activities, the city commission determined that this program was appropriate for the city's utility, and therefore approved this program on February 17, 2009. 
(Ord. No. 2009-07, exh. A(I), 2-16-2009) 
Sec. 34-21. - Purpose and definitions. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to: 
(1)  Establish an identity theft prevention program. 
(2)  Establish an identity theft prevention program designed to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or an existing covered account and to provide for continued administration of the Program in compliance with Part 681 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations implementing Sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) of 2003. 
(b)  The following provisions apply to establishing and fulfilling requirements of the Red Flags Rule: 
(1)  The Red Flags Rule (rule) defines "identity theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person" and a "red flag" (red flag) as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft. 
(2)  Under the rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its operation. The program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to: 
a.  Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; 
b.  Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; 
c.  Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 
d.  Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft. 
(c)  The following are Red Flags Rule definitions used in this program. 
    Covered account, under the rule, means: 
(1)  Any account the utility offers or maintains primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions; and 
(2)  Any other account the utility offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the utility from identity theft. 
    Creditors, as defined under the rule, means and includes finance companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and telecommunications companies. Where non-profit and government entities defer payment for goods or services, they, too, are to be considered creditors." 
    Identifying information, as defined under the rule, means any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person, including: name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, computer's Internet protocol address, or routing code. 
    Program means the identity theft prevention program for the city. 
    Program administrator means the customer service supervisor who is the program administrator for the program. 
    Utility means the customer service department for the city. 
(Ord. No. 2009-07, exh. A(II), 2-16-2009) 
Sec. 34-22. - Identification of red flags. 
    In order to identify relevant red flags, the utility considers the types of accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous experiences with identity theft. The utility identifies the following red flags, in each of the listed categories: 
(1)  Notifications and warnings from consumer credit reporting agencies. Red flags include: 
a.  Report of fraud accompanying a consumer credit report; 
b.  Notice or report from a consumer credit agency of a credit freeze on a customer or applicant; 
c.  Notice or report from a consumer credit agency of an active duty alert for an applicant; and 
d.  Indication from a consumer credit report of activity that is inconsistent with a customer's usual pattern or activity, including but not limited to: 
1.  Recent and significant increase in volume of inquiries; 
2.  Unusual number of recent credit applications; 
3.  A material change in use of credit; 
4.  Accounts closed for cause or abuse. 
(2)  Suspicious documents. Red flags include: 
a.  Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered or inauthentic; 
b.  Identification document or card on which a person's photograph or physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document; 
c.  Other document with information that is not consistent with existing customer information (such as if a person's signature on a check appears forged); and 
d.  Application for service that appears to have been altered or forged. 
(3)  Suspicious personal identifying information. Red flags include: 
a.  Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other information the customer provides (example: inconsistent birth dates, lack of correlation between social security number range and date of birth); 
b.  Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other sources of information (for instance, social security number or an address not matching an address on a credit report); 
c.  Identifying information presented that is the same as information shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent; 
d.  Identifying information presented that is consistent with fraudulent activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing address); 
e.  Social security number presented that is the same as one given by another customer; 
f.  An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of another person; 
g.  A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law, social security numbers must not be required) or an applicant cannot provide information requested beyond what could commonly be found in a purse or wallet; and 
h.  A person's identifying information is not consistent with the information that is on file for the customer. 
(4)  Suspicious account activity or unusual use of account. Red flags include: 
a.  Change of address for an account followed by a request to change the account holder's name; 
b.  Payments stop on an otherwise consistently up-to-date account; 
c.  Account used in a way that is not consistent with prior use (example: very high activity); 
d.  Mail sent to the account holder is repeatedly returned as undeliverable; 
e.  Notice to the utility that a customer is not receiving mail sent by the utility; 
f.  Notice to the utility that an account has unauthorized activity; 
g.  Breach in the utility's computer system security; and 
h.  Unauthorized access to or use of customer account information. 
(5)  Alerts from others. Red flags include notice to the utility from a customer, identity theft victim, fraud detection service, law enforcement or other person that it has opened or is maintaining a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft. 
(Ord. No. 2009-07, exh. A(III), 2-16-2009) 
Sec. 34-23. - Detecting red flags. 
(a)  New accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified in section 34-22 associated with the opening of a new account, utility personnel will take the following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the account: 
(1)  Require certain identifying information such as name, date of birth, residential or business address, principal place of business for an entity, driver's license or other identification; 
(2)  Verify the customer's identity (for instance, review a driver's license or other identification card); 
(3)  Review documentation showing the existence of a business entity; 
(4)  Request additional documentation to establish identity; and 
(5)  Independently contact the customer or business. 
(b)  Existing accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified in section 34-22 for an existing account, utility personnel will take the following steps to monitor transactions with an account: 
(1)  Verify the identification of customers if they request information (in person, via telephone, via facsimile, via email); 
(2)  Verify the validity of requests to close accounts or change billing addresses; and 
(3)  Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2009-07, exh. A(IV), 2-16-2009) 
Sec. 34-24. - Preventing and mitigating identity theft; protecting customer identifying information. 
(a)  Prevent and mitigate. In the event utility personnel detect any identified red flags, such personnel shall take one or more of the following steps, depending on the degree of risk posed by the red flag: 
(1)  Continue to monitor an account for evidence of identity theft; 
(2)  Contact the customer, sometimes through multiple methods; 
(3)  Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access to accounts; 
(4)  Not open a new account; 
(5)  Close an existing account; 
(6)  Do not close the account, but monitor or contact authorities; 
(7)  Reopen an account with a new number; 
(8)  Notify the program administrator for determination of the appropriate step(s) to take; 
(9)  Notify law enforcement; or 
(10)  Determine that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances. 
(b)  Protect customer identifying information. In order to further prevent the likelihood of identity theft occurring with respect to utility accounts, the utility will take the following steps with respect to its internal operating procedures to protect customer identifying information: 
(1)  Ensure that its website is secure or provide clear notice that the website is not secure; 
(2)  Where and when allowed, ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and computer files containing customer information; 
(3)  Ensure that office computers are password protected and that computer screens lock after a set period of time; 
(4)  Change passwords on office computers on a regular basis; 
(5)  Ensure all computers are backed up properly and any backup information is secured; 
(6)  Keep offices clear of papers containing customer information; 
(7)  Request only the last four digits of social security numbers (if any); 
(8)  Ensure computer virus protection is up to date; and 
(9)  Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that are necessary for utility purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2009-07, exh. A(V), 2-16-2009) 
Sec. 34-25. - Program updates. 
    This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the utility from identity theft. At least annually, the program administrator will consider the utility's experiences with identity theft situation, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts the utility maintains and changes in the utility's business arrangements with other entities, consult with law enforcement authorities, and consult with other city personnel. After considering these factors, the program administrator will determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the program administrator will update the program or present the city commission with his recommended changes and the city commission will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the program. 
(Ord. No. 2009-07, exh. A(VI), 2-16-2009) 
Sec. 34-26. - Program administration. 
(a)  Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies with an identity theft committee for the utility. The committee is headed by a program administrator who may be the head of the utility or his appointee. Two or more other individuals appointed by the head of the utility or the program administrator comprise the remainder of the committee membership. The program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of utility staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program. 
(b)  Staff training and reports. 
(1)  Initially, all utility staff shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected. Thereafter, all utility staff shall undergo update training not less than annually. Additionally, all new utility employees shall undergo training. 
(2)  All utility staff shall submit reports monthly concerning the utility's compliance with the program, the training that has been given and the effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft, including recommendations for changes to the program. While incidents of identity theft are to be reported immediately to the program administrator, the monthly reports shall contain a recap of the incident and include the steps taken to assist with resolution of the incident. 
(c)  Service provider arrangements. In the event the utility engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, including, but not limited to, franchise utility providers, the utility will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft: 
(1)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and 
(2)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers review the utility's program and report any red flags to the program administrator. 
(d)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the Red Flags Rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the utility's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices is limited to the identity theft committee and those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

(Ord. No. 95-16, 11-13-1995) 
Editor's note- The preamble to Ordinance No. 95-16 reads as follows: 
    WHEREAS, Congress has, through the Environmental Protection Agency, established national standards for safe drinking water; and 
    WHEREAS, the Texas Legislature has determined that the unrestricted cross-connection of a public water supply and that of any other water supply is a serious public health risk as evidenced by Section 341.033 of Texas Health and Safety Code; and 
    WHEREAS, Section 402.001 of Texas Local Government Code empowers a municipality to prescribe kinds of water mains that may be used inside or outside the municipality, to inspect those facilities and appliances, to require that they be kept in good condition at all times, and to prescribe the necessary rules, which may include penalties, concerning them; and 
    WHEREAS, in order to protect the health and welfare of all residents within the City of Richmond by protecting the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through water service connections, the City Commission has found it necessary to establish cross-connection control. 
Sec. 34-88. - General policy. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is: 
(1)  To protect the public potable water supply of the city from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the consumer's internal distribution system or the consumer's private water system such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow into the public water systems; 
(2)  To promote the elimination or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the consumer's in-plant potable water system and non-potable water system, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and 
(3)  To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems. 
(b)  Responsibility. The city water department shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said city water department an approved backflow prevention assembly is required (at the consumer's water service connection or within the consumer's private water system) for the safety of the water system, the city water department or their designated agent shall give notice in writing to said consumer to install such an approved backflow prevention assembly at a specific location on his premises. The consumer shall immediately install such an approved backflow prevention assembly at the consumer's own expense; and, failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install, have tested and maintained said assembly, shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met.

a.  The water purveyor's system; and 
b.  The consumer's system. 
(2)  The water purveyor's system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system; and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the purveyor, up to the point where the consumer's system begins. 
(3)  The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution system. 
(4)  The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the consumer's system. 
(5)  The consumer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the water purveyor's distribution system which are utilized in conveying potable water to points of use. 
(b)  Policy. The following policies shall apply to this article: 
(1)  No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by city laws and regulations and this article. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly required by this article is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed, by-passed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. 
(2)  The consumer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city plumbing inspector and with the assistance of water department personnel to determine whether unprotected cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the city water department shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the consumer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with the city ordinances relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
(3)  An approved backflow prevention assembly shall also be installed on each service line to a consumer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist: 
a.  In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the city water department, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
b.  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the water purveyor's system which have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
c.  In the case of premises having: 
1.  Internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected or protected against; or 
2.  Intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist; 
the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line. 
(4)  The type of protective assembly required under subsection (b)(3)a, b, and c of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows: 
a.  In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection (b)(3)a of this section and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. 
b.  In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve backflow prevention assembly.

per Household Gallons per Month 1 or 2 6,000 3 or 4 7,000 4 or 5 8,000 5 or 6 9,000 7 or 8 10,000 9 or 10 12,000  
(1)  The term "household" means the residential premises served by the customer's meter. The term "persons per household" includes only those persons currently physically residing at the premises and expected to reside there for the entire billing period. It shall be assumed that a particular customer's household is comprised of two persons unless the customer notifies the city water department of a greater number of persons per household on a form prescribed by the city manager or the city manager's designee. The city manager or the city manager's designee shall give their best effort to see that such forms are mailed, otherwise provided, or made available to every residential customer. If, however, a customer does not receive such a form, it shall be the customer's responsibility to go to the city water department offices to complete and sign the form claiming more than two persons per household. New customers may claim more persons per household at the time of applying for water service on the form prescribed by the city manager or the city manager's designee. When the number of persons per household increases so as to place the customer in a different allocation category, the customer may notify the city water department on such form and the change will be implemented in the next practicable billing period. If the number of persons in a household is reduced, the customer shall notify the city water department in writing within two days. In prescribing the method for claiming more than two persons per household, the city manager or the city manager's designee shall adopt methods to ensure the accuracy of the claim. Any person who knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence falsely reports the number of persons in a household or fails to timely notify the city water department of a reduction in the number of persons in a household is guilty of a Class C misdemeanor and upon conviction is punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.00. 
(2)  Residential water customers shall pay the following surcharges: 
$50.00 for the first 1,000 gallons over allocation. 
$75.00 for the second 1,000 gallons over allocation.

(3)  Surcharges shall be cumulative. 
(b)  Master-metered multifamily residential customer. 
(1)  The allocation to a customer billed from a master meter which jointly measures water to multiple permanent residential dwelling units (e.g., apartments, mobile homes) shall be allocated 6,000 gallons per month for each dwelling unit. It shall be assumed that such a customer's meter serves two dwelling units unless the customer notifies the city water department of a greater number on a form prescribed by the city manager or the city manager's designee. It shall be the customer's responsibility to go to the city water department offices to complete and sign the form claiming more than two dwellings. A dwelling unit may be claimed under these provisions whether it is occupied or not. New customers may claim more dwelling units at the time of applying for water on the form prescribed by the city manager or the city manager's designee. If the number of dwelling units served by a master meter is reduced, the customer shall notify the city water department in writing within two days. In prescribing the method for claiming more than two dwelling units, the city's designee shall adopt methods to ensure the accuracy of the claim. Any person who knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence falsely reports the number of dwelling units served by a master meter or fails to timely notify the city water department of a reduction in the number of persons in a household is guilty of a Class C misdemeanor and upon conviction is punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.00. 
(2)  Customers billed from a master meter under this provision shall pay the following monthly surcharges: 
$100.00 for 1,000 gallons over the allocation up through 1,000 gallons for each dwelling unit. 
$150.00 thereafter, for each additional 1,000 gallons over allocation up through a second 1,000 gallons for each dwelling unit. 
$200.00 thereafter, for each additional 1,000 gallons over allocation up through a third 1,000 gallons for each dwelling unit. 
$250.00 thereafter, for each additional 1,000 gallons above the third 1,000 gallons over allocation. 
(3)  Surcharges shall be cumulative. 
(c)  Commercial customers. 
(1)  A monthly water usage allocation shall be made by the city mayor or mayor's designee for each nonresidential commercial customer who uses water for processing purposes. The nonresidential customer's allocation shall be approximately 75 percent of the customer's usage for corresponding month's billing period for the previous 12 months. If the customer's billing history is shorter than 12 months, the monthly average for the period for which there is a record shall be used for any monthly period for which no history exists. Provided, however, a customer, 75 percent of whose monthly usage is less than 1,000 gallons, shall be allocated 1,000 gallons. The city manager shall give the city manager's best effort to see that notice of each nonresidential customer's allocation is mailed to such a customer. If, however, a customer does not receive such notice, it shall be the customer's responsibility to contact the city water department to determine the allocation. Upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the city manager, the allocation may be reduced or increased if (1) the designated period does not accurately reflect the customer's normal water usage; (2) one nonresidential customer agrees to transfer part of its allocation to another nonresidential customer; or (3) other objective evidence demonstrates that the designated allocation is inaccurate under present conditions. A customer may appeal an allocation established hereunder to the city commission. 
(2)  Nonresidential commercial customers shall pay the following surcharges: 
a.  Customers whose allocation is 1,000 gallons through 500,000 gallons per month:

b.  Customers whose allocation is 500,000 gallons per month or more: 
1.5 times the block rate for each 1,000 gallons in excess of the allocation up through 5 percent above allocation. 
2.0 times the block rate for each 1,000 gallons from 5 percent through 10 percent above allocation. 
2.5 times the block rate for each 1,000 gallons from 10 percent through 15 percent above allocation. 
3.0 times the block rate for each 1,000 gallons more than 15 percent above allocation. 
(d)  Industrial customers. 
(1)  A monthly water usage allocation shall be established by the city mayor or mayor's designee for each industrial customer, which uses water for processing purposes. The industrial customer's allocation shall be approximately 75 percent of the customer's water usage baseline. Ninety days after the initial imposition of the allocation for industrial customers, the industrial customer's allocation shall be further reduced to 50 percent of the customer's water usage baseline. The industrial customer's water usage baseline will be computed on the average water usage for the 12-month period ending prior to the date of implementation of Stage 2 of the plan. If the industrial water customer's billing history is shorter than 12 months, the monthly average for the period for which there is a record shall be used for any monthly period for which no billing history exists. The city manager shall give city manager's best effort to see that notice of each industrial customers allocation is mailed to such customer. If, however, a customer does not receive such notice, it shall be the customer's responsibility to contact the city water department to determine the allocation, and the allocation shall be fully effective notwithstanding the lack of receipt of written notice. Upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the city water department, the allocation may be reduced or increased, if: 
a.  The designated period does not accurately reflect the customer's normal water usage because the customer had shutdown a major processing unit for repair or overhaul during the period; 
b.  The customer has added or is in the process of adding significant additional processing capacity; 
c.  The customer has shutdown or significantly reduced the production of a major processing unit; 
d.  The customer has previously implemented significant permanent water conservation measures such that the ability to further reduce usage is limited; 
e.  The customer agrees to transfer part of its allocation to another industrial customer; or 
f.  If other objective evidence demonstrates that the designated allocation is inaccurate under present conditions. 
A customer may appeal an allocation established hereunder to the city commission. 
(2)  Industrial customers shall pay the following surcharges: 
a.  Customers whose allocation is 1,000 gallons through 100,000 gallons per month: 
$150.00 per thousand gallons for the first 1,000 gallons over allocation.

$350.00 per thousand gallons for the third 1,000 gallons over allocation. 
$450.00 per thousand gallons for each additional 1,000 gallons above the third 1,000 gallons over allocation. 
b.  Customers whose allocation is 100,000 gallons per month or more: 
1.5 times the block rate for each 1,000 gallons in excess of the allocation up through five percent above allocation. 
2.0 times the block rate for each 1,000 gallons from five percent through ten percent above allocation. 
2.5 times the block rate for each 1,000 gallons from 10 percent through 15 percent above allocation. 
3.0 times the block rate for each 1,000 gallons more than 15 percent above allocation. 
(3)  The surcharges shall be cumulative. 
(e)  As used in this section, the term "block rate" means the charge to the customer per 1,000 gallons at the regular water rate schedule at the level of the customer's allocation.

(c)  Any person, including a person classified as a water customer of the city water department, in apparent control of the property where a violation occurs or originates shall be presumed to be the violator, and proof that the violation occurred on the person's property shall constitute a rebuttal presumption that the person in apparent control of the property committed the violation, but any such person shall have the right to show that said person did not commit the violation. Parents shall be presumed to be responsible for violations of their minor children and proof that a violation, committed by a child, occurred on property within the parents control shall constitute a rebuttal presumption that the parent committed the violation, but any such parent may be excused if such parent proves that they had previously directed the child not to use the water as it was used in violation of this plan and that the parent could not have reasonably known of the violation. 
(d)  Any employee of the city, police officer, or code enforcement officer designated by the city mayor or the mayor's designee, may issue a citation to a person the officer reasonably believes to be in violation of this division. The citation shall be prepared in duplicate and shall contain the name and address of the alleged violator, if known, the offense charged, and shall direct the alleged violator to appear in the city municipal court on the date shown on the citation for which the date shall not be less than three days nor more than five days from the date the citation was issued. The alleged violator shall be served a copy of the citation. Service of the citation shall be complete upon delivery of the citation to the alleged violator, to an agent or employee of a violator, or to a person over 14 years of age who is a member of the violator's immediate family or is a resident of the violator's residence. The alleged violator shall appear in city municipal court to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty for the violation of this plan. If the alleged violator fails to appear in city municipal court, a warrant for the alleged violator's arrest may be issued. A summon to appear may be issued in lieu of an arrest warrant. These cases shall be expedited and given preferential setting in city municipal court before all other cases.

Chapter 115 - SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL 

Sec. 115-1. - Purpose; intent. 
(a)  During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. 
(b)  As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the city. This chapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the city.

    Control plan means a plan indicating the specific measures and sequencing to be used to control sediment and erosion on a development site during and after construction. 
    Drainage way means any channel that conveys surface runoff throughout the site. 
    Erosion and sediment means a set of plans prepared by or under the direction of a licensed professional engineer. 
    Erosion control means a measure that prevents erosion. 
    Grading means excavation or fill of material, including the resulting conditions thereof. 
    Perimeter control means a barrier that prevents sediment from leaving a site by filtering sediment-laden runoff or diverting it to a sediment trap or basin. 
    Permit means improvements and structures for the control of erosion, runoff, and grading. 
    Phasing means clearing a parcel of land in distinct phases, with the stabilization of each phase completed before the clearing of the next. 
    Sediment control means measures that prevent eroded sediment from leaving the site. 
    Site means a parcel of land or a contiguous combination thereof where grading work is performed as a single unified operation. 
    Site development means a permit issued by the municipality for the construction or alteration of ground. 
    Stabilization means the use of practices that prevent exposed soil from eroding. 
    Start of construction means the first land-disturbing activity associated with a development, including land preparation such as clearing, grading, and filling; installation of streets and walkways; excavation for basements, footings, piers, or foundations; erection of temporary forms; and installation of accessory buildings such as garages. 
    Watercourse means a public or private permanent or intermittent stream or other body of water, either natural or manmade, which gathers or carries surface water. 
    Waterway means a channel that directs surface runoff to a watercourse or to the public storm drain.

A. Generally. It is the intent of the City Commission to respect the property rights of existing or pending development
approvals and development as set out in this Section.
B. Effect on Existing Ordinances. The City's existing ordinances, unless expressly repealed or amended by this UDC, or
by some other City Commission action, will remain in effect; provided, however, that where this UDC is more
restrictive or where it includes additional provisions (including those that are inconsistent or in conflict with existing
ordinances) then the City will enforce this UDC as set out in Section 1.2.103, Conflicting Provisions.
C. Effect on Pending Applications.
1. Except as provided in Subsection C.2., below, each application for development approval shall be evaluated by
the regulations that were in effect at the time the complete application was submitted.
2. Applications for development approval that were not pursued with due diligence may expire pursuant to Section
6.3.211, Stale Applications.
D. Effect on Development Approvals or Agreements that Predate the Effective Date.

that is approved or for which there is an executed agreement may be carried out within the scope of that
development approval or agreement, including applicable standards in effect at the time of the approval or
agreement, provided that the approval or agreement is valid and has not lapsed, as set out in Section 6.3.211,
Stale Application, or other applicable provisions of this UDC, or in the agreement itself.
2. Development approvals that are valid on the effective date of this UDC, are valid for the duration specified in or

pursuant to this UDC, the City does not enforce private restrictions and only will enforce its own regulations.
3. The City will not interpret or apply private restrictions unless it is a party to them.
4. To the extent that the City is made aware of private restrictions:

City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 7
provisions is at the sole discretion of the parties to the private restrictions (or any other party who has
standing to bring suit under Texas law).
b. If the private restrictions are less restrictive than the provisions of this UDC or other provisions of the City's
existing ordinances, then the City will only enforce the provisions of this UDC and existing ordinances.
Sec. 1.2.102 Severability
A. Generally. If any Chapter, Article, Division, Section, Subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of this UDC is
held unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this UDC shall not be affected.
If any application of this UDC to a particular use, building, structure, land, subdivision, or water is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not be applicable to any other
use, building, structure, land, subdivision, or water not specifically included in said judgment.
B. Signs. With respect to Article 4.7, Signs, and any Section, Subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of this
UDC which explicitly addresses signs, the following severability provisions shall apply:
1. Severability Generally. If any Section, Subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of Article 4.7, Signs, or
any other provision of this UDC related to the construction, maintenance, or display of signs, is declared
unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such
unconstitutionality shall not affect any other Section, Subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of
Article 4.7, Signs, or this UDC.
2. Severability Where Less Speech Results. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability
set out in Subsection B.1., above, or elsewhere in this Section, this UDC, or any adopting ordinance, if any
Section, Subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of Article 4.7, Signs, or any other provision of this
UDC related to the construction, maintenance, or display of signs, is declared unconstitutional by the valid
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not
affect any other Section, Subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of Article 4.7, Signs, or this UDC,
even if such severability would result in a situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting
previously exempt signs to permitting or otherwise.
3. Severability of Provisions Pertaining to Prohibited Signs and Sign Elements. Without diminishing or limiting in any
way the declaration of severability set out in Subsection B.1., and Subsection B.2., above, if any Section,
Subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of Article 4.7, Signs, or any other provision of this UDC
related to the construction, maintenance, or display of signs, is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment
or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any
other Section, Subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of Article 4.7, Signs, or any other provision of
this UDC that pertains to prohibited signs or sign elements. It is the intent of the City Commission to ensure that
as many prohibited sign types and sign elements as may be constitutionally prohibited continue to be prohibited.
4. Severability of Provisions if Adjudicated Stricken Due to a Content-Basis. It is the intent of the City Commission to
regulate signage in a manner that implements the purposes of Article 4.7, Signs, as expressed in Section 4.7.101,
Purpose and Application. The City finds that the purposes stated in Section 4.7.101, Purpose and Application, are
legitimate, substantial, and compelling public interests, that the regulation of signage in Article 4.7, Signs, is
unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and that the incidental restrictions on expression that may occur
as a result of these regulations is no more than is essential to the furtherance of the public interests. However, if
a court of competent jurisdiction finds any regulation to be based upon content and, further, declares such
regulation unconstitutional, then it is the intent of the City Commission that only that portion of the provision
that is found to relate to content be severed from this UDC, and if it is not possible for the court to strike only the
portion of the provision that is found to relate to content, then it is the intent of the City Commission that all
signs that would be subject to the stricken provision will instead be subject to the next surviving provision for a
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 8
sign of like geometry and character that is more restrictive than the stricken provision in terms of, in descending
order of priority:
a. sign height; and
b. sign area.
Sec. 1.2.103 Conflicting Provisions
A. Generally. In the event that the provisions of this UDC conflict with each other or with other City ordinances:
1. The more restrictive provision shall control, if the provisions were adopted at the same time; or
2. The more recent provision shall control if the provisions were adopted at different times.
B. State and Federal Law. No part of this UDC relieves any applicant from compliance with applicable provisions of
state or federal law. If a use, building, structure, operational characteristic, construction technique, environmental
impact, or other matter is prohibited by state or federal law, it is also prohibited in the City. Likewise, if a matter is
regulated by state or federal law, then compliance with state or federal law does not relieve the applicant from
compliance with this UDC, unless the application of this UDC is legally preempted.
Sec. 1.2.104 Repealer
A. Generally. The City Commission finds that the adoption of this UDC necessitates the repeal of all conflicting
ordinances that existed on the effective date.
B. Repealed Ordinances. The following duly adopted ordinances of the City of Richmond, Texas, that existed on the
effective date prior to the initial adoption of this UDC are hereby repealed:
1. Ord. No. 2011-10, Manufactured Home Ordinances;

Table 2.1.101A
Zoning Districts Established
District
Classification
District
Name Symbol District Purpose
Suburban
Residential SR The purpose of the Suburban Residential district is to provide for the development, and
sometimes preservation, of residential neighborhoods with suburban character.
Residential
General
Residential GR The purpose of the General Residential district is to provide for the development, and
sometimes preservation, of residential neighborhoods with auto-urban character.
Suburban
Commercial SC
The purpose of the Suburban Commercial district is to provide for the development of
neighborhood convenience uses with suburban character, where the building and site
design standards ensure appropriately scaled commercial uses that are compatible and
cohesive with abutting and nearby residential uses.
General
Commercial GC The purpose of the General Commercial district is to provide for general commercial uses.
It is the primary retail and service district and is generally auto-urban in character.
Olde Town OT
The purpose of the Olde Town district is to preserve the traditional (and sometimes
historic), older areas of the City. This area exists on a gridded street pattern with a mix of
historic residential houses, houses that have been converted to nonresidential uses (e.g.,
law offices), and public / institutional, civic uses. Development within the Old Town district
allows a mix of uses while preserving the traditional "olde town" character of the City.
Downtown DN
The purpose of the Downtown district is to provide for commercial and mixed-use
development within the City's original central business district. Development within the
Downtown district is urban in character (i.e., buildings are built to the street and parking is
generally provided on-street or in public or private parking lots or parking structures.
Business
Park BP
The purpose of the Business Park district is to provide for the development of office and
lighter industrial uses with auto-urban character. These uses are generally categorized by
enhanced site and building standards (e.g., operations are conducted indoors with limited
on-site storage or truck traffic, limited or negligible external effects or nuisances, etc.) to
create a higher quality industrial parks or employment centers.
Industrial IN
The purpose of the Industrial district is to provide for the development of a range of
industrial enterprises with auto-urban character. These uses may include such things as
manufacturing, fabrication, and/or warehousing with both indoor and outdoor operations,
on-site storage and display, and may have heavy truck traffic.
Nonresidential
(including
mixed-use and
public uses)
Mixed-Use MU The purpose of the Mixed-Use district is to provide for the development of higher density
residential housing horizontally or vertically mixed with commercial or other

nonresidential uses (e.g., public / institutional uses). The Mixed-Use district anticipates an
urban character of development that is highly walkable and where large expanses of
parking are not visible from the street. In addition, these areas should be buffered from,
yet may be connected to, abutting residential and other uses.
Public /
Institutional PI
The purpose of the Public / Institutional district is to provide for public-owned and
operated uses (e.g., governmental and school buildings and facilities, utility stations,
libraries, cemeteries, active and passive recreation parks, public safety complexes, post
offices, etc.). These uses are oftentimes unique in nature and scale and thus, not
appropriately placed within any other district. Some of these uses may be appropriate in
other zoning districts subject to applicable performance standards.
RV Park RV
The purpose of the RV Park district is to provide housing and amenities for the
development of property where people with recreational vehicles can stay in spaces. This
district provides for the orderly development of property for use with recreational vehicles
and appropriate amenities by taking into consideration existing conditions, future land use
needs, and the availability of infrastructure.
C. Zoning of Annexed Land. Generally, if land is annexed from Fort Bend County, Texas into the City, it shall be zoned in
accordance with the Future Land Use Plan as set out in the City's Comprehensive Master Plan. Property owners may
petition the City for rezoning of the property in accordance with Section 6.3.405, Rezonings. Simultaneous
processing of the annexation and the zoning change is permitted.
D. Comprehensive Master Plan Consistency. The zoning districts created by this UDC are intended to implement the
City's Comprehensive Master Plan, which may be amended from time to time. When a lot or parcel is zoned in a
manner that is consistent with the City's Comprehensive Master Plan, then the City Commission may find that
approvals granted pursuant to the standards of this UDC are consistent with the intent of this adopted plan.
(Ord. No. 2018-02, 07/16/2018)
Effective on: 7/16/2018
Sec. 2.1.102 Official Zoning Map
A. Generally. Zoning districts are shown on the map entitled "official zoning map" of the City, which is attached hereto
and made part of this UDC. At least two copies of the official zoning map are on file and available for inspection
during regular business hours at City Hall.
B. Force and Effect. The official zoning map, together with all legends, references, symbols, boundaries, and other
information, shall be adopted as a part of, and concurrent with this UDC.
C. Effective Date. The effective date of a rezoning ordinance shall be the date specified in the ordinance itself, and not
the date of revision of the official zoning map.
D. Status of the Zoning Map. The official zoning map that is on file at the Department shall control in the event of a
conflict between the map that is on file and any other reproduction of the official zoning map.
E. Interpreting the Zoning Map. Where the official zoning map appears to be unclear regarding the location of district
boundaries, the Code Official shall make a determination using the following criteria:
1. Rights-of-Way or Easements. Where boundary lines appear to follow existing streets, alleys, railroad tracks,
utility lines, or similar features, the zoning boundary shall be construed to follow the center line of the rights-ofCity
of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 11
way or easement. Where the location of these features on the ground differs from that shown on the official
zoning map, the features on the ground control.
2. Corporate Limits. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following corporate limits, such
corporate limits shall be considered the district boundaries.
3. Property Lines. Where the boundaries are indicated as approximately following property or other lot lines, such
lines shall be construed to be the boundaries.
4. Watercourses. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, the centerline of drainageways,
streams, waterbodies, or other watercourses, shall be construed as following the channel centerline. In the event
of a natural change in the location of such streams or other watercourses, the zoning district boundary shall be
construed as moving with the channel centerline.
5. Unsubdivided Land or No Identifiable Feature. On unsubdivided land, or where a district boundary follows no
identifiable feature, the location of the boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions, shall be
determined by applying, in order, the following rules:
a. Legal Description. The boundary shall be according to the legal description in the ordinance establishing the
district boundaries.
b. Text Dimensions. The boundary shall be located by reference to dimensions shown in the text on the official
zoning map, if any.
c. Map Scale. The boundary shall be located using the map scale appearing on the official zoning map.
Sec. 2.1.103 Historic Overlay District

resources;
5. Promote economic prosperity and welfare of the community by encouraging the most appropriate use of historic
properties within the City; and
6. Encourage stabilization, restoration, and improvements of such properties and their values by offering incentives
for rehabilitation.
B. Applicability. All new development, redevelopment, and substantial improvement of buildings and structures shall
be designed and conform, insofar as possible, to the standards set out in Section 5.1.301, Historic Overlay District
Design Standards, and other applicable standards of this UDC.
C. Review. All development, redevelopment, and substantial improvement of buildings and structures within the
Historic Overlay District shall be reviewed by the Historic Preservation Officer (see Section 6.2.204, Historic
Preservation Officer), the Historic District Commission (see Section 6.2.104, Historic District Commission), the Code
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 12
Official (see Section 6.2.201, Code Official), and other members of the Development Review Committee (see Section
6.2.203, Development Review Committee) as may be necessary or required by this UDC.

proposed wireless telecommunication facility.
3. Elevation Drawings. Elevation drawings of the proposed facility showing all antennas, towers, tower heights,
structures, existing buildings, walls and/or roofs on which antennas are mounted, equipment buildings/cabinets,
fencing, screening, lighting, and other improvements related to the facility showing specific materials, placement
and colors.
4. Technical Report. A narrative report describing the facility and the technical, economic, and other reasons for its
design and location, the need for the facility and its role in the network, and describing the capacity of the
structure, including the number and type of antennas it can accommodate.
5. Coverage Map. A coverage map and a survey of existing towers including type and location and a statement to
demonstrate the need for the new tower and supporting documentation as to why co-location is not possible on
an existing tower in the area.

7. Removal Statement. A letter of intent to remove the facility at the expense of the facility operator and/or
property owner if it is abandoned.
F. Waiver of Co-Location Requirements. Upon request of the applicant, the development review body with jurisdiction
may waive the requirement that new support structures accommodate the co-location of other service providers if
co-location at the site is found to be non-essential to the public interest, that the construction of a shorter support
structure with fewer antennae will promote community compatibility, or that co-location would cause interference
with existing telecommunications facilities, as demonstrated by submitted technical evidence.
G. Time Limits. The development review body having jurisdiction shall act within a reasonable period of time to review
and recommend requests to place, construct, or modify telecommunications facilities after an application is filed.
Unless otherwise agreed between the City and the applicant or provided by state or federal law, reasonable review
and action by the City shall take no more than:
1. 90 days for wireless co-location applications, and

CHAPTER 3 DENSITY, INTENSITY, LOT, AND SCALE
ARTICLE 3.1 DENSITY, INTENSITY, LOT, AND SCALE STANDARDS
Division 3.1.100 Residential Density, Lot, and Scale Standards
Sec. 3.1.101 New Residential Development
A. Generally. The minimum lot size, minimum open space ratio (OSR), maximum gross density, minimum area of
development, and utility requirements for each residential district and neighborhood type are as set out in Table
3.1.101, Residential Development Standards.
B. Application. These standards apply to:
1. All subdivisions that meet the minimum area of development, as applicable;
2. Re-subdivisions of property that create two or more buildable lots; or
3. Single-family attached or multi-family developments with two or more dwelling units on a single parcel.
C. Neighborhood Types. New residential and predominantly residential mixed-use neighborhoods are classified into
five different neighborhood types. These neighborhood types are set out below:
1. Standard Residential Neighborhoods. New standard residential neighborhoods follow the traditional style of
development, where most of the land is comprised of a single housing type with small amounts of open space
(see Section 4.1.201, Standard Residential Neighborhoods).
2. Planned Residential Neighborhoods. New planned residential neighborhoods offer more flexibility in site design
by combining smaller and averaged lot sizes combined with multiple housing types in a planned community.
These types of neighborhoods set aside more common open space, provide greater protections of natural
resources, and have potential for higher densities than standard residential neighborhoods (see Section 4.1.202,
Planned Residential Neighborhoods).
3. Mixed-Use Planned Development. New mixed-use planned developments allow the combination of vertical and
horizontal mixed-residential and nonresidential uses (see Section 4.1.203, Mixed-Use Planned Development).
4. Manufactured Home Park and Subdivisions. New manufactured home parks and subdivisions are allowed in
accordance with this Division, Section 4.1.204, Manufactured Home Parks and Subdivisions, and other applicable
sections of this UDC.
5. Recreational Vehicle Parks. New recreational vehicle parks are allowed in accordance with this Division, Section
4.1.205, Recreational Vehicle Parks, and other applicable sections of this UDC.
D. Use of Neighborhood and Housing Types. The Suburban Residential (SR) and General Residential (GR) districts
provide for different neighborhood types. Within each district, all neighborhoods are permitted as specified in Table
2.2.102B, Residential Neighborhood Types, subject to the standards set out in Table 3.1.101, Residential
Development Standards. The allowable housing types per neighborhood are set out in Table 2.2.102A, Residential
and Commercial Uses of the Home, and the dimensional standards for each housing type are set out in the tables in
Section 3.1.102, New Residential Lot and Yard Standards.
E. Interpretation of Table. The table columns may be interpreted as follows:
1. District and Neighborhood Type sets out each zoning district and the neighborhood types permitted with them.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 59
2. Minimum Lot Size sets out the lot size that is used together with the minimum open space ratio (OSR) to
establish the maximum gross density (e.g., maximum number of dwelling units) for each neighborhood type.
3. Minimum Open Space Ratio (OSR) sets out the minimum amount of common open space that is required for
each neighborhood. The open space may be used to preserve environmental resources (e.g., floodplains and
riparian areas, etc.), provide open space for recreational amenities (e.g., parks, trails, and greenways), and/or to
buffer abutting development.
4. Maximum Gross Density sets out the maximum number of dwelling units per acre that may be constructed byright
in each district and for each neighborhood type.
5. Minimum Area of Development sets out the minimum area of land required to develop planned residential
neighborhoods.
6. Utility Requirement sets out whether on-site utilities (e.g., well and septic) are allowed or whether public utilities
are required. This requirement is based on the minimum lot size and development density.

TABLE NOTES:
N/A - Not Applicable
1. In certain circumstances, a greater open space ratio may be required to protect floodplains. Planned residential
neighborhoods offers the highest densities with the greatest amount of open space for resource protection purposes.
2. Manufactured home parks or subdivisions are a conditional use development option in the Suburban Residential (SR) and
General Residential (GR) districts as set out in Table 2.2.102A, Residential and Commercial Uses of the Home. See also Section
4.1.204, Manufactured Home Parks and Subdivisions. A manufactured home subdivision utilizes the standards for standard
neighborhood, while the manufactured home park utilizes the standards for a planned residential neighborhood.
3. Planned residential neighborhood includes mixed housing neighborhoods set out in Section 4.1.202, Planned Residential
Neighborhoods.
4. Manufactured housing cannot be combined with any other housing type as part of a planned residential neighborhood.
5. Development within the OT District shall meet the City's stormwater requirements and parcels larger than five acres shall have
a minimum open space ratio of 10 percent.
6. In combining non-conforming lots or subdividing large lots within OT District, a plat variance to allow deviation from minimum
lot area, not exceeding 10%, may be approved at the City Commissions discretion provided that:
a. No more than two (2) adjoining lots deviate from the minimum lot area requirement.
b. The plat application is accompanied with a site development plan indicating compliance with all other development
regulations that apply to the proposed development.
F. Requirements for Phased Developments. The maximum residential development capacity of the entire parcel
proposed for development shall be used for calculating compliance with the minimum open space ratio and
maximum gross density set out in Table 3.1.101, Residential Development Standards.
Effective on: 4/15/2019
Sec. 3.1.102 New Residential Lot and Yard Standards
A. Generally. Once the allowable housing and neighborhood types are determined per zoning district (see Section
2.2.102, Residential and Commercial Uses of the Home), the lot and building standards may be determined by using
Table 3.1.102A, Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards and Table 3.1.102B, Single-Family Attached and
Multi-Family Lot and Building Standards. Flexible provisions allowing lot variability in planned residential
neighborhoods are set out in Subsection D., Lot Averaging, below.
B. Single-Family Detached Dwellings. Single-family detached dwellings are permitted in each neighborhood type in the
Suburban Residential (SR) and General Residential districts as specified in Table 2.1.102, Residential and Commercial
Uses of the Home. The lot area and width; front, interior and street side, and rear setbacks; building height and
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 61
minimum pervious cover requirements are established for single-family detached dwellings as set out in Table
3.1.102A, Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards.

TABLE NOTES:
1. The front setback for a downtown loft is to accommodate a minimum 10' sidewalk.
2. The interior and street side yard for multi-family dwellings is also the minimum separation between buildings.
3. No rear yard setback is required for a downtown loft except as required for on-site parking.
4. Live-work units in the form of a townhouse shall meet the requirements for all townhouses.
5. If unit has a street side facing garage, a minimum 25' street side setback is required.
D. Lot Averaging. Lot averaging is a design technique that replaces minimum lot dimensions with an average lot width
and size.
1. Applicability. The use of lot averaging is optional for the standard residential neighborhood types and required
for planned residential neighborhood types, in the Suburban Residential (SR), General Residential (GR),
Downtown (DT), and the Mixed-Use (MU) districts. For these required neighborhood types, the lot area and
width dimensions set out in Table 3.1.102A, Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards and Table
3.1.102B, Single-Family Attached and Multiple-Family Lot and Building Standards are the average dimensions of
each neighborhood and housing type. Lot averaging may only be applied where both of the following conditions
apply:
a. Equal to or Greater. The average lot area and average lot width for each neighborhood or housing type are
equal to or greater than the lot area and lot width specified for the respective neighborhood and housing
types set out in Table 3.1.102A, Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards, and Table 3.1.102B,
Single-Family Attached and Multiple-Family Lot and Building Standards.
b. Greater than 90 Percent. No lot has a lot area or lot width that is less than 90 percent of that specified in
these tables (see Figure 3.1.102, Lot Averaging).
2. Exception. Lot averaging is not applicable for lots using the planned residential neighborhood (Manufactured
Home Park) development option.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 63
3. Distribution of Averaged Lots. Lots shall be distributed as follows:
a. In standard and planned residential neighborhoods, different sized lots (small lots, average lots, and large
lots) shall be mixed on each street segment so that they are spread through the development. Concentrating
lots of a single lot size in separate areas of a development is not allowed.
b. In a mixed housing neighborhoods, a mix of housing types or diverse single-family detached lot sizes may be
designated on a single block or street segment. Such developments are not required to comply with the
above requirement for standard and planned residential neighborhoods.

Lot Averaging
(Ord. No. 2019-16, 04/15/2019)
Effective on: 4/15/2019
Sec. 3.1.103 Existing Residential Lots, Parcels, and Neighborhoods
A. Generally. This Section establishes the standards for the development, redevelopment, and substantial
improvement of parcels, lots, and buildings that were undeveloped or being used as a residential dwelling unit on
the effective date of this UDC, by allowing the use of the standards from the underlying zoning district or by using
the alternate standards set out in this Section.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is provide for individual lot owner and overall neighborhood stability while at
the same time allowing for reasonable expansion and improvement, and in some cases, new construction, in areas
that are surrounded by or adjacent to or had established residential dwellings.
C. Conforming Buildings and Lots.
1. Buildings. All residential buildings that lawfully existed or were the subject of an active building permit on the
effective date of this UDC are "conforming" buildings with respect to the height and setback requirements set
out in this Section. However, this Section does not make the following buildings conforming:
a. Buildings that were constructed without required permits; and
b. Buildings that were constructed in violation of permit requirements.
2. Lots. All lots with residential dwellings that lawfully existed on the effective date of this UDC are "conforming"
with respect to lot width and lot area.
3. Parcels. Any parcels of land that were undeveloped as of the effective date of this UDC shall conform to the
standards set out for the OT District in Table 3.1.101, Residential Development Standards, and Table 3.1.102A,
Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards.
D. Nonresidential Uses.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 64
1. All lawfully permitted nonresidential uses may be continued, provided that they were constructed in
conformance with the original permit and the development regulations at the time of permitting.
2. Expansions to existing nonresidential uses shall be in conformance with the original permit and the development
regulations at the time of permitting. If an expansion was not considered during the initial grant of approval, the
expansion shall comply with Subsection D.3., below.
3. Substantial improvement, redevelopment, and new nonresidential development, shall comply with all applicable
provisions of this UDC, including those set out in Chapter 2, Zoning Districts and Land Uses, Division 2.2.200,
Limited and Conditional Use Standards, Division 3.1.200, Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Intensity, Lot, and Scale
Standards, Chapter 5, Buildings and Structures, applicable sections of Chapter 4, Site Design, among other
applicable sections of this UDC.
E. General Development Standards. The following general development standards apply to existing undeveloped
parcels or residential lots / units which existed on the effective date of this UDC.
1. Existing Residential Lots/Units Not Within a Platted Subdivision.
a. Residential lots which have an existing residential dwelling unit on the effective date of this UDC:
1. Which can meet the lot and yard standards of the underlying zoning district shall comply (regarding
substantial improvement and/or redevelopment) with the standards set out in Section 3.1.102, New
Residential Lot and Yard Standards.
2. Which cannot meet the lot and yard standards of the underlying zoning district shall utilize the alternate
standards set out in Subsection F., Alternate Development Standards, of this Section.
3. Which cannot meet the standards of the underlying zoning district or the alternate standards, below, may
apply for a variance (see Section 6.3.409, Variances).
b. Lots may be substantially improved or redeveloped only with the same housing type and number of units
that existed on the effective date of this UDC.
2. Existing Residential Lots/Units Within a Platted Subdivision.
a. Residential lots within a platted subdivision that existed on the effective date of this UDC shall comply with
the lot and yard standards that were approved as part of the final plat.
b. Residential lots that cannot comply with the lot and yard standards established by the final plat may apply for
a variance (see Section 6.3.409, Variances).
3. Undeveloped Parcels. Undeveloped parcels that existed on the effective date of this UDC may be developed in
accordance with standards set out in Table 3.1.101, Residential Development Standards, and Table 3.1.102A,
Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards.
F. Alternate Development Standards. This Subsection applies only to lots with existing residential dwellings that are
not located within a platted subdivision. If the lot can meet the standards of the underlying zoning district (e.g.,
front, interior side, street side, and/or rear setbacks), then the proposed construction shall be reviewed using the
standards set out in Section 3.1.102, New Residential Lot and Yard Standards, rather than this Subsection.
1. Relationship to Variances. Compliance with the standards of this Subsection are not considered variances.
Variances shall not be granted if the proposed construction could be permitted pursuant to the alternative
standards of this Subsection.
2. Relationship to Easements and Rights-of-Way. The standards of this Subsection shall not be construed to
authorize construction of buildings, or portions of buildings, in utility or drainage easements or public rights-ofway.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 65
3. Reduced Setbacks. Reduced setbacks shall be applied only if it is demonstrated that the standards of this
Subsection are met, and:
a. The proposed construction does not interfere with planned expansion of right-of-way, and if right-of-way
expansion is planned, the proposed construction is evaluated as if the right-of-way has been expanded;
b. The proposed construction does not result in interference with a utility easement;
c. Drainage onto abutting properties or rights-of-way is not significantly altered, and drainage patterns are not
substantially changed, when compared to the condition before the proposed construction;
d. The proposed construction does not result in a nonconformity with respect to the building code on either the
parcel proposed for development or abutting properties;
e. If the parcel that abuts the proposed construction is used for residential purposes, the proposed construction
is built to building code standards that would allow construction of the abutting lot to be built to the same
standard along the same setback line; and
f. The proposed construction does not reduce the area provided for parking to fewer spaces than required or
than currently accommodated.
4. Front Setback Averaging. Front setbacks may be reduced to the average front setback along the same side of the
same street segment measured for a distance of up to 1,000 feet or up to five lots in either direction, whichever
is less, provided that:
a. The parcel proposed for development is not counted in the calculation;
b. The principal dwelling or garage does not encroach upon any easement;
c. The on-site garage must be setback a minimum 25 feet to accommodate a vehicle parked in front of the
dwelling and is in compliance with Subsection G., below; and
d. If the lot takes vehicular access from the front, the driveway must be at least 25 feet long, measured from
the property line at the right-of-way to a building wall or garage door (see Figure 3.1.103, Illustrative Front
Setback Averaging).
5. Reduced Interior Side Setbacks. Interior side setbacks may be reduced on any lot if it is demonstrated that the
proposed interior side setback is equal to not more than 10 percent less than the average actual setback of the
other homes on the same side of the same street, measured for a distance of up to 1,000 feet or up to five lots in
either direction, whichever is less.
6. Reduced Street Side Setbacks. The street side setback may be reduced on any lot if it is demonstrated that the
proposed street side setback is equal to not more than 10 percent less than the average actual street side
setback of the other homes in the immediate subdivision, and the street is classified as a minor residential street
and there are no plans for expansion of the paved width of the street.
7. Reduced Rear Setbacks. Rear setbacks may be reduced on any lot if it is demonstrated that the proposed rear
building setback is equal to not more than 10 percent less than the average actual setback of the other homes on
the same side of the same street, measured for a distance of up to 1,000 feet or up to five lots in either direction.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 66
Figure 3.1.103
Illustrative Front Setback Averaging
In the illustration above, the general setback, labeled "G," is 20 feet. However, the average setback of all other lots on the same
side of the street segment is 14 ft. ((10 + 15 + 10 + 25 + 10) / 5 = 14), which is labeled as "A."
If the building on the parcel proposed for development meets the vehicular access requirements of a 9 ft. x 25 ft. driveway, the
front setback may be reduced to 14 feet.
G. Infill and Redevelopment Standards.
1. Design Standards. The following standards shall be used for the review, approval, and then construction on
vacant lots, or for reconstruction or substantial alteration or improvement of dilapidated, deteriorated, or
obsolete dwelling units in blighted neighborhoods.
a. Use. The land use of the infill unit shall conform to the uses set out in Division 2.2, Land Use.
b. Setbacks. Setbacks shall comply with this Section, or the standards set out in Section 3.1.104, Alternative
Standards for Non-Typical Land Ownership Patterns.
c. Orientation. The infill, redeveloped, or substantially altered or improved unit shall be oriented in the same
direction and manner as the adjacent dwelling units on the block face for which the lot is part or within 300
feet on either side of the unit. For the purposes of this requirement, the primary entrance and windows shall
face the street with the lesser lot dimension (see Section 5.1.101, Single-Family Detached and Attached
Design Standards).
d. Massing and Form. The general shape, three-dimensional forms, and articulated elements of the infill,
redeveloped, or substantially altered or improved unit shall be generally cohesive with the style and design
of the dwelling units on the block face and the immediate neighborhood.
e. Height. The number of stories and overall height of the infill, redeveloped, or substantially altered or
improved unit shall be consistent with the prevailing building heights on the block face and in the immediate
neighborhood.
f. Scale. The square footage of the infill, redeveloped, or substantially altered or improved unit shall be no less
than 80 percent and no greater than 120 percent of the dwelling units on the block face for which the infill
lot is part.
g. Roof Type and Pitch. The type of roof and its pitch shall be consistent with other dwellings in the immediate
neighborhood.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 67
h. Materials. The exterior building and roof materials shall be consistent with the material types of other
dwelling units within a 300 foot radius in all directions.
i. Access. The prevailing means of access via street or alley for the lots on the block face shall be maintained.
j. Garages. If a majority of the dwellings on the block face have a garage, the infill, redeveloped, or substantially
altered or improved unit shall also have a garage, either attached or detached, consistent with the majority
of other dwellings.
k. Driveway. The length, width, and surface of the driveway, as applicable, shall be consistent with the majority
of other dwellings on the block face.
2. Modifications and Adjustments. The following variations may be approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission:
a. Variation of the setbacks as set out in Section 3.1.104, Alternative Standards for Non-Typical Land Ownership
Patterns.
b. An alternate building orientation that fits the lot shape and dimensions without affecting the privacy of
adjacent properties or unnecessarily altering the pattern of home fronts.
c. Allowance of a one-story home between two-story homes provided a similar pattern exists on other block
faces in the immediate neighborhood.
d. Variation of the square footage provided the bulk and volume of the infill, redeveloped, or substantially
altered or improved unit is not out of scale with the adjacent dwelling units and those on the block face.
e. Approval of variations to the building and roof materials.
f. Exception to the requirement for a driveway or garage provided there is a pattern of other homes in the
immediate neighborhood without driveways or garages.
Sec. 3.1.104 Alternate Standards for Non-Typical Land Ownership Patterns
A. Generally. The standards of Division 3.1.100, Residential Density, Lot, and Scale Standards, or Division 3.1.200,
Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Intensity, Lot, and Scale Standards, with respect to lot area, lot width, and setbacks
relate to the development of residential, nonresidential, and mixed-use buildings on conventional lots that are
intended to be owned in fee-simple by the owners of the buildings. However, the standards are not intended to
preclude other ownership types, such as condominiums (in which the land is owned in common by the owners of the
condominium units), or common maintenance communities (in which fee simple ownership is limited to the land
under the building, and, in some cases, a small area around it). The alternative standards provided for by this Section
are intended to allow such alternative ownership scenarios, provided that the parcel proposed for development
could be approved pursuant to this UDC using conventional fee-simple ownership arrangements.
B. Demonstration of Compliance Required. The proposed pattern of development will be permitted if it is
demonstrated that it will comply with the density/intensity, open space, and applicable setback requirements of this
UDC if it were platted with lots that meet the minimum requirements of Division 3.1.100, Residential Density, Lot,
and Scale Standards, for each of the proposed housing types or Division 3.1.200, Nonresidential and Mixed-Use
Intensity, Lot, and Scale Standards.
Division 3.1.200 Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Intensity, Lot, and Scale Standards
Sec. 3.1.201 Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Development Standards
A. Generally. The standards that are applicable to nonresidential and mixed-use parcels proposed for development are
provided in Table 3.1.201A, Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Development Standards. The table includes provisions for

1. No off-street parking is required in the DN district, except for downtown lofts, townhouses, and live-work units, where the required number of spaces
per housing type shall be provided on-site in parking lots that are located behind the principal building (which is built to the street) or in garages that
take access from an alley, or on off-site parking lots located within 200 feet of the parcel proposed for development.
2. The FARs account for the landscape surface ratio (including setbacks, bufferyards, on-site drainage, and parking lot landscape areas) and required on-site
parking, excluding the DN district. Multiplying the site area by the FAR determines the maximum building size.
3. Refer to Subsection D.2.c., Setback Planes, of this Section.
4. Refer to the maximum gross density for downtown lofts in the downtown DN district.
5. Refer to the maximum gross density for live-work units and multi-family in the MU district.
6. Ten spaces per acre are allowed for recreational vehicle parks.
C. Subdivision of Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Parcels.
1. Street Frontage and Area. The minimum street frontage and minimum area of parcels proposed for development
may be reduced with respect to the subdivision of individual lots within a development if it is demonstrated that:
a. The area of the principal parcel from which the lot is subdivided complies with the requirements of Table
3.1.201A, Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Development Standards, before subdivision;
b. Appropriate easements are recorded to provide for:
1. Cross-access between the lots;
2. Compliance with Article 4.2, Parking, Loading, Access, and Lighting; and
3. Appropriate covenants, conditions, or restrictions (CCRs) are recorded that provide for the required
landscape surface ratio (LSR) to be maintained in proportion to the principal parcel area before the
subdivision, designating the landscaped areas, and providing for their maintenance.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 69
2. Building Spacing. For the purposes of the requirements of Table 3.1.201B, Nonresidential and Mixed-Use
Setbacks, lots created pursuant to this Section shall be considered part of the principal parcel. However,
buildings shall be spaced at least 20 feet apart.
3. Access. Lots created pursuant to this Section are not entitled to individual access to abutting streets unless they
meet the access management requirements set out in Division 4.2.200, Access Management and Circulation.
4. Required Buffer. Lots created pursuant to this Section are not required to be buffered from the principal parcel
from which they are subdivided unless they are in different zoning districts.
D. Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Setbacks.
1. Generally. The standards of this Section apply to nonresidential and vertically mixed-use buildings. If Division
4.4.300, Buffering, requires a bufferyard that is wider than the setback that is required by this Section, then the
width of the setback shall be at least the width of the required bufferyard.
2. Principal Buildings.
a. The required setbacks for nonresidential and mixed-use buildings are set out in Table 3.1.201B,
Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Setbacks.
b. Residential district boundary setbacks (set out in the last row of Table 3.1.201B, Nonresidential and Mixed-
Use Setbacks), apply to buildings or outdoor uses (except parking) on parcels that abut property that is
located in the SR and GR districts. If the residential district boundary setback is indicated as "N/A," then there
are no special setback requirements in relation to abutting residentially zoned property (e.g., the other
columns of the table control).

doors, or other openings constructed on that side of the second story facing the residential district or use.
3. Refer to Subsection E., DN District Setbacks, of this Section.
c. Setback Planes. Where a nonresidential or mixed-use building abuts or is contiguous to a residentially zoned
or used property, then in addition to the building setback line set out in Table 3.1.201B, Nonresidential and
Mixed-Use Setbacks, the building shall be set back one foot from the property line for each one foot in
building height over the maximum building height that is set out in Table 3.1.201A, Nonresidential and
Mixed-Use Standards (see Figure 3.1.201A, Setback Planes).
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 70
Figure 3.1.201A
Setback Planes
E. DN District Setbacks.
1. Generally. For all development in the DN district, principal structures shall be built on the front lot line (the
"build-to line"). Portions of the façade that are recessed in order to satisfy the requirements of Division 5.1.200,
Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Design Standards, and Division 5.1.300, Special District Design Standards, are
permitted to be set back from the build-to line by up to three feet. All buildings shall meet these requirements,
except under the following conditions:
a. Where the use, in whole or in part, is an existing dwelling unit.
b. Where the use is established in an existing building that exceeds the build-to line as of the effective date of
this UDC. In this case, the existing building may:
1. Remain in its current location, utilizing the front setback as:
a. A yard or courtyard;
b. Public plaza or outdoor service area (e.g., outdoor seating for a restaurant, outdoor display area for a
retail store, etc.); or
c. Off-street parking provided it was used for parking as of the effective date of this UDC.
2. Be extended to the build-to line provided it:
a. Meets all other requirements and standards of this UDC;
b. Is a conforming use; and
c. Complies with Subsection E.1.d., below (e.g., provision for a public sidewalk).
c. Where the average setback of buildings along the block front or, in the instance of a corner lot, along one or
both block fronts, exceed the build-to line, the building may be:
1. Constructed at the build-to line; or
2. Set back to match the average front setback along the same side of the same street segment in the same
zoning district, provided that the parcel proposed for development or redevelopment is not counted in
the calculation.
d. Where there is a public sidewalk that is up to six feet wide, the building must be set back in order to provide
the additional space to expand the sidewalk onto the private lot to construct a sidewalk that is at least six
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 71
feet in width. In this case, the building shall be constructed to a build-to line that is coterminous with the
edge of the sidewalk that is provided on the private lot.
e. Buildings may be set back up to a distance of 20 feet from the build-to line in order to provide a publicly
available pedestrian seating area (e.g., a public plaza, restaurant outdoor seating area, etc.):
1. The public plaza or outdoor service area shall be designated upon development approval and maintained
as a publicly accessible space;
2. Any service uses that take place in the designated setback area must directly relate to the activity of the
primary ground floor use (e.g., outdoor seating for a restaurant, outdoor display area for a retail store,
etc.); and
3. When the area is not being used as an outdoor service area, it shall remain generally accessible to the
public and function as an extension of the public sidewalk environment.
2. Side and Rear Setbacks. Side and rear setbacks are not required in the DN district, except when the DN district
directly abuts a SR or GR residential district, then the same setbacks applicable to the residential district shall
also apply to the abutting or contiguous lot line(s) of the SR or GR district.
3. Encroachments. The City may permit, by recorded license agreement, encroachments into the public right-ofway
if the encroachments meet all of the following standards (see Figure 3.1.201B, Permitted Encroachments):
a. Encroachments up to 18 inches into the right-of-way are permitted below an elevation of eight feet above
grade if it is demonstrated that:
1. The encroachment does not impact the general functionality of the public sidewalk; and
2. The encroachment does not make the sidewalk noncompliant with the requirements of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).
b. Encroachments up to four feet are permitted above an elevation of eight feet above grade if it is
demonstrated that:
1. The encroachment does not impact the general functionality of the public sidewalk;
2. The encroachment is set back at least one foot from the face of the curb; and
3. The encroachment does not create unsafe clearances from other elements of the right-of-way (e.g.,
street lighting, landscaping, vehicular movement, etc.).

CHAPTER 4 SITE DESIGN
ARTICLE 4.1 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
Division 4.1.100 General Requirements for Development Design
Sec. 4.1.101 Lots
A. Generally.
1. New lots shall be dimensioned according to the requirements of Section 3.1.102, Residential Lot and Yard
Standards. The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate to the district in which they are located,
the location of the parcel proposed for development, and to the type of development contemplated. The lots
shall provide an adequate buildable area for the development that is contemplated.
2. Lots are required to be platted unless specifically exempted by this UDC or the Texas Local Government Code.
Lots shall be of appropriate size and arrangement to provide for adequate off-street parking, loading facilities,
landscaping, and other required site improvements or open space/bufferyard areas. No lot shall be created for
any nonresidential use that has an area, width, or depth that is less than required to accommodate the use and
all site requirements under this UDC.
3. The subdividing of land shall be such as to provide, by means of a public or private street, each lot with
satisfactory access to a public or private street according to Subsection C., below.
B. Shape. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the centerlines of abutting streets. Alternative
configurations may be approved in order to accomplish a public purpose, such as the preservation of natural
resources.
C. Access and Frontage.
1. Frontage Width. The width of required frontage shall not be less than the required lot width.
2. Residential Lots (except mixed-use and multi-family).
a. Generally, new single-family detached and single-family attached dwellings shall front only on minor
residential streets. Alternatively, such lots may front on common open spaces, provided that vehicular access
is taken from an alley that serves not more than 12 dwelling units. Through lots shall take access from the
side from which the address is assigned, which shall not be collector or arterial streets.
b. Manufactured home lots may front only on minor residential streets or private streets within a manufactured
home park or subdivision.
3. Nonresidential, Mixed-Use, and Multi-Family Lots. Nonresidential, mixed-use, and multi-family lots that take
access from collector or arterial streets shall provide adequate on-site maneuvering areas for automobile
turnaround.
D. Double Frontage and Reverse Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. Access easements are not permitted.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 74
E. Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width of 10 feet to permit appropriate building setback
and orientation to both streets. When corner lots side upon an arterial or collector street, no driveway or garage
entrance shall enter on upon the street.
F. Orientation to T-Intersections. The building envelope of lots at the terminal end of a T-intersection shall be offset a
minimum distance of 25 feet from the centerline of the terminated street in order to mitigate the impacts of
oncoming traffic on the use and enjoyment of the lots.
G. Areas of Special Flood Hazard. Residential lots that are intended for conveyance into private ownership shall be
platted outside the Regulatory Floodway.
Sec. 4.1.102 Blocks
A. Generally. The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be determined with regard to the following:
1. Provision of an adequate building site suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated;
2. Requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions as set out in Article 3.1, Residential and Nonresidential Development
Standards;
3. Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic;
4. Limitations and opportunities of topography; and
5. Needs for the provision of mobility and accessibility for people who use alternative modes of transportation.
B. Dimensions. Blocks shall be dimensioned according to the following standards:
1. Blocks that are used to provide access to single-family detached and/or single-family attached dwellings shall be
of sufficient width to allow two tiers of lots with appropriate lot depths (according to the lot widths and areas
applied), unless such arrangement is not feasible and acceptance is authorized by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
2. Generally, intersecting streets determining the lengths and widths of the blocks shall be provided at such
intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet existing streets or customary subdivision practices.
a. Block Length.
1. Minimum Block Length. Block length shall be a minimum of 500 feet; however, this standard may be
varied in cases where physical barriers or property ownership creates conditions where it is appropriate
that these standards be varied having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of traffic and public
safety.
2. Maximum Block Length. Block length shall be a maximum of 1,200 feet, except where no existing
subdivision controls, the block length may increase to 1,400 feet.
b. Mid-Block Crossing . Blocks 1,200 feet or longer in length may provide a mid-block pedestrian access
easement to provide access to abutting blocks. If a mid-block pedestrian easement is required or added, they
shall be constructed by the developer.
3. Blocks for nonresidential or mixed-use shall be of a width suitable for the intended use, with due allowance for
off-street parking and loading facilities and other site improvements, including landscape, bufferyard, and open
space areas required by this UDC.
4. When possible, the block width or depth shall allow two tiers of lots, back-to-back, except when prevented by
the size of the property or the need to back on an identified thoroughfare. When adjacent to a thoroughfare, the
subdivider may not double front lots.
C. Relationship to Existing Arterial and Collector Streets. Residential blocks shall be designed so that lots are not
oriented for access from arterial or collector streets. Marginal access streets may be approved if necessary for the
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 75
efficient layout of lots on a parcel proposed for development, provided that bufferyards are provided between the
marginal access street and the abutting arterial or collector street as follows:
1. Collector streets: Type A bufferyard; and
2. Arterial streets: Type B bufferyard (see also Section 4.4.301, Buffering).
D. Numbering. Blocks shall be numbered consecutively within the overall plat and shall be consistent with adjacent
plats.
Sec. 4.1.103 Access and Easements
A. Generally. During the development approval process, the City may require a variety of easements on private
property or lots. These easements may be for any of the following, or other approved, purposes:
1. Natural resource or open space conservation;
2. Pedestrian access;
3. Solid waste removal;
4. Police protection and other emergency services;
5. Fire protection or hazard mitigation;
6. Access to public utilities or drainage areas;
7. Utilities; and
8. Drainage and low impact development applications.
B. Aerial Easements. Aerial easements shall be provided where needed.
C. Utility Easements. Easements across lots or centered on rear and side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where
necessary and shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide for two utility services (e.g., electric, gas, telephone, etc.) or 14
feet to 20 feet for two or more utility services. Consideration for size and alignment of utility easements shall be
determined by the City Engineer.
D. Water and Wastewater Easements. Easements required for water and wastewater shall be 10 feet in width in the
right-of-way of the front property line or as otherwise specified by the City Engineer.
E. Drainage and Stormwater Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse (or drainage way, or bayou
channel), there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage easement conforming substantially with lines of such
watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and approval by
the City Engineer and Fort Bend County Drainage District, as applicable.
F. Fire Protection Easements. Rear fire protection access easements, where necessary to provide adequate protection
for the structure, shall be improved as appropriate for fire protection equipment, at a minimum width of 20 feet,
with appropriate turning radii for the Citys fire protection equipment as determined by the Fire Department.
G. Pedestrian Access Easements. Pedestrian access easements may be required in accordance with Article 4.5, Streets,
Sidewalks, and Alleys.
H. Encroachments and Removal of Encroachments. No permanent encroachments or structures and no overhanging
limbs, shrubbery, or vegetation of any kind shall be allowed to be located within the area of any easement required
by this Section. While the City or utility provider benefiting from the easement will make efforts to minimize
disturbances, both shall have the right to remove any encroachment, structure, fence, landscaping, or other
improvements placed upon or over such easement. The City and/or utility provider shall not be obligated to restore
or replace any such encroachment but shall restore any disturbed ground surfaces with seeding. The City may assess
the cost of removing an unauthorized improvement from an easement against the landowner, including the placing
of a lien on the property.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 76
I. Maintenance of Easements. The responsibility for the regular maintenance of the ground surface in any easement
shall rest with the owner of the property within which the easement exists.
Sec. 4.1.104 Open Spaces
A. Generally. This Section is designed to achieve the open space requirements of bufferyards, resource protection,
recreation, stormwater management, and preservation of community character.
B. Principles.
1. Integrated Design. Generally, open spaces shall be integrated into the development design to bring significant
open space to the maximum number of properties, as well as visibility from public rights-of-way within the parcel
proposed for development. Visual or physical access to open spaces may be limited if such limitations would
materially enhance natural resource management.
2. Trails and Drainage Corridors/Waterbodies/Watercourses. Open space shall be designed to provide trails along
drainage corridors, waterbodies, and watercourses. The landscaping along drainage corridors, waterbodies,
watercourses shall be designed to enhance the filtering of surface and subsurface water flows. Trails shall
provide access along the drainage corridor or watercourse for the residents of the proposed development.
3. Other Open Spaces. Formal open spaces shall be designed to provide areas of focus within the development.
Landscaping, furniture, and other amenities for pedestrians shall be installed to enhance this effect.
C. Design. The proposed subdivision plat or site plan shall be designed to allocate required open space and/or
landscape areas according to the following priorities.
1. Buffers. Provide appropriate buffers between areas of different uses in accordance with the provisions set out in
Section 4.4.301, Buffering.
2. Tree Protection. Provide for the protection of protected trees in accordance with the provisions of Section
4.4.203, Tree Preservation.
3. Recreation and Public Gathering Spaces.
a. Residential Districts. In residential districts, use required open space areas to provide active and passive
recreation opportunities.
b. Mixed-Use Districts. In mixed-use districts (i.e., the Downtown district), use required open space areas to
provide for public gathering spaces such as landscape plazas (i.e., visible and accessible from the street), and
landscaped courtyards or atriums (i.e., visible and accessible to building occupants).
Sec. 4.1.105 Streets
A. Generally. This Section sets out the general subdivision and land planning considerations for the layout and
alignment of streets. The design objectives, criteria, and dimensional requirements for streets, cul-de-sacs, or alleys
are provided in Article 4.5, Streets, Sidewalks, and Trails.
B. Conformity to the Plan. The general location, alignment, and functional classification of all streets shall conform to
the thoroughfare plan, as amended from time to time.
C. Alignment of Subdivision Streets with Existing Streets. Streets shall be configured as required by Section 4.5.102,
General Street Standards.
D. Alignment of Local Streets with Arterials and Collectors. Generally, minor residential streets shall either:
1. Intersect as near as possible at 90 degrees at intersections with arterial or collector streets; or
2. Be loop roads, reverse frontage roads, or cul-de-sacs (which are limited by Section 4.5.102, General Street
Standards). See Figure 4.1.105, Minor Residential Street Orientation.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 77
Figure 4.1.105
Minor Residential Street Orientation
E. Width of Public Ways. The minimum width of public street right-of-ways in subdivisions shall be established
according to the functional classifications of each street, pursuant to Section 4.5.102, General Street Standards.
F. Grades and Curves of Public Ways. The City Engineer shall promulgate the requirements for grades of public and
private streets.
Sec. 4.1.106 Utilities
A. Generally.
1. All developments shall make provision for water, sewer, stormwater, electric, telephone, and cable service, and
may make provision for fiber-to-the-home and other public and/or private utilities available to City residents.
2. All drainage and utilities shall be efficiently and unobtrusively integrated into the design and shall avoid off-site
impacts.
B. Capacity. Where a parcel proposed for development is part of a larger tract of land, the City shall require the
capacity of facilities to be adequate to serve the entire tract to the extent that the capacity is matched to that of the
lines that are extended to the parcel proposed for development. Where the parcel proposed for development is part
of a larger utility service area, the City may require the capacity of the appropriate facilities to be adequate to serve
the remainder of the service area.
C. Potable Water Line Loops. Potable water lines shall be looped.
D. Interceptors. Where an interceptor is to be extended through the area being developed, the landowner shall
provide the necessary easements.
E. Common Use Easements. Wherever possible, the City shall require compatible utilities to share easements (see
Section 4.1.103, Access and Easements).
Sec. 4.1.107 Master Preliminary Plat and Development Phasing
A. Generally. A parcel proposed for development may be developed in phases, which each phase separately platted. In
such cases, the applicant shall submit a master preliminary plat with the first application for preliminary plat for
development approval. The master preliminary plat shall show compliance with this UDC by showing:
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 78
1. The general arrangements of streets, blocks, and utilities, and how they will connect to the streets shown on the
first application for preliminary plat approval;
2. The general location of drainage facilities;
3. The general location of protected natural resources and open spaces; and
4. The general location of proposed uses and housing types.
B. Consistency with Concept Plan. In considering each subsequent phase shown on a master preliminary plat, the
Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Commission may impose conditions that are necessary to assure the
orderly development of the platted land. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, temporary alley and
street extensions, temporary cul-de-sacs, and off-site utility extensions.
Sec. 4.1.108 Naming and Numbering
A. Generally. To facilitate way-finding and the provision of emergency response services, the name of a subdivision,
other land development, and streets shall not be the same or substantially similar to the name of another
subdivision, other land development, or the name of an existing street, which is located within the City or its
extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ).
B. Residential Subdivision and Nonresidential Complex Names.
1. Naming. Residential subdivisions, other residential land development (e.g., multi-family apartment complexes or
condominiums, etc.), and nonresidential complexes (e.g., office or industrial parks, etc.), shall not be duplicated
or be confused with existing names. Names are subject to approval by the Code Official to eliminate duplicate
names.
2. Exception. Exceptions shall be made for a group of related, abutting subdivisions (or other land development)
that are part of an overall plan of development which include common names according to a common theme
(e.g., Grand Lakes, Grand Meadow, Grand Mission, Grand River, etc.), or given the same name followed by a
phase number to identify each phase of the project.
C. Street Names.
1. Naming. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the
assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically
similar to existing street name, irrespective of the use of suffix (e.g., Pecan Street versus Pecan Avenue) and/or
prefix (e.g., West Austin Street versus East Austin Street) if the streets are not contiguous and separated by a
thoroughfare that commonly separates the City into quadrants. All streets shall be appropriately named.
2. Interagency Coordination. Street names will be submitted in writing to the 9-1-1 Coordinator of the Fort Bend
County Sheriff's Office Emergency Operations and Communications, in Richmond, Texas, for additional review as
it relates to the provision of dispatching emergency services.
D. Property Numbering. The Code Official shall provide appropriate "property numbers" for all lots as specified.
Sec. 4.1.109 Dedications and Improvements
A. Generally. All dedications of streets, easements, open spaces, recreation areas, or any other dedication shall be
made on a form approved by the City. All dedicated areas shall be shown on the subdivision plat or site plan for the
parcel(s) proposed for development where such approvals are required, unless the City determines that another
form of dedication (e.g., a recorded easement) is more appropriate.
B. Easements. Easements for utilities and drainage shall be provided by the applicant as necessary to effectuate their
purpose.
C. Streets.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 79
1. Streets Within the Proposed Development. Street dedication(s) shall include required dedications of rights-of-way
as needed, or as required by the Thoroughfare Plan. Such dedications shall be made no later than the earliest of
the following events:
a. The submittal of a final plat for the first phase of development;
b. The approval of a site plan; or
c. The issuance of a permit for a new principal building or structure that has a value of at least 50 percent of the
assessed value of the land described in the permit application.
2. Existing Streets. Existing streets shall be evaluated based on the capacity and condition of the existing streets
ability to support the nature of uses proposed. Where found deficient, the streets shall be constructed or
reconstructed according to City standards based upon a traffic generation study or traffic impact analysis (if
required as a result of the traffic generation study or traffic impact analysis), that extends to the nearest street
capable of carrying the additional traffic generated by the proposed development. Right-of-way for such streets
shall be dedicated to the City or other entity that controls the impacted street right-of-way.
D. Open Space Parcels. Land areas that are used to satisfy open space ratio requirements shall be shown as separate
parcels on plats. The open space parcels shall be restricted to open space uses by plat restrictions or separately
recorded covenants, conditions, and restrictions (see also Section 4.1.110, Required Property Owners' Association
and Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CCRs)).
E. Recreation and Other Public Use Areas. Consideration shall be given by the developer to the dedication or
reservation of suitable sites for parks, playgrounds, and other areas for public use so as to conform to the
recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission in the adopted Comprehensive Master Plan or other plan
that focuses on parks and recreation areas in the City. Areas to be dedicated or reserved for parks, playgrounds, and
other public use areas should be indicated on the preliminary plat in order that it may be determined when and in
what manner such areas will be dedicated to, or acquired by the appropriate jurisdictional authority. In general,
whenever the proposed subdivision contains 20 acres or includes more than 100 lots, consideration shall be given to
the reservation or dedication of a suitable area for recreation purposes.
Sec. 4.1.110 Required Property Owners Association and Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CCRs)
A. Required Property Owner' Association.
1. Required. Any subdivision or development for which compliance with the standards of this UDC or with
conditions of approval requires a continuing obligation (e.g., to own and maintain common open space) shall be
subject to a mandatory property owners' association and a recorded declaration of covenants, conditions, and
restrictions (CCRs) that ensures such continuing compliance.
2. Incorporation of Property Owners' Association. If required by this UDC, or required as a condition of approval, the
applicant shall incorporate a property owners' association that will bear responsibility for ensuring continuing
compliance with these regulations and conditions of approval.
B. Required Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CCRs).
1. Required. Conditions and requirements of development approval that require ongoing efforts of tenants or
successors in title shall be included in a declaration of CCRs for the property that shall be recorded in the public
records in the chain of title for the property at the applicant's expense.
2. Limited Waiver. Developments that are approved under unified ownership and control are not required to have
CCRs, provided that a single property owner is responsible for the ongoing compliance of the parcel proposed for
development with the requirements of this UDC and any conditions of approval. However, a development that is
approved under unified ownership and control shall not be conveyed into multiple ownerships (e.g., individual
buildings in an office park being sold to separate entities) until required CCRs are recorded.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 80
3. Timing. The applicant shall provide proposed CCRs to the City:
a. Upon filing the application for plat approval; or
b. If no plat approval is sought, before the issuance of any permit that directly authorizes development
(development approvals that require CCRs shall be contingent upon approval of the CCR document).
4. Plat Annotations. Where a plat is required, a note shall be added to the plat that all properties shall be made part
of the property owners' associations and are required to comply with the CCRs.
C. Limited Review of Incorporation Documents and CCRs.
1. Generally. The City shall approve only those CCRs that relate to the development approval, and its right of
enforcement shall extend only to those matters and matters that substantially bear upon them. The City will not
seek to intervene in purely private disputes about CCRs. The City Attorney shall review the incorporation
documents and CCRs to ensure that the following provisions are included in a form that is acceptable to the City
Attorney:
a. All items that are required by this UDC or conditions of approval, which may include specific rights of
enforcement being granted to the City;
b. Membership in the property owners' association shall be mandatory for all owners of property in the
subdivision or condominium;
c. Dues are payable to the property owners' association at regular intervals;
d. The property owners' association has lien rights with respect to unpaid dues;

g. The property owners' association has the capacity to sue and be sued.
2. Optional Elements. The CCRs may include any provisions considered desirable by the applicant with respect to
the management and maintenance of the subdivision or condominium, provided that they do not undermine any
of the following requirements:
a. Required membership in, and payment of dues to, the property owners' association.
b. Inclusion and enforcement of all of the provisions required by these regulations and any conditions of
approval, in a form acceptable to the City Attorney;
c. Clauses that provide for enforceability by the City of those CCRs that relate to this UDC or conditions of
approval; and
d. Applicable requirements of this UDC at the time of approval of the CCR document.
Sec. 4.1.111 Survey and Monumentation
A. Survey Required.
1. Generally. The following shall be used for mapping natural resources or other features of subdivision plats, site
plans, or other plan or plat as otherwise required by this Section. In general, boundaries shall be measured as
follows:
a. Measurements for the boundary are to be made horizontally, perpendicular from, or radial from any feature
or point.
b. Boundaries that are dependent on elevation shall be based upon on-site elevations and shall not be
interpolated.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 81
2. Waterbodies and Watercourses.
a. Floodplains. All development within the City, not part of a previously approved plan or plat, shall show the
boundary of the floodplain and floodway, if such exist on the site. Such delineation shall be by a registered
professional land surveyor.
b. Streams. Streams (perennial, intermittent, mapped, and unmapped) with identifiable banks and beds shall
have their boundaries set at the top of the bank.
c. Wetlands. Wetlands shall be measured by the criteria of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
d. Other Waterbodies/Watercourses. Initial identification of other waterbodies/watercourses not otherwise
classified shall be made using the U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle maps or more accurate information, as
available. Field survey verification to determine evidence and location of channelized flow is required for
subdivision plats and site plans.
3. Soils. If septic tanks are to be used, soils shall be delineated by on-site testing of the soils to determine soil
boundaries.
4. Topography. Topographic lines shall be at one-foot contour intervals unless such intervals are impractical due to
essentially flat topography.
5. Vegetation. Vegetation shall be measured by the canopy line for the determination of areas of woodlands or
trees. Other vegetation types shall be measured from the middle of the vegetation transition.
B. Monumentation. Survey monuments shall be required.
1. Monument Markers. All boundary corners, angle points, or points of curvature or tangency, including block
corners, lot corners, street intersections, and all angle points and points of curvature in street lines must be
monumented by a surveyor using sufficient, stable and reasonably permanent survey markers.
2. Monument Size and Material. Describe each monument in such a way as to clearly define the size, type of
material, and the nature of the monument (i.e., three-fourths-inch iron pipe, five-eights-inch iron rod, cotton
spindle, mag nail, etc.).
3. Standards. All monuments shall be set to the standard of the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying
Practices Act and the general rules of practices and procedures of the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying
and shall bear reference caps as indicated.
4. Permanent Survey Markers. The establishment of reasonably permanent survey markers is a required
improvement. Where final plat approval is granted prior to completion of all required improvements, the
improvement agreement and any required security shall also apply to the establishmentof such permanent
survey markers. Monuments which are distributed during the course of construction must be reset by a surveyor
prior to issuance of a certificate of satisfactory completion of all required improvements.
5. Bench Marking.
a. Location. A bench mark monument or survey marker of a sufficient, stable, and reasonably permanent
nature shall be found or placed within the boundaries of or within 300 feet of the boundaries of the
subdivision for project elevation control.
b. Identification. The placement of the bench mark with the location, description, and elevation of the bench
mark shall be identified on the face of the plat.
c. Reference. All project bench marks and all project elevations shall be referenced to the published National
Geodetic Survey (NGS) datum adjustment of the current Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the property location. Equations may be used to translate other datum
adjustments to the required adjustment.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 82
C. As-Builts. As-built plans, certified by a registered land surveyor, shall be submitted to the Code Official and reviewed
by the City Engineer upon completion of subdivision infrastructure.
Division 4.1.200 Neighborhood Development Standards
Sec. 4.1.201 Standard Residential Neighborhoods
A. Generally. As set out in Section 3.1.101, Residential Development, standard residential neighborhoods follow the
traditional style of development, where most of the land is comprised of a single housing type with small amounts of
common open space (see Figure 4.1.201, Illustrative Standard Residential Neighborhood, below).
B. Minimum Design. New standard residential neighborhoods or residential subdivisions shall meet the applicable
requirements of Division 4.1.100, General Requirements for Development Design, and should be designed to be
compatible with existing homes, businesses, and neighborhoods, and with the natural characteristics of the area,
and the following.
1. Housing Types. New standard residential neighborhoods are limited to single-family detached dwellings.
2. Open Space. Open space is generally utilized for bufferyard, recreation, and drainage purposes.
a. If a standard neighborhood exceeds 150 units, it shall be designed as multiple identifiable "neighborhoods"
with distinct boundaries.
b. Lots shall be configured so as to maximize the number of lots that are within 1,320 feet of useable open
space (e.g., park, trail, etc.), as applicable.
Figure 4.1.201
Illustrative Standard Residential Neighborhood
C. Application and Process. All applications for standard residential development require the submittal and approval of
a subdivision plat.
Sec. 4.1.202 Planned Residential Neighborhoods
A. Generally. As set out in Section 3.1.101, Residential Development, new planned residential neighborhoods offer
more flexibility in site design by combining smaller and averaged lot sizes combined with multiple housing types in a
planned community. These types of neighborhoods set aside more common open space, provide greater protections
of natural resources, and have potential for higher densities than standard residential neighborhoods. New planned
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 83
residential neighborhoods shall meet the applicable requirements of Division 4.1.100, General Requirements for
Development Design, and the following:
B. Clustered Neighborhood. On parcels proposed for development where the developer chooses to provide only
single-family detached housing on clustered lots, the following shall apply (see Figure 4.1.202A, Illustrative Planned
Residential Clustered Neighborhood, below).
1. Natural Resource Protection. The development must protect and preserve existing natural resources including
wetlands, streams, floodplains, as required by Article 4.3, Environmental Quality and Resource Protection. The
open spaces should be located so as to maximize protection of the natural resources, including mature tree
stands, if present, and to provide continuous open space corridors and natural drainage areas.
2. Stormwater Management. Storm water management facilities should be designed using low impact
development best management practices so that these areas are amenities to the subdivision.
3. Other Required Areas of Open Space. Other areas of open space shall be integrated into the development design
so as to bring access to significant open space to the maximum number of properties; provided, however, that
physical access may be limited if such limitation would material enhance natural resource management.
4. Dwelling Units. Dwelling units on clustered lots shall be set back from the perimeter of the parcel at least the
following distances:
a. One to four lots: as required for individual lots;
b. Five to 20 lots: 75 feet; or
c. 21 or more lots: 100 feet.
5. Lots. Lots shall, where appropriate, be adjacent to or in near proximity to the following:
a. An amenity such as a park or greenway;
b. An existing or restored resource such as a meadow, woodlands, floodplains, watercourse or waterbody.

Illustrative Planned Residential Clustered Neighborhood
C. Mixed-Housing Neighborhood. On parcels proposed for development where the developer chooses to provide more
than one housing type (e.g., single-family detached and single-family attached housing) and areas of common open
space are the organizing feature, the following shall apply (see Figure 4.1.202B, Illustrative Planned Residential
Mixed-Housing Neighborhood, below).
1. Natural Resource Protection. The development must protect and preserve existing natural resources including
wetlands, streams, floodplains, as required by Article 4.3, Environmental Quality and Resource Protection. The
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 84
open spaces should be located so as to maximize protection of the natural resources, including mature
woodlands, if present, and to provide continuous open space corridors and natural drainage areas.
2. Connectivity. Streets should continue to neighboring properties so as to provide a continuous street network so
that traffic does not have to return to collector or arterial streets to move between residential areas. Cul-de-sacs
should not be used that will reduce access to abutting properties unless there are physical barriers (e.g.,
floodways, Interstate, etc.) that make such connectivity impracticable.
3. Access. Lots shall take access to an interior street, alley, parking court, or shared driveway. If a perimeter street is
also a minor residential street, lots shall front on the perimeter street and may take access from it if the lots
across the street also take access from the street.
4. Compatibility with Abutting Housing. Where a planned neighborhood abuts, is adjacent to, or is located across a
minor residential street from existing housing, the housing types that are nearest or across the street shall be
comparable to the existing housing types in terms of the housing type, scale, and method of access.
5. Separation of Housing Types.
a. Single-Family Detached Housing. Where single-family detached housing abuts single-family attached dwelling
units on the same parcel proposed for development, a Type A bufferyard shall be used to provide for
enhanced compatibility between the single-family detached dwellings and other housing types.
b. Single-Family Attached Housing. Different forms of single-family attached housing types (e.g., duplexes,
triplexes, townhouses), should be integrated together (without a bufferyard), as opposed to located within
separate, disconnected pods.
c. Off-Site Residential Uses. New single-family attached dwellings shall be separated by a Type B bufferyard, or
a district bufferyard, whichever is greater, from areas of single-family detached housing located in abutting
off-site development.

c. The maximum residential gross density for multi-family or mixed-use buildings (mix of residential and
nonresidential in the same structure) shall be based on the floor area ratio (FAR) set out in Table 3.1.201A,
Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Development Standards.
d. The presence of a home occupation or home-business in conjunction with a residential use does not count
towards the mixed-use or nonresidential minimum requirements set out in Subsection C.3., above; however,
live-work units shall be counted as part of the nonresidential and/or mixed-use calculations specified in
Subsection C.3., above.
5. Pedestrian Circulation, Walkways, and Trails.
a. A pedestrian circulation system shall be included in a mixed-use planned residential neighborhood in the DN
and MU district, respectively, and should be designed to ensure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily
throughout the development, without having to walk or utilize the street for travel. The pedestrian system
should provide connections between properties and activities or special features within common areas and

ARTICLE 4.2 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING
Division 4.2.100 Parking and Loading
Sec. 4.2.101 Required Parking Spaces
A. Generally. The City Commission has established that the orderly development and construction of parking lots is
both a continuing primary concern and necessity within the City limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ).
Therefore, all parking lots, parking aisles, parking spaces, and parking structures on parcels proposed for
development shall meet the standards of this Section and other applicable standards of Division 4.2.100, Parking and
Loading. The purpose of this Division is to establish standards ensuring the availability and safe use of parking lots.
B. Applicability of Division.
1. All new development shall provide all of the parking spaces required by this Section and shall comply with all
other provisions of this Division.
2. Expansions to existing development and changes in use of existing buildings that require additional parking shall
provide parking to the extent of the new demand created by the expansion or change in use.
3. Changes in use of existing buildings that result in a fewer required parking spaces shall not be required to
provide additional parking spaces.
C. Calculations. The number of required parking spaces is calculated according to the formulas set out in this Section,
which then may be adjusted per the standards set out in Section 4.2.103, Alternatives or Modifications to Required
Parking.
1. Variables for Calculating Required Parking. The variables used for parking calculations are measured as follows:
a. Per Square Foot (sf.) of Parking Floor Area (PFA). The phrase "per sf. of PFA" means that the number of
parking spaces is calculated based on the number of "parking-related" square feet of floor area put to the
use. The "PFA" is 85 percent of the gross floor area, plus (unless otherwise specified) the area of any parts of
the parcel proposed for development that are delineated and used in a manner that is comparable in
function and intensity of use to the use of the inside of the building (e.g., outdoor dining areas).
b. Per Dwelling Unit (DU) or Per Bedroom (BR). The phrase "per '#' DU" means that the number of parking
spaces is calculated based on the number of dwelling units. In some cases, the parking requirements are
based on the number of bedrooms (per "#" BR unit) in the dwelling units.
c. Per Bed. The phrase "per bed" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of beds in
the facility instead of the number of sleeping rooms or some other measure. Per bed calculations are
normally applied to uses that offer residential care or overnight accommodations with shared rooms.
d. Per Employee. The phrase "per employee" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number
of employees during the shift in which the maximum number of employees is present.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 100
e. Per Seat Capacity. The phrase "per seat" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of
seats that are provided for guests (patrons, members, etc.), with benches or pews measured as one seat per
each two feet of width; and
f. Per Square Feet (sf.) of Assembly Area. The phrase "per sf. of assembly area" means that the number of
parking spaces is based on the number of square feet in the largest room used for assembly (e.g., at a school,
this is often a gymnasium, but it could also be a theater or a lunch room).
g. Others. Other variables are measured according to their common meanings.
2. Rounding. If the final calculation of the number of required parking spaces includes a fractional space, the
number of required parking spaces is rounded up to the nearest whole number, regardless of the fraction.
3. Multiple Mixed-use or Nonresidential Uses. If several mixed-use or nonresidential uses occupy a single parcel or
building, the off-street parking and loading requirements shall be the cumulative total for all uses, or as set out in
Section 4.2.103, Alternate or Modifications to Required Parking, whichever is lesser.
D. Required Parking. The parking spaces required for individual uses are provided in this Subsection delineated by the
land use classifications set out in Chapter 2, Zoning Districts and Land Uses.

vans, SUVs, and light trucks may need a higher clearance. The applicant should note the maximum vehicle size to
be accommodated. All parking structure entrances shall have a clearly marked bar to alert oversized vehicles of
height limitations before they enter.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 106
2. Markings.
a. All parking spaces that are located in parking lots or provided on a street shall be clearly marked with either:
1. A single four-inch-wide contiguous line painted and maintained at the required stall width; or
2. A double four-inch-wide contiguous line painted and maintained with the midpoint of the two lines being
located at the required stall width.
b. All handicap accessible spaces shall be designed with an upright sign exhibiting the universal symbol for
accessibility by the handicapped. All such spaces shall be designed in compliance with the standards of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
c. Parking spaces for residential uses that are located in private garages, carports, or individual driveways do
not have to be marked. An area on a private residential lot is considered a parking space if:
1. The area is at least nine feet width by 20 feet stall depth in dimension;
2. The area does not encroach upon a public sidewalk;
3. The area has an improved hard surface; and
4. The area is accessible from the street.
5. Parking Module Standards. Table 4.2.102B, Parking Module Standards, sets out the minimum horizontal

4. Parking for Residential Development. The following types of vehicles are allowed in residential parking areas:
a. The outdoor parking or outdoor storage of not more than two recreational vehicles, campers or boats, or
trailers on property used for residential purposes, stored only in the side or rear yard and complying with the
following:
1. A recreational vehicle used for occupancy may be parked or stored outside a recreational vehicle (RV)
park so long as occupancy does not exceed seven days in any consecutive six-month period, and no
utilities are connected to the recreational vehicle and the vehicle is not parked on or extending over a
sidewalk or public property unless parked on the street in full compliance with the laws of the City.
2. An unoccupied recreational vehicle parked or stored on private property shall be set back a minimum of
25 feet from the front property line, inside any existing building lines, at least five feet from side and rear
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 108
property lines, and may not be on any easement or right-of-way. Any unoccupied recreational vehicles
parked or stored on private property shall be located on an improved hard surface.
b. The parking of one commercial car or truck not exceeding seven feet in height nor having more than one and
one half ton capacity as specified by the manufacturer, that is used in connection with the occupant's
business or livelihood.
c. The parking of passenger cars owned, leased, or otherwise in the name of the occupants of the dwelling and
their visitors.
G. Use of Required Parking.
1. Generally. Required off-street parking spaces shall be available for operable passenger automobiles of the
residents, customers, patrons, and employees of the use to which they relate.
2. Storage. Storage materials, boats, campers, recreational vehicles, or inoperable vehicles, or overnight parking of
trucks or trailers is prohibited in parking areas of multi-family, nonresidential, mixed-used, and
public/institutional developments, unless:
a. Outdoor storage is permitted by this UDC.
b. The area used for outdoor storage is not counted towards the minimum parking requirements for the use.
c. The area used for outdoor storage is in conformance with Section 5.2.104, Outdoor Storage and Display of
Merchandise.
3. Outdoor Display of Merchandise. The sale of goods or merchandise is prohibited in parking lots unless in
conformance with Section 5.2.104, Outdoor Storage and Display of Merchandise.
4. Prohibition. No area required by the City for the use of private, off-street parking shall be used as a commercial
parking lot.
H. Surfacing. All parking areas shall be graded and maintained so that water does not accumulate on such areas nor
flow or drain onto abutting public or private property. The surfacing of parking areas shall be as follows:
1. Paved Parking. Except as otherwise specifically required, all off-street parking and loading spaces together with
access and circulation drives, driveways, and parking aisles shall be surfaced or improved with asphalt, concrete,
or other such material approved by the Director of Public Works, that will provide an equal protection against
potholes, erosion, and dust.
2. Pervious Pavement. All development with paved parking shall be encouraged to use pervious pavement or
pervious pavement systems. From the standpoint of complying with Subsection H.1., above, pervious pavement
shall be considered "paved" if it complies with the following:
a. The pervious pavement or pervious pavement system shall be designed and certified by a registered
engineer or landscape architect to carry a wheel load of 4,000 pounds.
b. In nonresidential, mixed-use, and public/institutional developments, pervious pavement or pervious
pavement systems, except pervious asphalt or pervious concrete, shall not be used for access and circulation
drives, driveways, parking aisles, disabled parking spaces, or loading spaces.
c. Pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems that utilize turf grass shall be limited to overflow parking
which is not typically used on a daily or regular basis.
d. The use of pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems shall not count as landscape area nor allow
parking lots to be located anywhere not otherwise permitted by this UDC.
e. The use of pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems shall be prohibited in areas on a lot used for
the dispensing of gasoline or other engine fuels or where hazardous liquids may be absorbed into the soil.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 109
f. The use of pervious pavement or pervious pavement systems shall be adequately maintained so that the
specified level of perviousness continues overtime.
I. Maintenance. Access and circulation drives, driveways, parking aisles, off-street parking and loading spaces, and onsite
traffic directional or control devices shall be kept in good condition and parking space lines or pavement
markings on improved hard surfaces shall be kept clearly visible and distinct.
Sec. 4.2.103 Alternatives or Modifications to Required Parking
A. Generally. This Section sets out several ways to modify or reduce the number of off-street parking spaces that must
be provided by Section 4.2.101, Required Parking Spaces, under certain special circumstances.
B. Special Studies. Some of the uses that are listed in the tables set out in Section 4.2.101, Required Parking Spaces,
have nonlinear or widely varying parking demand characteristics. Accordingly, their parking requirements are listed
in the table as "Special Study." Required parking for these uses shall be established by special study according to the
standards of this Section. A special study shall also be required for any land use not listed in Section 4.2.101,
Required Parking Spaces.
1. Requirements.
a. The special study shall be conducted by a qualified transportation planner or traffic engineer at the
applicant's expense.
b. The special study shall provide:
1. A peak parking analysis of at least five comparable uses.
2. Documentation regarding the comparability of the referenced uses, including name, function, location,
floor area, parking availability, access to transportation network (including vehicular or other if
applicable), use restrictions, and other factors that could affect the parking demand.
2. Approval of Special Study. The City Commission upon recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission
may rely upon the special study to determine the minimum parking requirements.
C. Parking Credits and Reductions. This Subsection sets out credits and reductions in the number of off-street parking
spaces that are required. These credits or reductions are based on the provision of alternative parking or demand
management programs that tend to reduce the demand for parking. If used in conjunction with subsection D.,
Mixed-Use and Shared Parking, of this Section, these reductions may be applied to reduce the parking requirement
for the use prior to calculating the shared parking reduction.
1. Applicability to Special Studies. The credits and reductions are not available to uses that base their parking on a
special study, as set out in Subsection B., of this Section, unless the special studys methodology specifically
addresses these credits and reductions and determines that they are appropriate.
2. On-Street and Public Lot Parking.
a. Development within the Downtown "DT" district may provide on-street parking on streets internal to the
development (not on streets located along the exterior of the Downtown "DT" district). The parking on such
internal streets may be credited to particular uses in accordance with the formula: Parking Credit = (Sa x P),
where Sa = the area of the applicant's parcel divided by the area of the contiguous zoning district, and P = the
total parking that is available on-street in the district.
b. On-street parking spaces that can be accommodated along the front yard and street side yard of nonresidential
development, including live-work units within OT district may be applied to the minimum offstreet
parking requirement provided that:
1. Such parking spaces are legal parallel parking spaces;
2. More than half of the length of such parking spaces abuts the front yard or street side;
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 110
3. Location of such parking spaces does not result in traffic impediment;
4. Such parking spaces are marked by the property owner as per the requirement of Subsection 4.2.102.F.
Parking Space and Design Marking prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy;
5. Such parking spaces are available to the general public for parking.
D. Mixed-use and Shared Parking. The City recognizes that uses may have different hours of operation and peak
parking demand hours. For this reason, the City desires to encourage the sharing of parking for its potential to
reduce paved areas and/or to enhance the efficiency of land use. Where a mix of uses creates synergy with respect
to the use of parking spaces due to differences in when the spaces are most likely to be used, the Planning and
Zoning Commission and / or City Commission may reduce the required number of spaces according to the provisions
of this Subsection.
1. Shared Parking, Common Ownership. Shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of required parking
spaces when a parcel is occupied by two or more uses which typically do not experience peak use of parking
areas at the same time. When any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed below, the
minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedures:
a. Multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use, excluding spaces reserved for use by
specified individuals or classes of individuals (e.g., spaces that are either posted "reserved," or secured
behind a gate), by the appropriate percentage listed in Table 4.2.103A, Mixed-Use and Shared Parking, for
each of the designated time periods.
b. Calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five time periods (columns). The minimum parking requirement is
the highest of these sums. Set out in Table 4.2.103B, Illustrative Shared Parking Credit Calculation, is an
example of how to calculate shared parking credits.
c. In general, the maximum reduction allowed shall be no more than 25 percent.

Sec. 4.2.104 Loading Spaces and Design
A. Generally. The required number and design of loading spaces for all nonresidential, mixed-use, and
public/institutional parcels proposed for development are set out in this Section.
B. Required Loading Spaces. The minimum number of loading spaces required are set out in Table 4.2.104, Required
Loading Spaces.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 112
Table 4.2.104
Required Loading Spaces
Gross Floor Area (square feet) Minimum Loading Spaces
10,000 sf. to 40,000 sf. 1
Over 40,001 sf. to 100,000 sf. 2
Over 100,001 sf. to 160,000 sf. 3
Each additional 60,000 sf. over 106,001 sf. 1 additional
C. Loading Space Design and Markings. Loading spaces shall be designed and constructed as follows.
1. Location. All loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building and / or use to be served.
Furthermore, loading spaces shall be designed such that they do not face or are not in direct public view of
residential uses or arterial streets.
2. Dimensions.
a. Minimum width of loading bay (side to side): 12 feet;
b. Minimum length of loading bay (front to back):
1. For semi-trailers: 60 feet;
2. All other loading spaces: 25 feet;
c. Minimum vertical clearance: 15 feet.
3. Use of Rights-of-Way. Where off-street loading spaces are required, at no time shall any part of a truck or van be
allowed to extend into a public right-of-way while the truck is being loaded and unloaded.
4. Design. Off-street loading spaces shall be designed to not conflict with the general circulation patterns on the
site, nor interfere with any fire exits or emergency access facilities to either the building or site.
5. Surfacing. The surfacing of all loading space areas shall be in conformance with Subsection 4.2.102H., Surfacing.
6. Buffering. Loading spaces and docks shall be located behind buildings and screened from view from abutting
properties and public right-of-way. Truck access and loading areas that are located between a principal building
and property that is used for residential purposes shall comply with the following additional standards:
a. The length of the loading area shall be screened by a bufferyard that has one level more opacity (e.g., from a
"Type B" bufferyard to a "Type C" bufferyard) than required by the "use" bufferyard, as set out in Subsection
4.4.301A.2., Use Bufferyards, and shall contain an eight foot tall masonry wall that is designed and
constructed with the same primary exterior finish materials of the principal building; or
b. The loading area is enclosed by a roof and a wall between the building and the property boundary line (i.e., a
"loading shed"). The buffer between the loading shed and the property boundary line may be reduced by one
level of opacity adjoining the loading shed, and may be the standard "use" bufferyard elsewhere.
D. Exemptions. The loading requirements of this Section may be exempted for good cause shown upon demonstration
by the applicant of a proposed use and the nature of its business and operations. However, as determined by the
Code Official, or upon request of the City Commission at the behest of the Code Official, it may be required of the
applicant to reserve sufficient land for loading space if there is a reasonable likelihood that the use or the nature of
the use could change in a manner warranting loading space.
E. Parking Structure.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 113
1. The perception of the bulk (or mass) of a parking structure as seen from the street shall be minimized by
orienting the structure so that its short dimension is along the edge of the street with the highest functional
classification upon which the lot fronts.
2. Parking structures and vehicle entrances shall be designed to minimize views into the structure from surrounding
and adjacent properties, streets, and sidewalks. Methods to help minimize such views may include, but are not
limited to landscaping, planters, masonry walls up to 42 inches in height, and decorative grilles and screens. The
frontage along the parking structure shall include street furniture at intervals of not more than 40 feet (see
Figure 4.2.104, Parking Garage with Screening).
3. Parking structures shall be architecturally consistent with exterior architectural elements of the principal
structure or adjacent buildings, including rooflines, facade design, articulation, modulation, and finish materials.
4. Parking structure facades shall have brick cladding or a combination of brick and other masonry and have
regularly spaced square or rectangular openings.
5. Security grilles for parking structures shall be architecturally consistent with and integrated with the overall
design. Chain link fencing is not permitted for parking structure fencing.
6. If retail or any other appropriate uses are incorporated into the facade of the parking structure, one or more of
the following devices shall be used to screen the view of parked cars:
a. Ornamental grillwork (plain vertical or horizontal bars are not acceptable);
b. Decorative artwork, such as metal panels, murals, and mosaics; and/or
c. Display windows for use by nearby merchants.

Division 4.2.200 Access Management and Circulation
Sec. 4.2.201 General Access and Circulation Requirements
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Division is to promote safe transportation facilities, improved mobility and access, and
increased business and/or land value in the City. Access management reduces the potential for accidents and
improves travel conditions by minimizing conflicts between through and turning vehicles. Research has shown that
accident rates increase consistently with an increase in the density of access points, while accident rates decrease
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 114
with the implementation of access management standards. Accordingly, access to collector and arterial streets shall
be managed according to the standards of this Division.
B. Degree of Compliance. If the width of a lot or other constraint prevents an individual access from being compliant
with Section 4.2.202, Access Spacing and Corner Clearance, then common access shall be provided via joint access
and/or cross-access easements according to the standards outline in Subsection G., below. Even if common access
does not achieve compliance with Section 4.2.202, Access Spacing and Corner Clearance, it shall be utilized if it
creates a wider spacing between access points than would be provided in the absence of common access.
C. Alternative Access for Corner Lots. Lots that abut intersections of arterial streets and minor residential streets shall
take access from the minor residential street if the access meets the corner clearance requirements of Section
4.2.202, Access Spacing and Corner Clearance.
D. Timing of Compliance with this Division.
1. New development and subdivision shall demonstrate compliance with this Division for each required
development approval.
2. Properties with access connections that do not meet the requirements of this Division shall be brought into
compliance to the greatest extent possible when modifications to the roadway are made or when a change in
use results in one or more of the following conditions:
a. Site plan review, subdivision plat, or development plat is required.
b. The site experiences an increase of 20 percent or greater in peak hour trips or 100 vehicles per hour in the
peak hour, whichever is less, as determined by one of the following methods:
1. An estimation based on the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (latest edition)
methodology for typical land uses, or
2. Traffic counts made at similar traffic generators located in the City, or
3. Actual traffic monitoring conducted during the peak hour of the adjacent roadway traffic for the
property.
3. If the principal activity on a parcel with access connections, that do not meet the regulations of this Division, is
discontinued for a period of one year or more, then upon establishment of any use, the parcel must comply with
all applicable access requirements of this Division to the greatest extent possible.
E. Application to State Streets. The standards of this Division shall apply equally to streets operated by TxDOT upon
execution of an agreement between the City and TxDOT delegating the TxDOT access permitting process to the City.
In the absence of such an agreement, TxDOT shall retain the responsibility for access permitting on TxDOT operated
streets.
F. Driveways.
1. Generally. Driveways shall be designed according to the standards of this Subsection.
2. Single-Family Detached, Duplex, and Single-Family Attached Dwelling Units. Driveway width shall be maintained
between the property line and the garage or carport opening, except that it may be expanded where a
turnaround is required by this UDC. Driveways that provide access to individual single-family detached, duplex,
or single-family attached dwelling units shall be a maximum of the following:
a. A single-width driveway running from the street access to a garage or other parking area shall not utilize
more than 15 percent of any front yard, except for front yards with a frontage of less than 70 feet in width, in
which case the maximum width of a single driveway shall be 11 feet.
b. A double-width driveway running from the street access to a garage or other parking area shall not utilize
more than 27 percent of any front yard, provided that the maximum width of a driveway shall not exceed 24
feet or 18 feet for lots with a frontage of less than 70 feet.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 115
c. A triple-width driveway running from the street to a garage or other parking area shall not utilized more than
33 percent of any front yard, provided that the maximum width of a driveway shall not exceed 30 feet in any
case, and shall not be permitted for front yards with a frontage width of less than 80 feet.
d. Circular driveways shall not utilize more than 30 percent of any front or street side yards with a front of less
than 80 feet in width.
3. All Other Uses. Driveways that are not subject to Subsection F.2., above, shall be at least 25 feet wide, but not
more than 45 feet wide (at the property line), and configured to direct traffic safely into and out of the parcel
proposed for development. Such configuration may require median separation between ingress lanes and egress
lanes.
G. Cross-Access Easements.
1. Generally.
a. Access that is shared by abutting properties, whether under single or separate ownership, shall be preserved
using an appropriate legal instrument that is approved by the City Attorney and recorded in the public
records of Fort Bend County at the applicant's expense. The obligation to provide and maintain the crossaccess
shall run with the land. The Fort Bend County Clerk file number of the legal instrument shall be
referenced on any subsequent approved site plans or subdivision plats of the property.
b. If there is an existing shared access for which there is no recorded legal documentation, the shared access
shall continue and appropriate legal documentation shall be executed and recorded.
2. Terms. The City may require that common and cross-access easements include one or more of the following:
a. Sufficient width to accommodate a two-way access between properties, designed to accommodate
automobiles and emergency service, and loading vehicles.
b. Stub-outs and other design features to allow abutting properties to be tied in to provide future cross access.
c. Linkage to other cross-access drives in the area.
Sec. 4.2.202 Access Spacing and Corner Clearance
A. Generally. Access points include streets, alleys, driveways, and marginal access roads. Spacing of access points shall
be provided as set out in this Section
B. Measurements. Generally, the requirements of this Section are measured along the edge of the travel way, from the
closest edge of pavement of the first access connection to the closest edge of pavement of the second access
connection, including curb returns. This type of spacing is shown in Figure 4.2.202A, Illustrative Access Spacing and
Corner Clearance Measurements, as "spacing, opposite side."

opposite sides of arterial and collector streets shall be directly opposite each other or offset by a distance of at least
150 feet, unless a median or diverter prevents the potential conflicts.
E. Corner Clearance.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 117
1. The minimum corner clearance for access points is set out in Table 4.2.202B, Minimum Corner Clearance (see
Figure 4.2.202B, Illustrative Minimum Corner Clearance).
2. The distances that are set out in the table are minimums. Since site and intersection design must be considered
on an individual basis, greater clearance lengths may be required by the City Engineer if necessary to protect
public safety.
3. Shared access may be used to meet the requirements of this Section. If the dimensions of an existing lot and the
absence of a reasonable opportunity for shared access make compliance with this Subsection impractical, then
right-in, right-out access may be permitted at the farthest available point away from the intersection. For
example, a fueling station that cannot establish shared access with neighboring properties may be permitted to
have two right-in, right-out access points (one on each frontage), provided that they are located as far away from
the intersection as possible.

Sec. 4.2.203 Minimum Arterial Frontage
A. General. In general, the minimum arterial frontage that is required of lots that take direct access from an arterial of
any type shall not be less that that shown in Table 4.2.203, Minimum Arterial Lot Frontage, unless the new lots are
combinations of smaller lots or the subdivider provides for common access as set out in Subsection C., below.
B. Increased Frontage Requirement. A greater lot frontage may be required for driveways greater than 25 feet in
width, or development that requires more than one access connection to the arterial.
C. Decreased Frontage Alternative. Where subdivision results in lot frontages that are less than Table 4.2.203,
Minimum Arterial Lot Frontage:
1. A common area plan shall be provided during the subdivision process that shows common access locations and
dimensions and cross-access connections.
2. Common access easements and shared access driveways shall be provided, such that the standards of Section
4.2.202, Access Spacing and Corner Clearance, are met.
3. Legal instruments shall be recorded as set out in Subsection 4.2.201G, Cross-Access Easements.

Sec. 4.2.204 Modifications of Access Management Requirements
A. Generally. The access management requirements of this Division may be modified according to the standards of this
Section.
B. Reduction of Spacing Requirements. The spacing requirements of Section 4.2.202, Access Spacing and Corner
Clearance, may be reduced if an assessment of the individual safety and operational considerations of the proposed
connection so justifies, and:
1. Adequate access connection spacing cannot be achieved, but shared access is established with an abutting
property. A shared access agreement shall be required as set out in Subsection 4.2.201G, Cross-Access
Easements; or
2. No other alternatives exist, and construction of the access connection is along the property line farthest from the
intersection or closest access point. To provide reasonable access under these conditions, but also the safest
operation, consideration should be given to designing the driveway connection to allow only the right-in turning
movement or only the right-in / right out turning movements, if feasible. In such a case, the applicant shall also
demonstrate that:
a. The inability to meet the access spacing requirements was not due to the owner subdividing the property
after the effective date of this UDC without providing internal access;
b. The abutting landowner refused a request to provide cross-access; and
c. A covenant acceptable to the City Engineer to ensure that the connection will be provided and access will be
consolidated upon the earlier of:
1. Approval for development, substantial improvement, or redevelopment, of the abutting property, if
providing such connection is a requirement of the development approval; or
2. The applicant's parcel and the abutting parcel coming under common ownership.
C. Increase of Spacing Requirements. The City may require greater access spacing if the use will generate significant
truck traffic.
Sec. 4.2.205 Traffic Impact Study
A. Generally. New development, redevelopment, changes in use, or expansions to existing development that are likely
to result in additional peak hour or daily vehicular trip generation (compared to the existing condition) in excess of
the thresholds set out in Subsection B., below, shall submit a traffic impact study according to the methodologies set
out in Subsection C., below.
B. Thresholds. Traffic studies are required when any of the following thresholds may be exceeded on the parcel
proposed for development:
1. Additional average daily trips generated by the development exceed 500 trips per day, as determined by the
Planning and Zoning Commission;
2. Additional PM peak trips generated by the development exceed 100 trips per hour, as determined by the
Planning and Zoning Commission;
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 120
3. Any residential development that exceeds 150 new dwelling units;
4. The development is requesting access to an arterial street or state highway;
5. The development will cause the adjacent street or closest intersection(s) to operate at level of service (LOS) F; or
6. The adjacent street or closest intersection(s) already operates at LOS F.
C. Methodologies. Traffic studies shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer qualified to perform such work.
D. Updated Traffic Study Required. The Code Official may require an update (amendment) to a previous traffic study or
a new study if any of the following thresholds are met:
1. Changes to the development proposal increases expected trip generation for daily or peak hour trips by more
than 15 percent from the original study;
2. The previous traffic studies are more than two years old, unless the Code Official has determined that the
conditions have not significantly changed; or
3. Location, types and/or number of access points for the development has changed.
E. Conditions of Approval. The Planning and Zoning Commission may condition the approval of proposed development
on the maintenance of the level of service standards for streets that will be impacted by the development and may
authorize phased development that ties required street, intersection, access, signalization, or other improvements
(e.g., additional signage, pavement markings, acceleration/deceleration lanes, etc.) necessary to maintain LOS or
improve safety to the timing and level of development proposed for each phase.

ARTICLE 4.3 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND RESOURCE PROTECTION
Division 4.3.100 Open Space
Section 4.3.101 Use of Designated Open Space
A. Generally. This Section lists the uses that are permitted in the designated open spaces that are required elsewhere
in this UDC. If the use is located within a floodplain or floodway, then the standards of Division 4.3.200, Floodplain
Management and Flood Damage Prevention, also applies. These standards do not apply to open spaces that are

Division 4.3.200 Floodplain Management and Flood Damage Prevention
Sec. 4.3.201 Authority, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Interpretation, and Methods
A. Authority. Section 16.315, Tex. Water Code (the Flood Control Insurance Act) delegates the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations that are designed to minimize flood losses. The City Commission adopts this
Division pursuant to this grant of authority. The regulations of this Division are intended to set out requirements that
are not less stringent than those which are required for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
B. Findings of Fact. The City Commission finds that:
1. The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
2. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in
flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and
hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
C. Purpose. It is the purpose of this Division to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
1. Protect human life and health;
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense
of the general public;
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sanitary
sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in floodplains;
6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a
manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
7. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 126
D. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of the floodplain management regulations, all provisions shall
be:
1. Considered as minimum requirements;
2. Liberally construed in favor of the City; and
3. Deemed neither to limit or repeal any other powers granted under state statutes or the City's Home Rule
Charter.
E. Methods. In order to accomplish its purposes, this Division sets out regulations that:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive
increases in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved
in the accommodation of flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.
Sec. 4.3.202 General Provisions
A. Applicability. This Division applies to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City.
B. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in the current scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) for the City of Richmond, Texas," dated November 7, 2001, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps and/or Flood Boundary - Floodway Maps (FIRM and/or FBFM) dated January 3, 1997, and any revisions thereto
are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Division.
C. Establishment of a Floodplain Development Permit. A floodplain development permit shall be required to ensure
conformance with the provisions of this Division.
D. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance
with the terms of this Division and other applicable regulations.
E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This Division is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, conditions, or restrictions (CCRs). However, where this Division and another ordinance,
easement, covenant, condition, or restriction (e.g., a deed restriction) conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the
more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
F. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Division is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Division
does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free
from flooding or flood damages. This Division shall not create liability on the part of the City or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Division or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder.
Sec. 4.3.203 Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction
A. Generally. This Section sets out the general and specific standards for flood hazard reduction.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 127
B. General Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction. The requirements of this Subsection apply to all new construction
and substantial improvements in areas of special flood hazard.
1. Resistance to Hydrodynamic and Hydrostatic Loads. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
2. Construction to Minimize Flood Damage. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
3. Flood-Damage Resistant Materials. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage.
4. Protection of Building Service Facilities. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are
designed and / or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
5. Protection of Water Supply Systems. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
6. Protection of Sanitary Sewer Systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood
waters.
7. Location of On-Site Waste Disposal Systems. On-lot sanitary sewage disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
8. Limitations on Fill.
a. No fill shall be placed within a special flood hazard area unless the effect of the fill on water storage and
water quality is fully mitigated in one or more of the following ways:
1. Excavation of a volume of soil comparable to the volume that was filled to bring the surface of the land to
the base flood elevation. However, excavation is prohibited at depths that would be likely to:
a. Increase the velocity of stormwater flows;
b. Cause significant new erosion; or
c. Expose groundwater to contamination by pollutants which may be present in stormwater runoff;
2. A stormwater management system is installed or improved in a location and manner that compensates
for the removal of the filled area from the floodplain; or
3. If the compensatory storage is provided in the floodplain, the combination of filling, compensatory
storage, and detention is intended to lower the flood elevation by increasing channel capacity.
b. If fill is placed, the applicant shall provide a Hydraulics and Hydrology (H&H) study, which shall verify full
mitigation, or, alternatively, support a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).

inches above existing natural grade, whichever is highest; or
2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below an elevation that is at
least 18 inches above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
b. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications,
and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this Subsection.
c. A record of such certification which includes, if applicable, the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
4. Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;
b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 18 inches above grade; and
c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
5. Manufactured Homes.
a. Manufactured Homes in Zone A. All manufactured homes to be placed within special flood hazard area Zone
A shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this
requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces.
b. Manufactured Homes in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE. All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within special flood hazard area Zones A1-30, AH, and AE, on sites (i) outside of a manufactured
home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an

only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
D. Standards for Subdivision Proposals.
1. Generally. All subdivision proposals (including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions) shall
be designed in light of the findings of fact contained in Section 4.3.201B., Findings of Fact, and in a manner that
is consistent with Section 4.3.201C., Purpose, and Section 4.3.201E., Methods.
2. Permit Requirements. All proposals for the development of subdivisions (including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) shall meet Floodplain Development Permit requirements of Section
6.3.307, Floodplain Development Permit, and Division 4.3.200, Floodplain Management and Flood Damage
Prevention.
3. Generation of Base Flood Elevation Data. Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development (including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions) which
is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 4.3.202B.,
Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, and Section 6.2.202B.5.a., Floodplain Information and
Determination.
4. Adequate Drainage Required. All subdivision proposals (including the placement of manufactured home parks
and subdivisions) shall have adequate drainage (as specified in the City's drainage policy, promulgated by the City
Engineer) to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
5. Arrangement of Development. The standards of Chapter 3, Density, Intensity, Bulk, and Scale, allow for the use of
varied lot sizes and / or housing types in order to achieve the permitted density and protect the required amount
of open space. In the application of these standards, parcels proposed for development shall be located outside
of special flood hazard areas if possible.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 130
6. Modification of Open Space Ratio. Not less than 30 percent of the special flood hazard area of a parcel proposed
for development shall be protected as common open space. This area is counted towards the open space ratio
required by Section 3.1.101, Development Standards for New Residential Neighborhoods, then the larger open
space ratio applies.
7. Elevated Primary Access Required. The primary access to the subdivision (the access that connects to the highest
order street or that provides the most direct route to the largest number of lots in the subdivision, as
determined by the Code Official) shall be elevated to or above the base flood elevation to allow for access by
emergency vehicles.
8. Location of Public Utilities and Facilities. All subdivision proposals (including the placement of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions) shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
distribution systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
E. Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones).
1. Generally. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 4.3.202B., Basis for Establishing
the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, are areas designated as areas of shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist,
where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the provisions of this subsection shall apply.
2. Elevation of New Construction and Substantial Improvements (Residential). All new construction and substantial
improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to the highest
of the following:
a. 18 inches above the base flood elevation; or
b. the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified on the applicable FIRM; or
c. Two feet above if no depth number is specified.
3. Elevation of New Construction and Substantial Improvements (Nonresidential).
a. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to the highest of the following:
1. 18 inches above the base flood elevation; or
2. the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified on the applicable FIRM; or
3. Two feet above if no depth number is specified.
b. In the alternative to elevating the building, the building may be floodproofed such that, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, it is designed so that below an elevation that is 18 inches above the
depth number specified for the AO Zone, or below an elevation that is 18 inches above the base flood
elevation in an AH Zone, the structure is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
of effects of buoyancy. This option is allowed only if the Floodplain Administrator finds that the criteria for a
floodplain variance that are set out in Section 6.3.407, Floodplain Variances, are met.
4. Certification Required. A registered professional engineer, architect (for floodproofing options only), or
registered professional land surveyor (for building elevation options only) shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section are satisfied. See Section 6.3.307, Floodplain
Development Permit.
5. Drainage Paths. Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths around structures shall be provided on
slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 131
F. Floodways.
1. Generally. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 4.3.202B., Basis for Establishing the
Areas of Special Flood Hazard, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the
provisions of this Subsection shall apply:
2. Encroachments Prohibited. Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
3. Permitted Exceptions.
a. If Subsection F.2., of this Section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 4.3.202, General Provisions, and this Section;
and
b. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a
community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required
by § 65.12.

b. Transient vibrations of moving vehicles, such as trucks and automobiles or trains.
c. Agricultural equipment and operations.
d. Extraction activities may be granted limited exceptions to impact vibration standards during the limited or
conditional use approval process, and those conditions shall be controlling.
D. Smoke Emissions and Odors.
1. Generally. All uses shall comply with local, state, and federal regulations pertaining to the emission of smoke.
2. State and Federal Permits; Transfer of Pollution Rights. No regulated emission source shall be constructed or
operate without a valid permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Further, no transfer of
pollution rights authorized by the state or federal governments shall be permitted that would increase emission
levels within the City as a result of the transfer. Transfer of pollution rights out of the City are permitted and
encouraged.
3. Public Welfare. In addition to the standards specified below, emissions in such manner or quantity as to be
detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, comfort, or welfare is declared to be a public nuisance and
shall be unlawful.
4. Allowable Changes. Any prohibited use lawfully established prior to the effective date of this UDC shall be
allowed to be altered, or modified, provided that emissions conform to the standards established in this Section.
The total emission weight from all sources within the boundaries of the lot shall not exceed the net amount
permitted after an alteration or modification.
5. Heat. No use or activity in any district shall be so operated that it emits or transmits heat or heated air or water
so as to be discernible at or beyond the property line of the lot on which it is located.
6. Objectionable Odors. Any condition or operation which results in the creation of odors or hazardous emission of
such intensity and character as to be detrimental to the health and welfare of the public or which interferes
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 133
unreasonably with the comfort of the public shall be removed, stopped, or so modified as to remove such odors
or emissions.
7. Animal Odors. The environment they are kept in must be kept odor free from neighboring properties.
8. Smoke. The emission of more than 10 smoke units per hour per stack is prohibited, including smoke of a density
in excess of Ringelmann No. 1. of the Ringelmann Smoke Chart. However, once during any six-hour period, each
stack may emit up to 20 smoke units, not to exceed Ringelmann No. 1 when blowing soot or cleaning fires. Only
during fire-cleaning periods, however, shall smoke measuring of Ringelmann No. 2 be permitted, and then for
not more than four minutes per period.
9. Dust. Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such sources as storage areas, yards, roads,
and so out within lot boundaries shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, or other
acceptable means. Emissions from other sources in excess of the weight limitations specified hereinafter for the
district in which such use shall be located is prohibited.
E. Dust and Debris. Uses shall be maintained in an orderly condition and conducted in a manner that avoids the spread
of dust, debris, and litter to other properties and public rights-of-way. Hazardous materials, refuse, or items that can
be carried away by wind or water shall be secured in buildings, structures, or other such enclosure.
F. Toxic or Noxious Matter. No use shall for any period of time discharge across boundaries of a lot line on which it is
located, toxic or noxious matter in such concentrations as to be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
comfort, or welfare, or cause injury or damage to persons, property, or the use of property or land, or render
unclean the waters of the state to the extent of being harmful or inimical to public health, animal or aquatic life, or
the use of such waters for domestic water supply, recreation, or other legitimate and necessary uses. Disposal of
toxic or hazardous waste within the City is specifically prohibited.
G. Nuclear Radiation. Any operation involving radiation (i.e., the use of gamma rays, x-rays, alpha and beta particles,
high speed electrons, neutrons, protons, and other atomic or nuclear particles), shall be permitted only in
accordance with state and federal laws, rules, and regulations, or any other applicable regulation.
H. Electromagnetic Radiation and Interference. No person shall operate or cause to be operated for any purpose a
planned or unplanned source of electromagnetic radiation which does not comply with the current regulations of
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding such sources of electromagnetic radiation. No use, activity,
or process shall be conducted which produces electromagnetic interference with normal radio or television
reception.
I. Heat or Glare.
1. Generally. Any activity producing heat or glare shall be carried on in such a manner that such heat or glare is not
perceptible at any lot line. Exposed sources of light, including bare bulbs and tubes and immediately adjacent
reflecting surfaces, shall be shielded to avoid creating a nuisance across lot lines. The light intensity from
illumination of any kind shall not exceed fifty-foot lamberts at any point along the line of the lot containing the
light source.

Division 4.3.400 Grading, Erosion, and Stormwater Management
Sec. 4.3.401 Best Management Practices and Low Impact Development
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 134
A. Best Management Practices. The City requires Best Management Practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or
facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or
waters of the United States.
1. Structural and Non-Structural BMPs. Structural and non-structural BMPs shall require the following:
a. That a commercial or industrial establishment's owner or operator shall provide, at their own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes in the municipal
storm drain system or watercourses.
b. That any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
is required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
2. NPDES Permit.
a. Authorization. The provisions of this Section shall be deemed compliant once all terms and conditions of a
valid NPDES permit is authorized. The NPDES permit shall be authorized to discharge storm water associated
with industrial activity to the greatest extend possible.
b. Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPP). Best Management Practices shall be part of a SWPP as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
3. Post-Construction Storm Water BMPs. Post-construction (permanent) storm water BMPs are generally divided
into two categories: treatment BMPs and source control BMPs.
a. Treatment BMPs. Post-construction treatment BMPs include a variety of alternatives generally categorized as
conveyance practices and storage practices (e.g., a grass swale, retention pond, or sand filter) that provide
treatment of the storm water runoff quantity and quality.
b. Source Control BMPs. Proactively controlling pollutants at their source is fundamental to effective storm
water quality. Typically, it is easier and more cost-effective to prevent storm water pollution than to remove
contaminants once they have entered the storm sewer system or receiving water. A good source control
BMP is one that is effective at stopping and/or redirecting pollutants prior to entering the storm sewer
system. A source control BMP can be a structural component of a planned site (e.g., a covered area for
material storage) or a procedural BMP. Procedural BMPs depend on behavior change accomplished through
public education, training, and development of standard operating procedures.
B. Low Impact Development. The following are techniques that can be used to minimize the impact of impervious
surfaces by reducing connected impervious surfaces to a minimum, thereby reducing the area and cost of mitigation
techniques:
1. Water Gardens. Convey drainage from rooftops or drives to water gardens. The water garden shall be
landscaped with natural vegetation that includes unmowed groundcovers and woody plants that can tolerate
periodic inundation. When conveying the roof runoff to open spaces with natural vegetation, care must be taken
to assure sheet flow, not channelized flow, to prevent erosion.
2. Rain Barrels or Cisterns. Rain barrels or cisterns can be designed into the buildings or yards so that roof runoff is
directed to these storage facilities and used for beneficial purposes such as lawn watering, vehicle washing, or
other non-potable purposes. A variety of commercial products are available for this purpose. Their installation
must be partly assured by the subdivider's surety.
3. Pervious Pavements. Driveway, parking areas, or sidewalks may be constructed from pervious concrete to
provide infiltration of runoff. Pervious concrete or asphalt is recommended for minor roads or heavily used
parking areas. Concrete or other containment structures that hold gravel or turf are recommended for driveways
or low use parking areas.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 135
4. Vegetated Swales. These shall be used unless the subdivider can show they are impractical or that the slopes
would result in erosion.
5. Swale Blocks. The swale block is installed at intervals along a vegetated swale to allow the water to build up into
a series of pools, slowing water flow and allowing the vegetation to assist in cleaning the water and settling out
solids. The blocks shall be slotted to allow them to drain down and have a notch to permit maximum flows
during the 50-year storm without overflowing the swale. The use of swale blocks slows flows and decreases
pollutant loading and the detention facilities shall be sized to account for the reduction in flows.
6. Curb and Gutter. Curb and gutter systems and their associated storm sewer system are undesirable because they
greatly increase peak discharge rate and prevent infiltration or treatment of storm water. Curb and gutter
systems shall be used only where needed to contain parking, when swales cannot safely convey the volume and
peak discharge rate of storm water without erosion, or where curbs are needed to contain parking on streets.
When roads transverse open space areas, curbs shall be removed. Streets can be narrowed and parking provided
in bays, allowing parking to be prohibited. This eliminates the need for curbs.
7. Curbs without Storm Sewers. Where curbs are required for parking containment, they should be designed with
slots or discharge sections to convey the storm water to swales.
8. Green Roofs. The use of green roofs, roofs that have been planted in vegetation, shall be strongly encouraged for
buildings with roof areas in excess of 40,000 square feet. These provide both stormwater storage and cleaning of
the water.
Sec. 4.3.402 Discharges
A. Generally. This Section applies to facilities which have storm water discharges associated with industrial and
construction activity.
B. Permit. Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) storm water discharge permit shall comply with all applicable provisions. The City shall require, in an
acceptable form, proof of compliance with said permit prior to allowing discharge to the MS4.
C. Access to Facilities.
1. Inspection.
a. The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this Division as often as
may be necessary to determine compliance with this UDC.
b. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry
into the premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives
of the authorized enforcement agency.
c. The facility operator shall allow the City ready access to all parts of the premises for the purpose of
inspection, sampling, examination, and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of NPDES
permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and
federal law.
2. Equipment Monitoring.
a. The City shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
b. The City has the right to require the land owner to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition
by the land owner at their expense.
c. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 136
3. Obstructions. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected
and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the land owner at the written or oral request of the City and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the land owner.
4. Delays. Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water
discharge permit and this UDC. A person who is the facility operator with the NPDES permit to discharge storm
water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement
agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity or required by this
UDC.
5. Refusal. If the City has been refused access to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged,
and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this UDC, or that
there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify
compliance with this UDC or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from
any court of competent jurisdiction.
D. Discharge Prohibitions. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharges into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses any materials, including but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or
contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than storm water.
1. Discharge Exceptions. Illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
a. The following discharges are exempt of discharge prohibitions:
1. Water line flushing or other potable water sources;
2. Landscape irrigation or lawn watering;
3. Diverted stream flows;
4. Rising ground water;
5. Ground water infiltration to storm drains;
6. Uncontaminated pumped ground water;
7. Foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater de-watering systems);
8. Crawl space pumps;
9. Air conditioning condensation;
10. Springs;
11. Non-commercial washing of vehicles;
12. Natural riparian habitat or wetland flows;
13. Swimming pools (if dechlorinated to less than one PPM chlorine);
14. Fire fighting activities; and
15. Any other water source not containing pollutants.
b. When discharges are specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect
public health and safety;
c. When verbal notification for dye testing is given to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of
the test; and
d. When non-storm water discharge is permitted under an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the
authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations,
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 137
and provided that approval by the City has been granted in writing for any discharge to the storm drain
system.
2. Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
a. The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is
prohibited.
b. The prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of
whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
c. A person is considered to be in violation of this UDC and Section, if the person connects a line conveying
sewage to the MS4, or allows the connection to continue.
Sec. 4.3.403 Notification of Spills
A. Notification, Generally. Notwithstanding other requirements of state or federal law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has
information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States, said person shall
take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.
B. Notification.
1. Hazardous Materials. Release of hazardous materials shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.
2. Non-Hazardous Materials. Release of non-hazardous materials shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in
person or by phone or electronic mail no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone
shall be confirmed by written notice and addressed and mailed to the City within three business days of the
notice.
C. Records. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial facility/operation, the
owner or operator shall retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. The on-site records shall be retained by the facility/operation for at least three years.
Sec. 4.3.404 Suspension of MS4 Access
A. Detection of Illicit Discharge.
1. Generally. Any person discharging to the MS4 is in violation of this UDC and may have their MS4 access
terminated if the termination abates or reduces an illicit discharge.
2. Notification. The authorized enforcement agency shall notify a violator of the proposed termination of the MS4
access.
3. Petition. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing for the
MS4 access.
4. Prior Approval. A person commits an offense, if the person who committed the offense reinstates the MS4
access to the premises terminated pursuant to this UDC, without prior approval of the authorized enforcement
agency.
B. Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The City shall, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters
of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 138
enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters
of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
Sec. 4.3.405 Watercourse Protection
A. Watercourse Protection on Properties. Every person owning property and/or property lessee through which a
watercourse passes shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris,
excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly prevent the flow of water
through the watercourse.
B. Watercourses and Structures. The property owner and/or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures
within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that these structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
C. Waterway and Watercourse Protection Requirements. Waterway and watercourse requirements shall include:
1. A temporary stream crossing installed and approved by the City or Fort Bend County Drainage District if a wet
watercourse will be regularly crossed during construction;
2. Stabilization of the watercourse channel before, during, and after any in-channel work;
3. All on-site storm water conveyance channels designed according to the criteria outlined in Stormwater
Management Handbook for Construction Activities Prepared by Harris County/Harris County Flood Control
District and City of Houston; and

Sec. 4.3.406 Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
A. Generally. An erosion and sediment control plan, shall be submitted with each application for a site development
plan which involves land-disturbing activity which disturbs five acres or more of land. The Director of Public Works
shall have the authority to waive any of the requirements for the plan if the requirement is not necessary to control
erosion due to the nature of the lot or parcel proposed for development or the type of development proposed.
B. Erosion and Sediment Control Plan Required. An erosion and sediment control plan is required pursuant to this
Section and shall contain the following:
1. A plan prepared by a Texas Licensed Professional Land Surveyor, Engineer, Architect or Landscape Architect.
2. A plan drawn to a scale adequate to clearly show the parcel proposed for development and the required
information.
3. The plan may incorporate one or more sheets as necessary to clearly convey its intent. The plan may also
incorporate text to explain any specifics, cover the specifications for the materials required, or explaining
development phasing.
4. A construction sequence for the parcel proposed for development shall include:
a. Stripping and clearing;
b. Rough grading;

ARTICLE 4.4 TREE PRESERVATION, BUFFERING, AND LANDSCAPING
Division 4.4.100 General Requirements
Sec. 4.4.101 General Requirements
A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Article is to establish tree preservation, buffering, and landscaping
standards that protect and preserve the appearance and character of the City, protect the health and quality of life
of the residents through the preservation of protected trees, and conserve scarce water resources by promoting the
planting of native and drought-resistant trees and shrubs. In establishing these standards, it is the City Commission's
intent to encourage the preservation of trees and their value to the community, increase the compatibility of
abutting uses, and to minimize the effects on the surrounding environment due to noise, dust, debris, artificial light
intrusions, and other impacts of an abutting or nearby use.
B. Applicability of Standards. This Article applies to all new development, redevelopment, and substantial
improvements in the City and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), and where specifically indicated, to existing trees and
landscaping.
C. Exemptions. The following are exempt from the standards of this Article:
1. Individual lots of record that are existing as single-family detached or attached dwellings, unless required by this
Article.
2. Modifications to nonresidential, mixed use, or public/institutional buildings where the building expansion or
redevelopment does not exceed the gross floor area of the existing building(s) by more than 10 percent or 3,000
square feet, whichever is less.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 141
3. Sites that are proposed for redevelopment or substantial improvement, where due to the geometry of the site or
existing improvements, installation of landscaping in compliance within this Division would be impractical or
unreasonable, in which case the Code Official may approve a lesser landscaping requirement, provided that the
reduction of landscaping standards is only the extent necessary to make the installation practicable. In no case
shall this exception be interpreted to lessen these requirements for reasons other than those provided. The Code
Official may forward such alternative plans to the Planning and Zoning Commission for their review and
approval.
D. Approved Plant Lists. Only plants set out in Appendix A, Approved Plant List, count towards the landscape
requirements of this Article. The use of native, disease- and drought-resistant varieties of plant materials is strongly
encouraged, and shall be addressed with the submittal of a schematic plan.
E. Required Biodiversity.
1. Generally. Diversity of the genus and species of trees and shrubs is required in order to prevent monocultures
which could result in large-scale losses in the event of disease or blight.
2. Standards.
a. Within each category of required landscaping (i.e., large trees, small trees, evergreens, and shrubs):
1. Not more than 40 percent shall be of any one genus; and
2. Not more than 20 percent shall be of any one species.
F. Water-Wise Landscaping.
1. Generally. The requirements of this Section are applied to the total area of a parcel proposed for development.
2. Plant Selection and Grouping Requirements.
a. Plants shall be selected based on their adaptability to the site. Native species shall be installed, or protected
and preserved when possible.
b. Not more than 50 percent of the trees and shrubs that are installed to meet the requirements of this Article
shall be classified as high water use. Plants or trees growing produce for human consumption are not
counted in this calculation.
c. Low water use plants (including grasses) are required in all areas that are less than eight feet wide or
otherwise difficult to irrigate and manage (unless such areas are characterized by hydric soils).
3. Mulch. Mulch or other water-saving treatments shall be used for all landscape planting areas in order to help
maintain soil moisture and inhibit weeds.
G. Size and Quantity Requirements.
1. All plant materials shall be of good quality, container grown or balled and burlapped in accordance with the most
current edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock.
2. Large trees shall be at least three inches caliper.
3. Small trees shall be at least two inches caliper.
4. Evergreen trees shall be six feet tall at the time of planting.
5. Shrubs shall be in five gallon containers at planting.
H. Maintenance.
1. Landscape areas and plantings required by this Article shall be maintained and all plant materials that die within
two years of planting shall be the responsibility and at the expense of the owner/operator to ensure
replacement.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 142
2. Irrigation systems shall be located outside of the public right-of-way and shall be maintained or replaced at the
owner's expense.
3. The City may inspect each site after approval of a site plan, building permit, or issuance of the certificate of
occupancy and periodically thereafter to ensure compliance with the Article.
I. Required Warranty.
1. Generally. Landscaping that is installed or protected according to this Article shall be guaranteed according to the
standards of this Section. This warranty is in addition to the maintenance of the landscaping shown on an
approved landscape plan, as required by Section 4.4.102, Plans Required.
2. Required Warranty.
a. Term. The owner shall guarantee all plant material to be in healthy condition (free of dead or dying branch
tips; bearing foliage of normal density, size, and color; and closely matching adjacent specimens of the same
species) for a term of two years. The warranty term commences on the date of acceptance of installed plant
materials. When work is accepted in parts, the warranty terms extend from each acceptance to the terminal
date of the guarantee of the last acceptance.
b. Guarantee. During the required warranty term, the owner shall replace, without cost to the City, all plants
determined to be dead or in an unacceptable condition. Replacements shall be made within 30 days.
Replacements shall meet the minimum specifications of the materials replaced.
c. Extension of Warranty Term. Replacement plants shall be guaranteed for a new warranty term according to
the standards of this Section. In the event that a replacement plant is not acceptable during or at the end of
said new warranty term, the Code Official may require that a different genus, species, or type of plant
material be installed.
Sec. 4.4.102 Plans Required
A. Tree Disposition Plan. This plan shall specify which trees on the development site or tract are to be relocated,
removed or replaced. For those that remain, the plan shall delineate the limits of all tree protected zones for trees
that are over 19 inches in diameter (or 60 inches in circumference) and that are on the list set out in Appendix A,
Approved Plant List. In addition, the plan shall also include delineation of easement locations, utility alignments, and
building and parking footprints.
B. Landscape Plan. Compliance with the standards of this Section shall be demonstrated by development and submittal
of a schematic landscape, buffer, and irrigation plan, as follows:
1. Landscape Architect Required. Landscape plans for nonresidential, mixed-use, multi-family, and
public/institutional development shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect who is licensed to
practice in the State of Texas. Based on the volume of required planting, need for tree preservation and any
other site-specific issues pertaining to landscaping, the Code Official is authorized to allow submittal of landscape
plans prepared by other design professionals such as architects, engineers, or landscape professionals for
projects that meet the following two criteria:
a. New development projects with site area not greater than 0.5 acres; and
b. Redevelopment projects with site area not greater than one acre.
2. Contents of Schematic Plan. The plan shall include the elements that are set out in this Section. The Code Official
may waive elements of the plan if they are found that they are unnecessary due to the type of development
approval sought, or the conditions of the site being developed, or both. The Code Official is authorized to require
additional information on the plan, as needed, to administer the requirements of these regulations. The
schematic landscape, buffer, and irrigation plan shall include all of the following information:
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 143
a. Plan Drawing. A plan view, drawn to scale, that shows:
1. The location, species, and size of each plant, showing the anticipated canopy or spread of the plant five
years after installation;

[Ord. # 2018-11, 08/20/2018]
Effective on: 8/20/2018
Division 4.4.200 Tree Preservation and Protection
Sec. 4.4.201 Purpose and Application
A. Purpose. The City lies in Fort Bend County, the beauty of which is greatly enhanced by the presence of a large
number of mature trees. Development will invariably result in the removal of trees. Uncontrolled and an
indiscriminate destruction of trees would detrimentally affect the quality appearance of the natural environment
and the aesthetic value and enjoyment for the citizens of Richmond. The preservation program outlined in this
Division contributes to the preservation of the natural beauty and aesthetics of the community, and is for the
purpose of retaining the great historical and environmental value of these trees.
B. Application.
1. Required. This preservation program applies to new development, redevelopment, and substantial improvement
of multiple-family, nonresidential, mixed-use, and public/institutional land uses, as well as new subdivisions
within the corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of Richmond.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 144
2. Exempt. The following are exempt from the provisions and requirements of this Division:
a. Individual lots of record that are existing as single-family detached and attached dwellings in an improved
subdivision;
b. Multiple-family, nonresidential, mixed-use, and public/institutional land uses that are not undergoing
redevelopment or substantial improvement;
c. Non-protected trees, including:
1. Trees that do not exceed 19 inches in diameter (or 60 inches in circumference) when measured at a point
four and one-half feet above the tree's natural grade on an undeveloped tract of land; and
2. Trees that are not listed in Appendix A, Plant Lists.
d. Damaged Trees, including those:
1. Damaged by thunderstorms, windstorms, floods, fires or other natural disasters, and determined to be
dangerous by a peace officer, firefighter, or code enforcement officer in their official capacity. The Code
Official shall be promptly notified of the nature of the emergency and action taken.
2. Trees damaged by disease or rot, which are deemed to be a hazard by the Code Official.
e. Emergency Situations. Trees that require removal by fire, police, or other emergency services personnel
actively engaged in fighting a fire or other emergency services response.
f. Nurseries / Greenhouses. Trees planted, grown and/or held for sale as part of a licensed nursery /
greenhouse, retail or wholesale business. This exemption is limited to trees with main trunks under 10 inches
in diameter.
g. Public Utility Easements. Trees located within public utility easements; provided that the trees are interfering
with the safe provisions of these utility services.
Sec. 4.4.202 Permit Required
No person shall relocate, remove, or encroach into the protected root zone of any tree on any public or private property
unless a valid tree permit has been issued by the Code Official. Before a permit can be issued, a tree survey shall be
provided as set out in Section 4.4.204, Tree Survey Required. A development application involving a portion of a parcel
proposed for development may be based on a survey showing only that portion of the parcel proposed for
development. The Code Official may require an applicant to provide aerial photograph interpretation of the site for
preliminary analysis of large-scale developments. Approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission must be obtained to
cut, remove, or relocate any mature tree with a diameter or 19 inches or a circumference of 60 inches or larger. A
variance request shall be granted or denied by the City Commission.
Sec. 4.4.203 Protected Trees
A. Generally. This Division applies to the protection of existing trees on parcels proposed for development, excluding
those on individual single-family detached or attached lots that are exempted in Section 4.4.201, Purpose and
Application.
B. Protected Individual Trees. The following trees are protected, and shall be preserved and maintained according to
the standards of this Division:
1. Any tree with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 19 inches or a circumference of 60 inches or more.
2. Any tree that is shown on an approved landscape plan that is necessary to:
a. Meet the buffering and landscaping requirements set out in this Article; or
b. Meet a condition of approval of the development to which the landscape plan applies.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 145
3. Any tree with a DBH of eight inches diameter or 25 inches circumference or more on a property which is:
a. Designated as a historic landmark; or
b. Within the Historic Overlay (HD) District.
C. Protected Stands of Trees. Development shall be designed so that existing stands of trees are preserved in
designated open spaces, whenever, practicable. In general, alternative development options are available to
facilitate such designs.
Sec. 4.4.204 Tree Survey Required
A. Generally. A tree survey performed by a certified arborist, registered landscape architect, or a registered land
surveyor shall be submitted prior to any new development that is proposed where a landscape plan is required that
would impact a protected tree.
B. Tree Survey. The tree survey shall address the location, species, size, and condition of all protected trees.
C. Partial Tree Survey. The City may accept a partial tree survey in lieu of a full tree survey if the Code Official finds that
protected trees only exist on a portion of the site.
D. Tree Inventory Alternative. The City may accept a tree inventory in lieu of a tree survey if protected trees are
located in areas of designated open space.
Sec. 4.4.205 Limitation on Tree Removal
A. Clear Cutting. Parcels proposed for development that include stands of trees shall not be clear cut in preparation for
development. Development shall be designed to preserve existing stands of trees unless:
1. No reasonable alternative site design at the same density and intensity could be approved that would, in
descending order of priority, preserve:
a. All of the trees in the stand;
b. The largest of the trees in the stand; or
c. A greater number of trees than the landscape plan shows as protected; and
2. Relocation of the largest of the protected trees to another location on-site or within the City is not practical or
economically feasible.
B. Designated Areas for Tree Removal. Tree removal is allowed in the following areas of a parcel proposed for
development:
1. In, and within 10 feet of, an approved building footprint or approved manufactured home space;
2. Within clear areas of sight distance triangles or sight distances (see Section 4.5.102, General Street Standards,
Subsection D., Sight Distance Triangle Requirements) for public safety, or in adjacent areas if removal is
necessary to maintain the clear areas;
3. Within eight feet of an approved outdoor recreation area that by its nature requires the removal of the trees
(e.g., ballfields);
4. Within an approved stormwater retention/detention area, if the trees are not adapted to such conditions; and
5. Within six feet of a utility easement, if the trees would interfere with the use of the easement.
C. Individual Tree Removal in Other Areas. No individual protected tree shall be removed unless it meets one of the
criteria below:
1. The tree is infected with an epidemic insect or disease where the recommended control is not applicable and
removal is the recommended practice to prevent transmission.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 146
2. The tree poses an extreme public nuisance because of its species, size, location, or condition. The nuisance could
be caused by fruit or seed drop, harboring of insects, or excessive twig or limb breakage.
3. The tree poses a severe safety hazard that cannot be corrected by pruning, transplanting, or other treatments.
4. The tree severely interferes with the growth and development of a more desirable tree.
5. The aesthetic value of the tree is so low or negative that the site is visually enhanced by the tree's removal.
6. No reasonable alternative site design at the same density and intensity could be approved and relocation of the
protected tree to another location on-site or within the City is not practical or feasible for the survival of the tree.
Sec. 4.4.206 Tree Replacement Standards
A. General.
1. Protected trees shall not be removed, damaged (e.g., through topping or other improper pruning), or destroyed
unless a tree removal permit is issued by the City (see Section 6.3.303, Tree Removal Permit).
2. If a protected tree that is shown on an approved landscape plan (see Section 4.4.203, Protected Trees) is
removed for any reason set out in Section 4.4.205, Limitation on Tree Removal,Subsection C., it shall be replaced.
3. If a protected tree that is shown on an approved landscape plan (see Section 4.4.203, Protected Trees) is
removed in violation of this UDC, the value of the tree removed (as determined by a certified arborist) will be
assessed, and it shall be replaced according to the schedule in Table 4.4.206, Tree Replacement Standards, unless
the certified arborist determines that there is insufficient room for healthy tree growth.
4. Trees that are not protected by Section 4.4.203, Protected Trees, may be removed, subject to the limitations of
Section 4.4.205, Limitation on Tree Removal, upon issuance of a building permit.
B. Relocation. Protected trees that are relocated to another place on the parcel proposed for development do not have
to be replaced if they are relocated according to industry standard transplanting methods, as approved by a certified
arborist.
C. Development. Protected trees may be removed from a parcel proposed for development if it is demonstrated that:
1. There is no reasonable alternative site design at the same density and intensity that could be approved and
relocation of the protected tree to another location on-site or within the City is not practical or feasible for the
survival of the tree; and
2. The trees are replaced or mitigated according to the replacement standards in Table 4.4.206, Tree Replacement
Standards.

D. Relationship to Other Landscaping Requirements. Replacement trees shall count toward the landscaping
requirements of the areas in which they are planted. However, if this Section requires more trees than the other
Divisions of this Article, then this Section controls.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 147
E. Timing of Replacement. Replacement trees that are required by this Section shall be installed within 30 days of
removal.
Division 4.4.300 Buffering
Sec. 4.4.301 Buffering
A. Generally. The bufferyards required between areas of different uses that are required by this UDC are based on the
amount of screening (i.e., opacity) they provide. Bufferyards are classified from less screening (Type A) to more
screening (Type D).
B. Bufferyard Classifications. There are two bufferyards options. Landscape only bufferyards are the preferred option
and use a higher density of plant material to screen abutting properties. For properties more constrained by size, a
second option provides a similar level of screening, but allows a berm, wall, or fence to be used in conjunction with a
smaller width of landscape strip and lower density plant material. Each option identifies the width of the buffer and
the numbers and types of plants required per 100 linear feet, or portion thereof. The minimum planting
requirements for each type and composition of bufferyard are set out in Table 4.4.301A, Bufferyard Classifications.

Type D (65%) 25' 3 5 5 25 3' berm
TABLE NOTES:
N/A - Not Applicable.
1 A berm, wall, or fence is not required for landscape only bufferyards.
2 Plant material, except large trees, must be installed on the outside of the wall or fence facing the street or abutting properties.
C. District Bufferyards. Set out in Table 4.4.301B, District Bufferyards, are the required bufferyards between properties
(delineated by zoning districts) that are not separated by a public or private street. Landscaping along property lines
that are bordered by a public or private street are subject to the landscaping requirements set out in Division
4.4.400, Landscaping. The rows show the zoning of the parcel proposed for development and columns show the
zoning of the abutting land. Two letters are shown for each condition. The bufferyard required for the parcel
proposed for development is listed first. The letter listed second is the buffer that is or may be required on the
abutting property when it is developed, redeveloped, or substantially improved in the future. Where "-" is found
there is no use bufferyard required.

D. Existing Abutting Development without Bufferyards. Where the abutting property is an existing single-family
detached, duplex, or other single-family attached residential property or existing development that does not have
the required bufferyard, the proposed mixed-use, nonresidential, multi-family, or public/institutional development
shall provide a bufferyard of the next higher classification (e.g., if the requirement is a Type B bufferyard, then the
screening of the parcel proposed for development shall be a Type C bufferyard).
E. Maintenance. Street trees required by this UDC shall be maintained by a developer, lot owner/operator, tenant,
property owners' association or other entity having a legal interest in the ownership of the subdivision, or lots in the
subdivision, or development. When the developer prepares the subdivision's covenants, conditions, and restrictions,
the maintenance responsibilities shall be included designating lot owner/operator or the property owners'
association responsibility.

Figure 4.7.202B
Electronic Message Center Orientation
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 182
a. Placement. Electronic message centers shall be placed with consideration of the impacts on abutting or
adjacent residential districts and uses. In all cases, and to the maximum extent practicable, electronic
message centers shall be located at a point with the greatest dimension and separation from the property
line of a residential use or the boundary line of a residential district.
b. Design. In addition to the standards of this Section, the design of electronic message centers may help to
eliminate or, at a minimum, mitigate their impacts. The alternative orientations are illustrated in Figure
4.7.202B, Electronic Message Center Orientation, which, in order of descending preference, include:
1. Electronic message center placed parallel to the street;
2. Double-faced electronic message center with the sign faces angled such that they are readable to passing
motorist but yet oriented so as not to cause visibility or glare; and
3. Electronic message centers placed perpendicular to the street.
c. Buffering. For angular, double-faced electronic message centers and those that are placed perpendicular to
the street, a Type A bufferyard is required whereby the required trees and shrubs shall create a visual buffer
to a minimum height of 12 feet.
d. Illumination. Illumination of electronic message centers shall be as set out in Section 4.7.203, Illumination of
Signs.

D. Requirements.
1. Operating Permit. An annual operating permit is required.
2. Public Nuisance. If the City finds that an electronic message center causes glare or otherwise impairs the vision of
the driver of a motor vehicle or otherwise interferes with the operation of a motor vehicle, the owner of the
message center, within 12 hours of a request by the City, shall reduce the intensity of the sign to a level
acceptable to the City.
E. Standards.
1. Lighting. Electronic message centers shall:
a. Not exceed 0.3 footcandles above ambient light when measured from a specified distance. This
measurement calculates the illumination of the sign and incorporates a scientific formula to ensure
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 183
consistency of the measurement when applied to electronic message centers of varying sizes and resolutions.
The instrument to measure the illuminance of electronic message centers shall be an illuminance meter more
commonly referred to as a lux or footcandle meter. The illuminance meter must have the ability to provide a
reading up to two decimal places and must be set to read footcandles. The method to calculate the
appropriate distance from which the illuminance shall be measured is the square root of the area of the
message center times 100.
b. Be equipped with a sensor or other device that automatically determines the ambient illumination and is
programmed to automatically dim according to ambient light conditions, or that can be adjusted to comply
with a maximum illumination of 0.3 footcandle over ambient light conditions.
2. Spacing. Message centers shall have a minimum spacing of:
a. 50 feet between the message center and the property line of any residential use or district. The distance shall
be calculated as the shortest measurable distance between the nearest point of the sign to the edge of the
residential property line or district or to the property line of an institutional use.
b. 400 feet between message centers on the same property, with a maximum of no more than two message
centers per any street frontage. The distance shall be calculated as the shortest measurable distance
between the nearest points of the signs.
c. 25 feet between a message center and an existing building. The distance shall be calculated as the shortest
measurable distance between the nearest point of the sign or sign element and the nearest point of the
existing building.
F. Manual Changeable Copy Message Centers. Manual changeable copy signs may be incorporated into signage as
follows:
1. Manual changeable copy reader boards are only permitted on monument signs or marquee signs which enclose
the message center component on all sides with a finish of brick, stone, stucco, powder coated metal, or the
surface of the sign face that extends not less than six inches from the message center in all directions. Gaps
between the changeable copy area and the surround are permitted to accommodate locks and hinges for a cover
for the changeable copy area, but only to the extent necessary for such locks and hinges to operate.
2. Manual changeable copy message centers, including their frames, shall make up not more than 30 percent of the
sign area. The balance of the sign area shall utilize permanently affixed letters or symbols (see Figure 4.7.202C,
Manual Changeable Copy Message Boards and Inserts).
3. Lettering of manual changeable copy signs shall be of a single style and shall be of uniform color and size.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 184
Figure 4.7.202C
Manual Changeable Copy Message Boards and Inserts
4. Manual changeable copy message centers shall not be internally lit unless:
a. They use dark colored opaque inserts with translucent light colored letters, numbers, or symbols (see Figure
4.7.202B, Manual Changeable Copy Message Boards and Inserts);
b. Dark colored blank opaque inserts that are the same color as the opaque portions of the letters, numbers,
and symbols are used over all areas of the sign where copy is not present; and
c. The opaque portion of the letters, numbers, and symbols is the same color as the opaque insert.

Table Notes
1. Highway and Interstate directional signs and City limit signs are within the jurisdiction of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
C. Off-Premises Signage.
1. Purpose. The purpose of this Subsection is to set out the provisions of state and federal law pertaining to both
on- and off-premise advertising signs along the state's primary highways, as well as to establish the regulation of
the City for these signs within the City limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ).
2. Application. Outdoor advertising signs along the state's primary highways are regulated by the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT), which includes signs:
a. Outside of the corporate limits of the City and more than 660 feet from the nearest edge of the right-of-way
of U.S. 59 (future I-69) or U.S. 90-A (defined as regulated highways) if any part of the sign's advertising or
information content is visible from the main-traveled way of the highway and the sign was erected for the
purpose of having its advertising or information content seen from the main-traveled way of the highway.
b. Inside the corporate limits of the City and within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way of U.S. 59
(future I-69) or U.S. 90-A (defined as regulated highways) if any part of the sign's advertising or information
content is visible from any place on the main-traveled way of the highway; or
3. Local Control. The Texas Department of Transportation may authorize the City to exercise control over outdoor
signs in its jurisdiction provided the City receives approval under Title 43, Transportation; Part 1, Texas
Department of Transportation; Chapter 21, Right-of-Way; Subchapter I, Regulation of Signs Along Interstate and
Primary Highways; Division 1, Signs; Rule §21.200 Local Control. Upon approval, the City would be listed as a
"certified city" and a permit issued by the City is acceptable instead of a permit issued by TxDOT within the
approved area.
4. Zoning. TxDOT will not issue a permit unless the sign for which application is made is located along a roadway to
which Transportation Code, Chapter 391, applies and is in:
a. An unzoned commercial or industrial area in the extraterritorial jurisdiction, as further described in
Subsection 5., below; or
b. A zoned commercial or industrial area, which is an area that is designated, through a comprehensive zoning
action, for general commercial or industrial use by the City who has the legal authority to zone. An area is not
a zoned commercial or industrial area if it is:
1. An area in which limited commercial or industrial activities incident to other primary land uses is allowed;
2. An area that is designated for and created primarily to allow outdoor advertising structures along a
regulated highway;
3. An unrestricted area; or
4. A small parcel or narrow strip of land that cannot be put to ordinary commercial or industrial use and
that is designated for a use classification that is different from and less restrictive than its surrounding
area.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 198
5. Land Use.
a. For the purposes of this Subsection, a commercial or industrial activity is an activity that:
1. Is customarily allowed only in a zoned commercial or industrial area; and
2. Is conducted in a permanent building or structure permanently affixed to the real property that:
a. Has an indoor restroom, running water, functioning electrical connections, and permanent flooring,
other than dirt, gravel, or sand;
b. Is visible from the traffic lanes of the main-traveled way;
c. Is not primarily used as a residence; and
d. Has at least 400 square feet of its interior floor space devoted to the activity.
b. The following are not commercial or industrial activities:
1. Agricultural, forestry, ranching, grazing, farming, and related activities, including the operation of a
temporary wayside fresh produce stand;
2. An activity that is conducted only seasonally;
3. An activity that has not been conducted at its present location for at least 180 days;
4. An activity that is not conducted by at least one person at the activity site, and that is not operated for at
least 30 hours per week and on at least four days per week;
5. The operation or maintenance of:
a. An outdoor advertising structure;
b. A recreational facility, such as a campground, golf course, tennis court, wild animal park, or zoo, other
than the related activities conducted in a building or structure and the parking facilities for that
building or structure;
c. An apartment house or residential condominium;
d. A public or private preschool, secondary school, college, or university, other than a trade school or
corporate training campus;
e. A quarry or borrow pit, other than the related activities conducted in a building or structure and the
parking facilities for that building or structure;
f. A cemetery; or
g. A place that is primarily used for worship;
6. An activity that is conducted on a railroad right of way; and
7. An activity that is created primarily or exclusively to qualify an area as an unzoned commercial or
industrial area.
6. Electronic Signs. An electronic sign may be located, relocated, or upgraded only along a regulated highway and
only where the City allows electronic signs under this Code, both within the corporate limits and extraterritorial
jurisdiction.
7. Changes, Additions, Relocation, and Reconfigurations Prohibited. The following are examples of changes to offpremise
signs that are specifically prohibited by this Article and for which a sign permit may not be issued:
a. Erecting or placing a new sign or sign structure;
b. Adding lights to a non-illuminated sign or adding more intense lighting to an illuminated sign whether or not
the lights are attached to the sign structure;
c. Adding permanent bracing wires, guy wires, or other reinforcing devices;
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 199
d. Changing the material used in the construction of the sign structure, such as replacing wooden material with
metal material;
e. Adding faces to a sign or changing the sign configuration;
f. Changing the height of the sign;
g. Changing the configuration of the sign structure, such as changing a "V-shaped" sign to a stacked or back-toback
sign, or a single face sign to a back-to-back sign; or
h. Moving the sign structure or sign face in any way.
(Ord. No. 2018-02, 07/16/2018; Ord. No. 2018-11, 08/20/2018)
Effective on: 8/20/2018
Division 4.7.400 Temporary Signs
Sec. 4.7.401 Standards for Temporary Signs by Type
A. Findings. The City Commission finds that:
1. There is a need and warrant for the display of signage on a one-time, limited duration, and/or intermittent basis
to aid businesses and other public or private entities in communicating a commercial message to their
customers, patrons, clients, or to the general public;
2. The regulation of temporary signage is a substantial governmental interest as means for preserving the quality
and integrity of the visual environs in a manner that reflects positively on the community and its attractiveness
as a place to visit and live; and
3. It is reasonable to regulate the number, size, height, location, and duration of signs that are placed on property
on a temporary basis so as not to devalue or to lessen the impact or importance of permanent signage.
B. Generally. This Section sets out which temporary signs are allowed in each zoning district, and the size, height,
placement, and timing standards that apply to them. Sign types that are not listed in Table 4.7.401, Temporary Sign
Types, are not permitted as temporary signs. Within the extraterritorial jurisdiction, this Section sets out which
temporary signs are allowed for "residential", "nonresidential", "public/institutional", and "mixed use" land uses, as
defined in Division 7.1.300, Definitions, as set out in Table 4.7.401, Temporary Sign Types. Such determination may
be made by the Code Official in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2.2.107, Unlisted or Functionally Similar Uses,
or at the Code Official's discretion, may be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a decision as to the
definition of land use.
C. Attention-Getting Devices. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 4.7.103, Prohibited Signs, Locations in Right-of-
Way, Design Elements, and Content; Exempted Signs, certain devices such as banners, advertising sails, flags,
pennants, streamers, and other attention-getting devices and community information signs or devices not otherwise
allowed, may be allowed on a limited basis, in number and time, for special or unique events such as grand
openings, special civic events, new businesses, and other similar events, subject to the following standards:
1. An operating permit and plan is required;
2. Such device may not be displayed for more than 14 days;
3. The number of items and devices shall be determined by the scope of the event and the size of the premises on
which devices may be safely placed;
4. Off-premise advertising may be allowed for non-profit civic events; and
5. The City banner fixture at Crawford Park is exempt and may display banners only.
D. Enforcement.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 200
1. Temporary signs that are installed improperly or illegally will be removed by the City and the violators will be
notified of such violation. If it is determined that the sign cannot be easily removed, the Code Official, or a
designee, will notify the offender of their temporary sign violation. Offenders will have two business days to
remove the sign. If the sign is not removed within this time period they are subject to a fine.
2. Temporary signs that have been properly permitted by the City will be issued a sticker, which shall be placed
by the applicant on the temporary sign on the same day the sticker is issued. This sticker will identify the date of
the sign permit and the date the temporary sign permit expires.
a. If a temporary sign is installed without a sticker, the sign is subject to removal by the City and the violators
will be notified of such violation.
b. If a temporary sign is in place after the date of expiration, as denoted on the sticker, the sign is subject to
removal by the City and the violators will be notified of such violation.
c. Violators will be notified of such violations and will be subject to the enforcement procedures and penalties
of this Code. Repeat violators will be submitted to the City Attorney for additional remedies.
E. Setbacks. All temporary signs shall be set back at least five feet from all property lines. Temporary signs not visible
from a public right-of-way or abutting property are not restricted by this Section.

Division 4.7.500 Sign Design Program
Sec. 4.7.501 Program Alternative
A. Generally.
1. Purpose. The requirements of Article 4.7, Signs, is to ensure that signs meet certain minimum standards that are
consistent with the character and quality of development in Richmond, which may be quickly approved and
displayed. For some development, alternative standards may contribute to the aesthetic qualities of the
development. Approval of a sign design program pursuant to the standards of this Division allows for unified
presentation of signage throughout a parcel proposed for development, flexibility to provide for unique
environments, and pre-approval of designs and design elements to make subsequent applications for sign
permits more efficient. To this end, a sign design program alternative is created.
2. Approval Criteria. The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve a sign design program if it results in a
substantially improved, comprehensive, and unified proposal compared to what is allowed through strict
compliance with the sign regulations of this Division. The Code Official shall review all sign types (e.g., attached,
window, etc.) for the parcel proposed for development, to determine the degree of compliance with this
Division, and shall report to the Planning and Zoning Commission with regard to the degree of deviation from
these standards that is sought by the applicant. The degree of deviation sought by the applicant shall be
measured against the degree of compliance with the standards of this Division.
3. Conditions of Approval. The Planning and Zoning Commission may impose reasonable conditions on the sign
design program that are not related to the content of the signs or the viewpoints of the sign users, in order to
ensure continuing compliance with the standards of this Division and approved sign design programs.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 210
B. Contents of Sign Design Program. A sign design program shall set out a master plan for signage for an entire parcel
proposed for development. For example, shopping center sign design programs shall include all tenants and lots; and
office or industrial parks shall include all types of signs for way-finding and tenants or uses within the development.
Sign design programs shall set out:
1. Sign dimensions and approximate locations;
2. Materials and colors;
3. Proposed illumination, including illumination levels;
4. Maximum numbers of items of information per sign face;
5. A design theme with illustrative examples of each sign type and the proposed general locations of each sign type;
and
6. A demonstration that the sign design program will improve the aesthetics of the development and will not have
an adverse impact on the use, enjoyment, or value of property in adjacent or nearby residential districts or uses.
C. Effect of Approval. Upon approval of a sign design program, issuance of a sign permit shall be based on compliance
with the standards set out in the sign program for the parcel proposed for development.
Sec. 4.7.502 Criteria
A. Generally. Signage which is proposed as part of a sign design program may deviate from the standards of this
Division in terms of the types and numbers of signs allowed, the maximum sign area, the maximum signable area
ratio, and materials and illumination standards (excluding electronic message centers), subject to compliance with a
sign design program that is approved according to the criteria set out in this Section.
B. Prohibited Signs and Sign Elements. Prohibited signs and sign elements are not eligible for inclusion in a sign design
program unless specifically indicated in this Section.
C. Modification of Sign Setbacks. Setbacks for freestanding signs may deviate from the requirements of this Section if it
is demonstrated that there is no impact on public safety or utility easements, and all other requirements for
approval of a sign design program are met.
D. Architectural Theme.
1. All signs shall be architecturally integrated into or complimentary to the design of the building and character of
the site, and shall use similar and coordinated design features, materials, and colors. The sign design program
shall establish an integrated architectural vocabulary and cohesive theme for the parcel proposed for
development.
2. The design, character, location, and/or materials of all freestanding and attached signs proposed in a sign
program shall be demonstrably more attractive than signs otherwise permitted on the parcel proposed for
development under the minimum standards of this Subsection.
E. Lighting. Lighting standards shall not deviate from the standards of this Subsection in locations where the lighting:
1. Cannot be seen from outside of the parcel proposed for development;
2. Does not create a sky glow under normal conditions; and
3. Does not shine into windows of residential units located within the district.
F. Height Area, Number, and Location of Signs.
1. The height, area, number, and location of signs permitted through the sign design program shall be determined
by the Planning and Zoning Commission based on the following criteria:
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 211
a. The overall size of the parcel proposed for development and the scale of the use or uses located or
anticipated to be located there (larger land areas and scales of use tend to favor larger signs and/or more
signs);
b. Relationship between the building setback and sign location (additional signage may be appropriate for
buildings with less visibility, particularly where buffering is providing an aesthetic and/or environmental
benefit to the City);
c. Frontage (larger frontages may justify more or larger signs, particularly, if the size of the frontage tends to
prevent sign clutter from multiple adjacent parcels);
d. Access and visibility to the site;
e. Intended traffic circulation pattern and the need for way-finding;
f. Hierarchy of signage;
g. Relationship between the site and adjacent uses;
h. The desired function of the site (e.g., an urban center or activity center would tend to include signage that is
more urban and more dynamic in character than a strip shopping center); and
i. Consistency with the objectives and design policies of the Comprehensive Master Plan and any applicable
sub-area plans.
2. Additionally, the maximum permitted sign area shall be based on the following formula when evaluated against
the above criteria:
a. The maximum area permitted for attached signage shall range from one percent up to a maximum of six
percent of the building façade to which the sign is to be attached.
b. The maximum total permitted area of all freestanding signs on a parcel proposed for development shall not
exceed 10 percent more than the total sign area that would otherwise be permitted by Section 4.7.302,
Nonresidential and Mixed-Use District Signs.
G. Community Character. The signage proposed in a sign design program shall not have an adverse impact on the
community character of the district in which the parcel proposed for development is located, or of the City.
H. Property Values. The signage proposed in a sign design program will not have an adverse impact on the value of
property in the immediate vicinity of the parcel proposed for development.
I. Elimination of Nonconforming Signs. If there are existing signs on-site, they shall be brought into conformance with
the standards of the approved sign design program.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 212

Division 5.1.300 Special District Design Standards
Sec. 5.1.301 Historic Overlay (HD) District Design Standards
A. Generally. The provisions of this Section apply to land, buildings, and structures within the City's Historic Overlay
District.
B. Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings. When considering applications for certificates of appropriateness
for new construction, alteration, repair, restoration, or demolition, the Historic Preservation Officer (HPO) and
Richmond Historical Commission (RHC) shall use the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Design
Guidelines, ratified by the City Commission in making their decisions. In addition, the Richmond Historical
Commission, with technical input and a recommendation by the Historic Preservation Officer, may adopt more
specific guidelines for the Historic Overlay District. These guidelines may serve as the basis for determining the
approval, approval with modifications, or denial of an application for a certificate of appropriateness.
1. Original Integrity Intact. New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a
manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.
2. Historic Context. New site construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that
characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the
historic materials, features, size, scale, and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and
its environment.
3. Archeological Preservation. Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources
must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.
4. Care in Treatment. Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used.
5. Restoration of Distinct Features. Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the
severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old design,
color, texture, and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by
documentary and physical evidence.
6. Preservation of Distinct Features. Distinct materials, features, finishes, and site development techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a site will be preserved.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 226
7. Appropriate Changes. Changes to a site that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained
and preserved.
8. Historic Integrity. Each site will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create
a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural site features or elements from other sites,
shall not be permitted.
9. Preservation of Historic Character. The historic character of a site shall be retained and preserved. The removal
of distinctive or alteration of site features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be
avoided.
10. Appropriate Use. A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal
change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.
C. Minimum Maintenance Standards. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a landmark
or a property located within the Historic Overlay District shall permit the property to fall into serious state of
disrepair so as to result in the significant deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the
judgment of the Richmond Historical Commission, create a detrimental effect upon the historic character of the
landmark or Historic Overlay District. Examples of serious disrepair or significant deterioration include:
1. Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations, or other vertical support that causes leaning, splitting, listing, or
buckling.
2. Deterioration of external chimneys that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling.
3. Deterioration or crumbling of exterior plaster finishes, surfaces, or mortars.
4. Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, and foundations, including broken windows or doors.
5. Defective protection or lack of weather protection for exterior wall and roof coverings, including lack of paint, or
weathering due to lack of paint or other protective covering.
6. Rotting, holes, and other forms of material decay.
7. Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails, window and door frames, cornices, entablatures, wall facings,
and architectural details that causes delaminating instability, loss of shape and form, or crumbling.
8. Deterioration that has determined effect upon the special character of the district as a whole or the unique
attributes and character of the contributing structure.
9. Deterioration of any exterior feature so as to create or permit the creation of any hazardous or unsafe conditions
to life, health, or other property.
D. Demolition of Landmarks. It is the intent to preserve the historic and architectural resources of the City through
limitations on demolition and removal of landmarks to the extent it is economically feasible, practical, and
necessary.
1. Demolition or Removal Discouraged. The demolition or removal of historic buildings, structures, and sites in the
City diminishes the character of the City's Historic Overlay District and it is strongly discouraged. Instead the City
recommends and supports preservation, rehabilitation, and relocation within the Historic Overlay District.
2. Necessary Demolition or Removal. It is recognized that structural deterioration, economic hardship, and other
factors not entirely within the control of the property owner may result in necessary demolition or removal of a
historic building, structure, or site.
3. Demolition or Removal Notice. The Code Official shall be required to provide written notice to the Richmond
Historical Commission via the Historic Preservation Officer of the demolition or removal of historic buildings,
structures, and sites in accordance with Subsection G., below.
E. Removal or Repair of Hazardous or Dangerous Landmarks.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 227
1. Authority. The provision contained in §214.00111 of the Tex. Local Gov't Code provides additional authority to
the City to preserve substandard historic buildings and are effective immediately upon designation as Certified
Local Government by the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, and Texas State Historic
Preservation Officer as provided by 16 U.S.C., Section 470 et seq.;
2. Notice. If the Building Official determines a landmark to be structurally unsound and a hazardous or dangerous
building pursuant to the provisions found in the City's adopted building code, the Code Official shall be required
to provide written notice to the RHC of the ordered removal or repair of the landmark prior to taking such
action; and
3. Penalties. The property owner(s) of the demolished landmark removed under this UDC is subject to the penalties
outlined in Section 6.4.203, Civil Penalties.
F. Ordinary Maintenance. Nothing in this Subsection shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance and
repair of any exterior architectural feature of a landmark or property within a historic district which does not involve
a change in design, material, or outward appearance that require the issuance of a building permit. In-kind repair,
replacement, and repainting is included in this definition of ordinary maintenance unless painting involves an
exterior masonry surface that was not previously painted. The Historic Preservation Officer shall be in charge of
making the decision as to what is ordinary maintenance.
G. Incentives. The City has determined that the Historical Overlay District is in need of tax relief to encourage
reinvestment, preservation, and renovation of this area. In order to accomplish this goal, tax abatement on part of
the assessed value of such structures once they have been restored or renovated, as well as other forms of
incentives, are necessary. In accordance with state law, the City Commission finds that any building, site, or structure
which meets the definition of Landmark is in need of tax relief to encourage preservation. Such properties which are
substantially rehabilitated and/or restored as certified by the RHC and approved by the Fort Bend County Central
Appraisal District, may have reduced assessed value for ad valorem taxes.

Division 6.1.100 General Regulations
Sec. 6.1.101 Nonconformities, Generally
A. Generally. A nonconformity is when a nonconformity must be terminated or removed, and when it is allowed to be
restored after temporary cessation, damage, or destruction.
B. Unlawful Uses, Buildings, Structures, or Signs. This Article does not authorize or legitimize uses, buildings,
structures, or signs that were not legally established or constructed. Such uses, buildings, structures, or signs are not
"legally nonconforming," but instead remain "unlawful," and are subject to all of the provisions of this UDC
(including enforcement provisions) and any other applicable law. Likewise, this Article does not legitimize unlawful
subdivisions of property that may have occurred before the effective date of this UDC.
C. Effect on Existing Development Entitlements. Nothing in this UDC shall be interpreted to require a change in plans,
construction, or designated use of any building or structure in which a building permit was lawfully issued prior to
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this UDC, provided construction was commenced within 60 days
after obtaining said building permit and diligently completed.
D. Nonconformities Created by Public Action. Any nonconforming building or structure or land expressly created or
caused by a conveyance of privately owned land to a federal, state, or local government to serve a public purpose is
conforming for the purposes of this UDC, and is not subject to the limitations of this Article. This exemption applies
only in cases where private land is obtained by a governmental entity for a public purpose, through condemnation,
threat of condemnation or otherwise, which creates a nonconformity in the remainder parcel in terms of setback, lot
size, or other applicable standards of this UDC. This exemption does not apply to right-of-way dedication or other
public conveyances of land required by the City in the course of subdivision or other routine site plan approvals.
Sec. 6.1.102 Nonconforming Uses
A. Generally. A nonconforming use is a use of land that was lawfully established (e.g., it was allowed and issued a
permit, if a permit was required at the time the use was established) on a parcel or lot before the effective date of
this UDC, that is no longer allowed after the effective date of this UDC. Amendments to this UDC may also make uses
nonconforming. The following uses are legally nonconforming uses:
1. Uses that were lawfully established but are not currently listed as permitted, limited, conditional, or temporary
uses in the zoning district in Division 2.2.100, Permitted, Limited, Conditional, and Temporary Uses.
2. Uses that are listed as "Limited Uses" in the zoning districts in Division 2.2.100, Permitted, Limited, Conditional,
and Temporary Uses, but were lawfully established without a valid permit (issued in conformance with the
additional limited use standards) and do not comply with the applicable standards of Division 2.2.200, Limited
and Conditional Use Standards.
3. Uses that are listed as "Conditional Uses" in the zoning districts in Division 2.2.100, Permitted, Limited,
Conditional, and Temporary Uses, but were lawfully established without a conditional use permit. For these uses,
the nonconforming use status may be removed by obtaining a conditional use permit.

4. Uses that were lawfully established within a floodplain or floodway, but are no longer permitted in the floodplain
or floodway.
B. Classifications of Nonconforming Uses. There are two types of nonconforming uses: major nonconforming uses and
minor nonconforming uses. The classification of the nonconforming use affects whether or not it can be converted
to a conforming use.
1. Major Nonconforming Uses. Major nonconforming uses are those uses for which the nonconformity generates a
nuisance per se or represents such incompatibility with abutting uses and/or the Comprehensive Master Plan
that public policy favors their elimination from the zoning district if they are discontinued, abandoned, or
destroyed. Examples of major nonconforming uses include (but are not limited to):
a. Bars or nightclubs;
b. Manufactured homes; and
c. Recycling collection facilities.
2. Minor Nonconforming Uses. All nonconforming uses that are not classified as major nonconforming uses are
minor nonconforming uses. Such uses may be converted to conforming uses as provided in Section 6.1.108,
Conversion of Nonconformities.
C. Standards.
1. All Nonconforming Uses.
a. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
b. If a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed.
c. If the use of only a portion of a building or property is changed from a nonconforming use to a conforming
use, then the use of that portion of the building or property shall not be changed back to the nonconforming
use.
2. Major Nonconforming Uses.
a. If a major nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six months, for any reason, it shall not be
resumed.
b. Major nonconforming uses shall not be expanded, enlarged, extended, increased, or moved to occupy an
area of land or building that was not used or occupied on the effective date of this UDC or any amendment
that made the use a major nonconforming use.
3. Minor Nonconforming Uses.
a. If a minor nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six months, for any reason, it shall not be
resumed. However, if an application for conversion of the use is filed pursuant to Section 6.1.108 ,
Conversion of Nonconformities, before the end of the six month period, the use may be resumed as a
conforming use after the period expires if the application is granted.
b. No minor nonconforming use shall be expanded or extended in such a way as to:
1. Occupy any open space or landscaped area that is required by this UDC;
2. Exceed pervious cover, intensity, or height limitations of the zoning district in which the use is located;
3. Occupy any land beyond the boundaries of the property or lot as it existed on the effective date of this
UDC; or
4. Displace any conforming use in the same building or on the same parcel.
Sec. 6.1.103 Nonconforming Buildings and Structures
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 243
A. Generally. A building or structure is classified as nonconforming if it was lawfully constructed prior to the effective
date of this UDC (or amendment hereto) and does not conform to the height, yard, pervious cover, density,
intensity, building scale, or design standards that are applicable to the same type of building or structure in the
zoning district in which the building or structure is located.
B. Standards.
1. If a nonconforming building or structure or nonconforming element of a nonconforming building or structure is
damaged or destroyed by any means, or is declared unsafe by the Code Official to an extent that repairs would
exceed more than 50 percent of the replacement cost of the building or structure or damaged nonconforming
element, the building or structure shall be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this UDC.
2. If the reconstruction cost and/or area of reconstruction (whichever is less) is less than or equal to 50 percent of
the cost of replacement or area of the building or structure, respectively, then the building or structure may be
strengthened or restored to a safe condition provided that:
a. The original nonconformity is not enlarged, increased, or extended;
b. Building permits are obtained for repairs within 12 months of the date the building was damaged or, if no
date can be reasonably established for the damage, the date that the Code Official determines that the
building is unsafe; and
c. The construction is commenced within 12 months after obtaining the required building permits.
3. Routine maintenance of nonconforming buildings and structures is permitted, including necessary non-structural
repairs, paint, and incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the nonconforming buildings or
structures or materially extend their life. This standard also applies to buildings or structures that are used by
nonconforming uses if they are designed in a way that is not suitable for re-use as a conforming use (if the
building is conforming and could be re-used for a conforming use, there is no limitation on its maintenance).
4. Structural alterations to nonconforming buildings or structures are permitted only if it is demonstrated that the
alteration will eliminate the nonconformity or reduce it in accordance with the standards of this Section.
5. No building or structure that contains a major nonconforming use shall be enlarged unless the major
nonconforming use is permanently discontinued.
C. Standards for Existing Buildings or Structures in the Regulated Floodway. It is the intent of the City that no
permanent buildings or structures be located or substantially improved in the Regulated Floodway, except according
to the standards in Division 4.3.200, Floodplain Management and Flood Damage Prevention, and that existing legal
nonconforming buildings or structures shall be removed upon abandonment, destruction, or substantial damage.
Sec. 6.1.104 Nonconforming Lots
A. Generally. Nonconforming lots are lots that were lawfully created before the effective date of this UDC or
amendments hereto, but which no longer comply with the lot width, lot area, or access requirements of this UDC.
B. Standards.
1. Combination of Lots to Increase Conformity.
a. Where a landowner owns more than one abutting lot that does not conform to the dimensional
requirements of the zoning district in which they are located, they shall be combined to create fully
conforming lots or, if full conformity is not possible, they shall be combined if the combination will increase
the degree of conformity (see Figure 6.1.104, Combination of Nonconforming Lots).
b. The City will not require the combination of lots pursuant to Subsection B.1.a, above, if (see Figure 6.1.104,
Combination of Nonconforming Lots):
1. The combination of lots would not address the nonconformity;
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 244
2. The combination of lots would materially disrupt the lotting pattern of the street, for example, by
creating a through lot mid-block on a street segment that does not include any other through lots;
3. Two or more of the lots are developed with principal buildings, and the combination of lots would require
that one or more of the buildings be torn down in order to comply with this UDC; or
4. The combination of lots would result in regularly shaped lots being combined into a single lot with an
irregular shape.
Figure 6.1.104
Combination of Nonconforming Lots
2. Construction on Legal Lots That Does Not Conform to Dimensional Requirements. A legal lot that does not meet
zoning district requirements with respect to lot area or lot width may be built upon if, as of the effective date of
this UDC:
a. The lot is a lot of record; and
b. The use is permitted in the zoning district in which the lot is located; and
c. The lot has sufficient frontage on a public street to provide access that is appropriate for the proposed use;
and
d. All yards or height standards are complied with, except that the Code Official may authorize a reduction of
required yards of up to 10 percent, provided that the Code Official finds that the reduction does not allow a
building that would be larger than a building that would be permitted on the minimum conforming lot in the
zoning district.
Sec. 6.1.105 Nonconforming Signs
A. Generally. Any permanent sign located within the City limits and the extraterritorial jurisdiction on the effective date
of this UDC that does not conform to the provisions of Article 4.7, Signs, is a "legal nonconforming" sign, provided it
also meets the following requirements:
1. The sign was approved by a sign permit as of the effective date of this UDC, or amendment hereto, if a permit
was required under applicable law; or
2. If no sign permit was required under applicable law for the sign in question, the sign:
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 245
a. Was in all respects in conformity with the applicable law (or there was no applicable law) immediately prior
to the effective date; or
b. Had legal nonconforming status at such time.
B. General Standards.
1. A nonconforming sign which has been damaged by fire, wind, or other cause in excess of 60 percent of its
replacement cost shall not be restored except in conformance with this UDC.
2. If a nonconforming sign structure does not display any message for a period of three months, it shall be removed
or brought into conformance with this UDC.
3. If a nonconforming sign structure is removed for any reason other than routine repair and maintenance, it shall
not be replaced unless the replacement sign conforms to this UDC.
4. Nonconforming signs that are a danger to public safety due to damage or wear shall be removed and shall not be
replaced unless the replacement sign conforms to this UDC.
5. Routine maintenance of nonconforming signs is permitted, including non-structural repairs and paint (even if
such repairs would materially extend the life of the sign), changes to the sign face or messages, and incidental
alterations that do not increase the nonconformity or sign area. Structural repairs or changes are not allowed. If
the sign requires structural repairs because it has been damaged, destroyed, or worn, it shall be removed as
required by Article 4.7, Signs.
6. Structural alterations to nonconforming signs are permitted only if it is demonstrated that the alternative will
eliminate the nonconformity or reduce it in accordance with this Section.
7. Temporary signs that are not in compliance with this UDC shall be removed as required by Article 4.7, Signs.
C. Nonconforming Off-Premise Signs. No existing off-premise sign that is required to be removed by the City because
the sign, or a substantial part of the sign, is blown down or otherwise destroyed or dismantled for any purpose other
than lawful maintenance operations, or for the changing of the letters, symbols, or other matter on the sign, shall be
enlarged, repaired, or reconstructed except in compliance with this Code.
1. Construction and Operating Permits Required. A new construction permit and a new operating permit (as
applicable) shall be required for any sign that is enlarged, repaired or reconstructed.
2. Routine Maintenance. The following are considered to be routine maintenance activities that do not require a
construction permit:
a. The replacement of minor parts if the materials of the minor parts are the same type as those being replaced
and the basic design or structure of the sign is not altered;
b. The replacement of nuts and bolts, nailing, riveting, or minor welding; cleaning and painting;
c. Manipulation of the sign structure to level or plumb it; and
d. Changing the advertising message.
3. Substantial Changes. The following are examples of substantial changes that require a construction permit
application before the initiation of such activity:
a. Changing or replacing all or part of the sign face structure;
b. Replacement of poles or changing the number of poles in the sign structure;
c. Adding a catwalk to the sign structure;
d. Adding lights to a non-illuminated sign or adding more intense lighting to an illuminated sign whether or not
the lights are attached to the sign structure;
e. Adding permanent bracing wires, guy wires, or other reinforcing devices;
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 246
f. Changing the material used in the construction of the sign structure, such as replacing wooden material with
metal material;
g. Adding faces to a sign or changing the sign configuration;
h. Changing the height of the sign;
i. Changing the configuration of the sign structure, such as changing a "V-shaped" sign to a stacked or back-toback
sign, or a single face sign to a back-to-back sign; and
j. Moving the sign structure or sign face in any way.
Sec. 6.1.106 Nonconforming Parking and Landscaping
A. Generally. Nonconforming parking refers to parking spaces, parking drive aisles, and loading areas, and the required
landscaping that normally is associated with it, that do not conform to the requirements that are set out in Article
4.2, Parking, Loading, Access, and Lighting, or Article 4.4, Tree Preservation, Buffering, and Landscaping, in terms of
their number or dimensions.
B. Standards.
1. If an existing building or use is expanded, additional parking and landscaping shall be required only in proportion
to the new area of the building or use.
2. If the use of a building changes, resulting in additional demand for parking, additional parking and associated
landscaping shall be provided in an amount equal to the difference between the requirements of the former use
(not the actual parking provided on-site) and the requirements for the new use, as set out in Division 4.2.100,
Parking and Loading, and Article 4.4, Tree Preservation, Buffering, and Landscaping. However, a permit for the
new use may be denied if the available parking is less than 75 percent of the required parking.
3. If an existing building is redeveloped or substantially improved, parking shall be provided as required by Article
4.2, Parking, Loading, Access, and Lighting, and Article 4.4, Tree Preservation, Buffering, and Landscaping.
4. If a nonconforming use is required to be brought fully into compliance, then parking and landscaping shall also
be brought into compliance.
Sec. 6.1.107 Nonconforming MHPs and RV Parks
A. Manufactured Homes, Generally. Manufactured homes that are 10 years or older and located outside of an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision, may be replaced subject to the provisions of Section 6.3.408, Manufactured
Home Hardship Permit.

2. Is not authorized by law on September 1, 2017, but no action has been taken to enforce the violation of
the applicable municipal regulations before September 1, 2017; and
b. At least 50 percent of the manufactured home lots in the manufactured home community are occupied by a
manufactured home used as a residence.
2. For the purposes of Sec. 6.1.107.B.1, requiring a change in the nonconforming use includes:
a. Requiring the amount of land designated as a nonconforming use to be decreased;
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 247
b. Imposing an expiration on the nonconforming use designation;
c. Declaring that the nonconforming use of the land has been abandoned; and
d. Requiring an amortization period for the nonconforming use of the land.
3. For the purposes of Sec. 6.1.107.B.2, any period during which a manufactured home used as a residence is
removed from a manufactured home lot for repair of the home or replacement of the home by another
manufactured home used as a residence is included in the prior during which the manufactured home lot is
considered occupied by the manufactured home.
4. Replacement. A manufactured home owner may install a new or used manufactured home, regardless of the
size, or any appurtenance on a manufactured home lot located on land in a manufactured home community and
for which a nonconforming use is authorized by law or has been otherwise allowed under Sec. 6.1.107.B.1.a.2.,
provided that the manufactured home or appurtenance and the installation of the manufactured home or
appurtenance comply with:
a. Nonconforming land use standards, including standards relating to separation and setback distances and lot
size, applicable on:
1. For an authorized nonconforming use, the date the nonconforming use of the land constituting the
manufactured home community was authorized by law; or
2. For a nonconforming use under Sec. 6.1.107.B.1.a.2; and
b. All applicable state and federal law and standards in effect on the date of the installation of the
manufactured home or appurtenance.
5. If the conditions stated in Sec. 6.1.107.B.1 do not exist for a Manufactured Home Park, then in such event the
following shall apply:
a. Replacement.
1. Each manufactured home shall only be replaced one time with a newer model constructed no greater
than 10 years from the date of the proposed replacement.
2. The replacement manufactured home shall be of equal size or greater than the manufactured home it is
replacing and shall be installed in conformance with Section 4.1.204, Manufactured Home Parks and
Subdivisions.

licensed operation prior to the effective date of this UDC that does not fully comply with the provisions set out in
Section 4.1.205, Recreational Vehicle Parks, shall be considered a nonconforming, grandfathered RV park until there
is a change in ownership.
D. Recreational Vehicle (RV) Park Standards. Nonconforming recreational vehicle parks shall be made conforming
upon a change or transfer in ownership of the property. The new property owner shall be issued a temporary license
and given 90 days to bring the existing RV park into compliance with the requirements of Section 4.1.205,
Recreational Vehicle Parks. The Code Official is authorized to grant extensions for work that may require more than
90 days, up to and not exceeding one year. The extension shall be in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated.

City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 248
[Ord. # 2018-18, 10/15/2018]
Effective on: 10/15/2018
Sec. 6.1.108 Conversion of Nonconformities
A. Purpose. In many instances, minor nonconforming uses are integral parts of the City's fabric, that is, its character
and function, so their continuing existence promotes the City's policy objective of protecting its neighborhoods. In
these instances, the classification "nonconformity" and resulting restriction on investment may not be what the
community desires. As such, the use may be made conforming pursuant to this Section in order to remove the
potential stigma that may be associated with the "nonconforming" designation.
B. Procedure. An owner of a minor nonconforming use may apply for a conditional use permit which has the effect of
making the nonconforming use conforming. The criteria for conditional use approval are set out in Subsection D.,
below.
C. Exclusions. This procedure does not apply to nonconforming lots, which may be buildable in accordance with the
standards of Section 6.1.104, Nonconforming Lots.
D. Criteria for Approval. A conditional use permit approval may be granted to make a nonconforming building,
structure, or use conforming, if, in addition to the criteria for approval of a conditional use permit set out in Section
6.3.313, Conditional Use Permits, and Division 2.2.200, Limited and Conditional Use Standards, all of the criteria of
this Section are satisfied.
1. Approval Criteria. The use, as conducted and managed, has minimal nonconformities and has been integrated
into the neighborhood's (or zoning district's if it is not in or adjacent to a residential neighborhood) function, as
evidenced by the following demonstrations:
a. The neighborhood residents regularly patronize or are employed at said use (for nonresidential uses in or
abutting residential neighborhoods).
b. Management practices eliminate nuisances such as noise, light, waste materials, unreasonably congested onstreet
parking, or similar conflicts.
c. There is no material history of complaints about the use (a history of complaints is justification for denying
the conditional use permit, unless the conditions of the permit will eliminate the sources of the complaints).
d. The use has been maintained in good condition and its classification as a nonconformity would be a
disincentive for such maintenance.
2. Conditions. Conditions may be imposed relative to the expansion of bufferyards, landscaping and landscape
areas, or other site design provisions, or other limitations necessary to ensure that, as a conforming use, the use
will not become a nuisance. Such conditions may relate to the lot, buildings, structures, or operation of the use.
E. Effect and Annotation. Uses that comply with the terms of a conditional use permit issued in accordance with this
Section are converted from "legally nonconforming uses" to "conforming uses" by virtue of the issuance of the
permit.
1. Written Approval. Conditional use permit approvals shall be provided to the applicant in writing and may be
recorded by the applicant at the applicant's expense.
2. Annotation of Official Zoning Map. Upon granting a conditional use permit and the applicant's demonstration of
compliance with any conditions placed upon it, the Code Official shall place an annotation on the official zoning
map that states that the property has a conditional use permit, as well as the permit number and date of
approval.

The following general procedures shall be reflected in the adopted rules of procedure.

3. Zoning Board of Adjustment Decisions. In accordance with Section 211.009, Authority of Board, of the Tex. Local
Gov't Code, the decisions of the Zoning Board of Adjustment are as follows.
a. In exercising its powers, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions of the
statutes of the state as existing or hereafter amended, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made and shall have all the powers of the
officer from whom the appeal is taken.
b. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the power to impose reasonable conditions to be complied with
by the applicant. The concurring vote of 75 percent of the number of regular members of the Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any such
administrative official, or to decide in favor of the application on any matter upon which it is required to pass
under this Chapter or to effect any variance in said Chapter.
4. Protest against change. In case of a protest against a change in zoning district, signed by the owners of 20
percent or more either of the land included in such proposed change, or of the land within 200 feet thereof,
including any intervening public street, such amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote
of three-fourths of all the members of the City Commission.
F. Time Limitations for Decisions.
1. For rezoning applications, the Planning and Zoning Commission may defer its report for not more than 60 days to
the City Commission. If the Planning and Zoning Commission fails to finally report after 60 days to the City
Commission, then the report is deemed to have a recommendation of denial. If the Planning and Zoning
Commission makes a recommendation after the public hearing, then the proposal will move forward to the next
regularly scheduled City Commission hearing in accordance with Section 6.3.206, Public Notice.
2. For preliminary and final plats, the City Commission shall have final consideration of approval, which must occur
within 30 days from when the application has been determined complete.
G. Conditions of Approval. Some procedures set out in this UDC authorize the administering body to impose such
conditions upon the premises benefited by the approval as may be necessary to reduce, minimize or eliminate
potential adverse impact upon other property in the area, or to carry out the general purpose and intent of the
Comprehensive Master Plan and this UDC. In such cases, any conditions attached to approvals shall be directly
related to the impacts of the proposed use or development, and shall be roughly proportional in both extent and
amount to the anticipated impacts of the proposed use or development, and / or shall carry out the general purpose
and intent of the City's Comprehensive Master Plan and this UDC. No conditions of approval, except for those
attached to a variance approval, shall be less restrictive than the requirements of this UDC.
Sec. 6.3.208 Continuances and Withdrawal of Applications
A. Continuances. Requests for continuance of any proceeding called for in this UDC may be granted at the discretion of
the administering body holding the meeting. If granted, the applicant shall pay all additional costs associated with
the rescheduling of the proceeding.
B. Withdrawal. Any application may be withdrawn, either in writing or on the record during the proceeding before the
recommendation or decision is made.
Sec. 6.3.209 Successive Application
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 271
A. Generally. It is the policy of the City not to hear successive applications for the same approval after an application is
denied. The limitations of this Section prevent the consideration of successive applications.
B. Time Required Between Substantially Similar Applications. The City shall not accept any application that is
substantially similar to an application that was denied six months prior.
C. Appeal and Waiver of Restrictions.
1. The Code Official's determination that an application is substantially similar to a denied application is subject to
administrative appeal (see Section 6.3.601, Appeals of Administrative Decisions).
2. In the alternative to an appeal, the applicant may seek a waiver of the successive application rules from the City
Commission, which may grant the waiver for good cause shown.
Sec. 6.3.210 Inspection of Public Improvements
A. Generally. The City shall have the authority to inspect work and materials furnished as part of the work associated
with the construction of public improvements. Inspections made by the City are for the sole benefit of the City and
do not relieve the contractor, owner, or developer of any obligations or liabilities.
B. Effect on Certificate of Occupancy. Except as otherwise agreed by the City, no certificate of occupancy for any
habitable structure shall be issued until all required public improvements have been completed and finally accepted
for maintenance and/or ownership by the City or other applicable public agency or private party.
Sec. 6.3.211 Stale Applications
A. Generally. Applications for development approval must be diligently pursued by the applicant. Accordingly, this
Section extinguishes applications that become stale due to inaction by the applicant.
B. Expiration of Stale Applications.
1. When an action by the applicant is required for further processing of an application (e.g., submittal of
supplementary documentation), the application shall become void six months after the date that the action is
requested if:
a. The applicant fails to take action; or
b. The applicant fails to request an extension of time pursuant to Subsection C., below.
2. When an action by the applicant is required for further processing of an application for preliminary plat approval,
the application shall become void 29 days from receipt of the application if the application has remained
dormant during that period where no activity has occurred toward the completion of the application, where
changes or corrections are required, or where instruments or documents requested or required is not
forthcoming within that period from the property owner or authorized agent.
3. No refunds of application fees will be issued to applicants whose applications expire pursuant to this Section.

City as necessary to make an informed analysis and decision.
C. Procedure. A rezoning is processed according to the sequential steps set out in Section 6.3.202, Pre-Application
Conference, through Section 6.3.207, Public Meetings and Hearings, and shall be decided by the City Commission
after recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, as set out in Section 6.3.103, Public Hearing and
Meeting Approvals, including the following:
1. Staff Review. The Code Official shall review each proposed rezoning in light of the decision criteria of Subsection

recommendation after the public hearing, then the proposal will move forward to the next regularly
scheduled City Commission hearing as per the notice requirements set out in Section 6.3.206, Public Notice.
c. Upon receiving the final report of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City Secretary or City Attorney
shall draft and forward an ordinance to the City Commission for consideration.
D. Decision Criteria. The City Commission may approve or conditionally approve an application for a rezoning after the
final report and recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission if:
1. The proposed zoning is preferable to the existing zoning in terms of its likelihood of advancing the goals,
objectives, and policies of the Comprehensive Master Plan or another adopted land use or area plan, including,
but not limited to, any small area or redevelopment plans;
2. The proposed zoning is consistent with the future land use plan of the Comprehensive Master Plan (a future land
use plan amendment may be processed concurrently with the rezoning);
3. The proposed zoning change is consistent with the implementation of existing or pending plans for providing
streets, water and wastewater, other public utilities, and the delivery of public services to the area in which the
parcel proposed for a rezoning is located;
4. The range of uses and the character of development that is allowed by the proposed zoning district will be
compatible with the properties in the immediate vicinity of the parcel proposed for a rezoning, and the parcel
proposed for a rezoning has sufficient dimensions to accommodate reasonable development that complies with
the requirements of this UDC, including parking and buffering requirements; and
5. The pace of development and/or the amount of vacant land currently zoned for comparable development in the
vicinity suggests a need for the proposed rezoning in order to ensure an appropriate inventory of land to
maintain a competitive land market that promotes economic development.
E. Additional Conditions. A request for a rezoning may be conditioned upon adherence to a site plan submitted by the
applicant, which may limit the uses that are permitted on the site. The site plan may be processed concurrently with
the rezoning request if it meets all the applicable requirements of this UDC, as set out in Section 6.3.302, Site
Development Plan.

those set out in Division 4.3.200, Floodplain Management and Flood Damage Prevention.
B. Appeals. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there
is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement

acre or less in size that is contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the
base flood elevation, providing the relevant factors set out in Section 6.3.307, Floodplain Development Permit,
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
3. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure
and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
D. Prerequisites for Granting Floodplain Variances.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 296
1. Floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

the purpose and objectives of this UDC, and specifically those set out in Division 4.3.200, Floodplain Management
and Flood Damage Prevention.
G. Notification. Any application to which a floodplain variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure
will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

Sec. 6.3.409 Variances
A. Generally. The variance process is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this UDC in those
cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create an unnecessary hardship by preventing the use

B. Applicability.
1. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize such variances as will not be contrary to the spirit of this UDC;
are consistent with the interests of public health, safety, and welfare; and where there is substantial justice for
the applicant and owners, as well as the residents of surrounding properties. Variances may be authorized only
in accordance with the conditions enumerated in Subsection F., Decision Criteria, below, and then only in
compliance with the procedures of this Subsection.
2. An application for a variance may be filed by the owner of, or any other person having a contractual interest in,
the subject property.

conditions of approval imposed by an administering body described in Article 6.2, Administrative Bodies.
Modifications to conditions of approval shall be sought from the body that granted the approval.
c. Variances Regarding Nonconformities. These variances include those that would have the effect of making an
existing nonconforming or illegal construction (buildings and structures), site improvements, parking, or
landscaping conforming. Nonconforming situations are subject to the requirements of Article 6.1,
Nonconformities.
d. Floodplain Variances. This includes variances to the requirements of Division 4.3.200, Floodplain
Management and Flood Damage Prevention, which are handled by the Code Official, in consultation with the
City Engineer.

which would constitute a change in district boundaries (e.g., variances to Article 2.2, Land Use).
f. Conditional Use Variances. Variances shall not be used to modify any requirements that are set out in
Division 2.2.200, Limited and Conditional Use Standards, with respect to an application for conditional use
approval.

the City unless such authority is expressly granted to the City.
C. Application.
1. Applications for a variance shall be on a form approved by the Code Official.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 299
2. It is the obligation of an applicant, who bears the burden of proof, to present facts about the circumstances
which would justify a variance in convincing fashion so that the Zoning Board of Adjustment may be satisfied that
the request meets each of the criteria set out in Subsection F., below.
D. Procedure. Variances are processed according to the sequential steps set out in Section 6.3.202, Pre-Application
Conference, through Section 6.3.207, Public Meetings and Hearings, and shall be referred to other departments, as
applicable, and then decided by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, as set out in Section 6.3.103, Public Hearing and
Meeting Approvals.
E. Additional Conditions. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the
premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this Section, to
reduce or minimize the effect of such variations upon other property in the neighborhood and to better carry out
the general intent of this UDC.
F. Decision Criteria. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from the strict application of this UDC if the
variance is not prohibited by Subsection B., above, and the Zoning Board of Adjustment makes findings based upon
the evidence presented to it in each specific case that all of the following are demonstrated:
1. The variance is consistent with the policy directions of the Comprehensive Master Plan.
2. The variance will not permit an intensity of use of land that is not permitted in the applicable district;
3. The variance will not permit a use of land, building, or structure that is not otherwise permitted in the applicable
district;
4. The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible a permitted use of the land, building, or
structure;
5. Granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this UDC, and will not be
injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
6. A literal interpretation of the provisions of this UDC would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by
other residents of the district in which the property is located;
7. Granting the variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied to other lands or
structures in the same district;
8. The need for a variance does not result from the actions of the applicant; and
9. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the subject property because of its size, shape,
or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district.
G. Effect of Decision.
1. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a variance.
2. An application for a variance may be processed simultaneously with other required applications, and approval of
the other applications may be a condition of approval of the variance. However, each application shall be
processed on its own independent merits according to the standards applicable to the application.
3. All applicants requesting a variance from the provisions of this UDC shall be notified in writing of the final action
taken by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
4. An approved variance shall be accompanied by an order of the Zoning Board of Adjustment to direct the issuance
of a permit within 10 business days.

6.3.411 Demolition by Neglect
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 301
A. Generally. Demolition by neglect refers to the gradual deterioration of a property when routine or minimum
maintenance is not performed. The Historic Preservation Officer and Building Department staff shall work together
in an effort to reduce demolition by neglect involving landmarks or properties located within the Historic Overlay
(HD) District. A demolition by neglect citation as determined by the Richmond Historical Commission may be issued
against the owner of the property for failure to comply with the minimum maintenance standards by permitting the
subject property to exhibit serious disrepair or significant deterioration as outlined in Section 5.1.301, Historic
Overlay District Design Standards.
B. Procedure. The procedure for citing a property for demolition by neglect shall be as follows:
1. Identification. Initial identification is made by visual inspection of the area by the Historic Preservation Officer or
a Richmond Historical Commission member. The Historic Preservation Officer is the point of contact, however,
the Building Department staff shall when needed assist with inspections. If there is dispute between the Historic
Preservation Officer and Building Department staff, the City Manager may be consulted as a mitigating party. All
referrals shall be made in writing and submitted to the Historic Preservation Officer.
2. Preliminary Determination. Once the initial identification is made, followed by the preliminary determination by
the Historic Preservation Officer, the property owner shall be notified by U.S. Mail of the defects of the building
and informed of various incentive programs that may be available for repair.
3. Stabilization Proposal. Within thirty (30) days, the owner shall respond to the preliminary determination by
submitting a stabilization proposal to the Historic Preservation Officer. The stabilization proposal will be
presented to the Richmond Historic Commission at the next available regularly scheduled meeting.
C. Approval. If the Richmond Historic Commission approves the proposal, a certificate of appropriateness may be
issued administratively by the Historic Preservation Officer. The approval will detail the specific work which is
necessary to correct the demolition by neglect conditions, as well as a time period to begin and complete the work.
The Historic Preservation Officer shall update the Richmond Historic Commission on the status of the property every
30 days once work begins on the property.
D. Failure to Respond.
1. First Attempt. The Historic Preservation Officer will send notice by U. S. Mail, certified, return receipt requested,
of the defects of the building and provide information of various incentive programs that may be available for
repair of the building. If the property owner receives the letter regarding the preliminary determination but fails
to respond within thirty (30) days, a second notice shall be sent as described in Subsection D.2., below.
2. Second Attempt. The Historic Preservation Officer will send notice by U. S. Mail, certified, return receipt
requested, providing the information described in Subsection D.1., above. If the property owner fails to receive
the letter or receives the letter and fails to respond to the within 15 days, the matter returns to the RHC for a
citation hearing. The HPO shall send notice of the citation hearing by U. S. Mail, certified, return receipt
requested informing the owner of the hearing, that the property is posted with a notice of the violation, and that
a public hearing on the citation is scheduled.
E. Public Hearing. The owner is invited to address the Richmond Historic Commissions concerns and to show cause
why a citation should not be issued. The Richmond Historic Commission may take action to approve any proposed
work, defer the matter to give the owner more time either to correct the deficiencies, make a proposal for
stabilization, or issue a citation to the owner of the property for failure to correct the demolition by neglect
conditions.
F. Citation Issued. If the owner is cited for the condition of demolition by neglect of the property, the owner shall,
within 14 days, submit a stabilization proposal to the Historic Preservation Officer. At the discretion of the Richmond
Historic Commission, the owner may be given up to one year to correct the defects. The Historic Preservation Officer
shall update the Richmond Historic Commission on the status of the property every 30 days once work begins on the
property.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 302

Division 6.3.500 Subdivision and Plat Approvals
Sec. 6.3.501 Land Plan or Concept Plan
A. Generally. Where the parcel proposed for development or subdivision constitutes a unit of a larger tract owned or
controlled by the subdivider which is intended to be subsequently subdivided as additional phases of development, a
concept plan shall be required showing the conceptual layout of the entire area of the tract, including the tentative
proposal layout of streets, blocks, drainage, water, sewerage and other improvements for such areas.
B. Application. Application for a concept plan shall be made on a form approved by the Code Official.
C. Procedure. Concept plans are processed according to the sequential steps set out in Section 6.3.202, Pre-Application

concurrent review. However, such plan must be approved before any preliminary plat of such development is
approved.
3. When a concept plan is required, every preliminary plat must substantially comply with the approved concept
plan.
D. Decision Criteria. The administering body may initially approve a new concept plan, or modify a previously approved
concept plan, only when it finds that:

CHAPTER 7 MEASUREMENTS AND WORDS
ARTICLE 7.1 MEASUREMENTS, WORD USAGE, AND DEFINITIONS
Division 7.1.100 Measurements
Sec. 7.1.101 Density
A. Generally. Density is measured in two ways: gross density and net density (see Figure 7.1.101 , Illustrative Density
Calculation).
B. Gross Density. Gross density is calculated by dividing the number of proposed dwelling units by the base site area.
C. Net Density. Net density is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units by the net buildable area of the
parcel proposed for development.
Figure 7.1.101

Table Notes:
1Calculations for Base Site Area are included for illustrative purposes.
Sec. 7.1.102 Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
A. Generally. The unit of measurement for intensity is called floor area ratio (FAR).
B. Calculation.
1. For individual lots, FAR is calculated by dividing the total floor area on the lot by the lot area.
2. For parcels proposed for development, gross FAR is calculated by dividing the total floor area on the parcel
proposed for development by the base site area (see Figure 7.1.102, Illustrative Floor Area Ratio Calculation).
C. Structured Parking Exception. The floor area of a parking structure is not included in the calculation of FAR.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 320
Figure 7.1.102
Illustrative Floor Area Ratio Calculation
EXAMPLE
The example below is 80,000 square feet of floor area, located on a parcel with a 12 acre base site area. Its FAR is:

522,720 square feet of Base Site Area
(12 acres TIMES 43,560 square feet per acre)
EQUALS
0.153 FAR
Sec. 7.1.103 Gross Floor Area
The measurement of gross floor area (GFA) shall be computed by applying the following criteria:
A. Horizontal square footage is measured from the outside face of all exterior walls;
B. Cellars; basements; penthouses; attics; covered or uncovered porches, terraces, or breezeways; balconies and decks;
enclosed storage or mechanical areas; mezzanines; and similar structures shall be included as GFA wherever at least
seven feet are provided between the finished floor and the ceiling;
C. No deduction shall apply for horizontal areas void of actual floor space (e.g., elevator shafts and stairwells); and
D. Protected upper floors of open atriums and foyers shall not be included.
Sec. 7.1.104 Height
A. Buildings. Building height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average finished grade along the
front building line to:
1. The highest peak or ridge line of the roof for pitched roof styles; or
2. The top of the parapet for flat roof systems.
B. Other Structures. Structure height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average finished grade
around the base of the structure to the highest point on the structure. This measurement applies to:
1. Structures without roofs (e.g., fences); and
2. Amateur radio antennae, whether mounted on a roof, the ground, or another structure.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 321
C. Specialized Structures and Building Appurtenances.
1. Specialized structures and building appurtenances are not counted in the calculation of building height, provided
that:
a. They project not more than:
1. Fifteen feet above the highest point on the building for buildings that are two stories in height or higher;
or
2. Seven feet above the highest point on the building for buildings that are less than two stories in height.
b. They occupy not more than 10 percent of the total roof area of the building; and
c. They are not used for human habitation, nonresidential, or industrial purposes, except as incidental to the
operation of the building.
2. For the purposes of this Subsection, "specialized structures and building appurtenances" means:
a. Roof structures for the housing of elevators, stairways, tanks, or similar equipment required to operate and
maintain the building;
b. Architectural towers, steeples, flagpoles, ventilating fans, chimneys, smokestacks (except as provided in
Subsection D., below);
c. Skylights, solar panels, and solar water heaters; and
d. Satellite dishes and antennae that are regulated by Section 5.1.102, Satellite Dishes and Antennae.
D. Smokestacks. Smokestacks shall be permitted to a height of 90 feet in the IG district. In other districts, they are
subject to Subsection C., above.
Sec. 7.1.105 Lot Area
Lot area is calculated as the area within the property lines of a lot (see Figure 7.1.105, Illustrative Lot Area Calculation).
Lot area is used:
A. To calculate lot coverage;
B. To calculate floor area ratio; and
C. To determine compliance with minimum lot area requirements, such as in the design of new subdivision.
Figure 7.1.105
Illustrative Lot Area Calculation
Example:
The example at right is a rectangular
lot.
65 ft. wide x 125 ft. deep = 8,125 sq.
ft. lot area
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 322
Sec. 7.1.106 Lot Coverage
A. Lot Coverage. The measurements of lot coverage are as follows.
1. Measurements for buildings and structures are taken on a horizontal plane at the main grade level of the
principal building or structure and all accessory buildings or structures. All dimensions are measured between
the exterior faces of walls.
2. Measurements for driveways, walkways, parking lots, and other non-elevated structures (e.g., pools) are taken
using the area delineated by the improved hard surface.
B. Lot Coverage Ratio. Lot coverage ratio is lot coverage divided by lot area (see Figure 7.1.106, Lot Coverage Ratio
Illustration).
Figure 7.1.106
Lot Coverage Ratio Illustration
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 323
Sec. 7.1.107 Lot Width
A. Generally. Lot width is measured from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line at the front setback line (see
Figure 7.1.107A, Measurement of Lot Width; Standard Lots).
Figure 7.1.107A
Measurement of Lot Width; Standard Lots
B. Corner Lots. Lot width is measured from the interior side lot line to the side street lot line along the front building
line, minus the difference between the street yard setback and the side yard setback (see Figure 7.1.107B,
Measurement of Lot Width; Corner Lots).
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 324
Figure 7.1.107B
Measurement of Lot Width; Corner Lots
C. Irregular Lots. Lot width is the distance from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line along the tangent of the
curve representing the front building line (see Figure 7.1.107C, Measurement of Lot Width; Irregular Lots). Generally,
the front building line is the front setback line. However, if an alternative front building line has been established on
the plat of a subdivision that is more distant than the front setback line from the front property line, then the lot
width is measured at the alternative front building line.
Figure 7.1.107C
Measurement of Lot Width; Irregular Lots
Sec. 7.1.108 Open Space Ratio (OSR) and Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR)
A. Generally. Open Space Ratio (OSR) and Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR) are related concepts. OSR applies to
residential development, and refers to commonly owned open space (open space that is not located on private lots).
LSR applies to landscaped areas in nonresidential development. OSR and LSR are not necessarily a measure of
"green" open space on a parcel proposed for development, as it may also refer to areas of open water. The following
delineations further define what can or cannot be counted as open space or landscape surface.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 325
1. Allowable Areas. Bufferyard requirements, parking lot landscaping, natural resource protection standards,
stormwater management systems, passive recreation areas, and other requirements of this UDC that require
common areas to be landscaped or remain undeveloped shall count as open space or landscape surface area,
and may, in the aggregate, require more open space than the OSR or LSR would require.
2. Prohibited Areas.
a. Open spaces that do not qualify for the calculation of OSR include any areas on private, buildable lots and
any commonly-owned open space that is less than 320 contiguous square feet.
b. Open spaces that do not qualify for the calculation of LSR include any area that is less than 320 contiguous
square feet and areas set aside for parking spaces that are intended for future development.
B. Calculation.
1. Open Space Ratio. OSR is calculated by dividing the total amount of commonly-owned open space on the
residential parcel proposed for development by the total area of the entire parcel proposed for development.
See Figure 7.1.108A, Illustrative Measurement of Open Space Ratio (OSR).
2. Landscape Surface Ratio. LSR is calculated by dividing the total amount of landscaped and open space area on a
nonresidential parcel proposed for development by the entire area of the parcel proposed for development. See
Figure 7.1.108B, Illustrative Measurement of Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR).

Sec. 7.1.109 Setbacks
A. Standard Lots. Setbacks are measured from lot lines towards the center of the lot (see Figure 7.1.109A, Setbacks on
Standards Lots), as follows:
1. Front setbacks (abbreviated "SF") are measured from the front lot line. The front lot line is the lot line that abuts
the right-of-way from which the lot takes its address. For corner lots with standard curb radii, the front setback is
not measured from the curved portion of the lot (however, a portion of this area is included in the required sight
triangle).
2. Rear setbacks (abbreviated "SR") are measured from the rear lot line. The rear lot line is the lot line that is
opposite from the front lot line.
3. Side setbacks (abbreviated "S1" and "S2") are measured from side lot lines. Side lot lines are lot lines that
intersect with front lot lines.
4. Street side setbacks (abbreviated "SS") are measured from street side lot lines.

Setbacks on Standard Lots
B. Odd-Shaped Lots. Setbacks are measured from lot lines towards the center of the lot, as follows, and as depicted in
Figure 7.1.109B, Setbacks on Odd-Shaped Lots:
1. Generally, setbacks are measured as set out in Subsection A., above.
2. Where lot lines are curvilinear, setbacks shall be measured as offsets from the curvilinear lot line.
3. Where there are multiple rear lot lines, the rear setback is measured as offsets from the multiple rear lot lines.
4. Where there is no rear lot line, the rear setback shall be measured as a radial distance from the intersection of
side lot lines at the rear of the lot.
5. Where the front lot line is an arc, the street side setback area is defined as the area behind the front building line
along the arc of the street.

Sec. 7.1.110 Sign Area
A. Generally. Sign area is calculated by computing the entire area of the smallest, square, circle, rectangle, or triangle
that encompasses the outer limited of the sign face, including any open areas within the sign face or faces
individually. The area excludes the structure upon which the sign is placed (unless the structure is an integral part of
the display or used to differentiate it). When the signage consists of individual letters, comprising individual words
on a building, the area is calculated by computing the smallest square, circle, rectangle, or triangle that will
encompass each word, logo, or symbol. The open spaces between words or other individual components is not
included in the calculation (see Figure 7.1.110A, Sign Area).
Figure 7.1.110A
Sign Area
The sign area of the following signs is measured as A x B,
or in the case of a round sign, the circumference measured by the sign radii.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 330
B. Maximum Permitted Sign Area. The maximum permitted sign area for a premises is set out as a numerical limit or as
a function of the frontage of the premises on a street or private street. For properties with frontage on more than
one street or private street, the total frontage shall be calculated as the longest frontage plus one-half the length of
all additional frontages.
C. Double-Faces. For projecting or double-faced signs (see Figure 7.1.110B, Sign Area, Illustration of Double-Faced
Signs, below), only one display face is measured in computing sign area which the sign faces are parallel, or where
the interior angle formed by the faces is 60 degrees or less, provided that the signs are mounted on the same
structure. If the two faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area
of the larger face.
Figure 7.1.110B
Sign Area, Illustration of Double-Faced Signs
Sec. 7.1.111 Signable Area and Ratio
A. Signable Area.
1. Wall Signs. A two-dimensional area on the facade of a building that describes the largest square, rectangle, or
parallelogram which is free of architectural details.
2. Window Signs. The area of glass within a window frame.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 331
3. Other Signs. The area of the face of a sign which is designed to be used for text and graphics (the signable area
does not include the signs supporting frame or structure, if any, provided that such frame or structure is not
designed to display text or graphics).
a. The sign area for ground signs, monument signs, and architectural sign bands are calculated as the area
enclosing the extreme limits of the copy only.
b. In the case of individual letters mounted to a wall, only the total area of the letters themselves is included
with the sign area.
c. In the case of multi-prism indexing sign, sign area is calculated as the area within the perimeter enclosing the
extreme limits of the sign face, regardless of the number of individual messages displayed on the sign.
B. Signable Area Ratio. Signable area ratio is the sign area divided by the signable area. It is expressed as a percentage.
C. Relationship Between Maximum Sign Area and Maximum Area Ratio. Where both a maximum sign area and a
maximum signable area ratio are set out, the standards that results in the least sign area applies.
Sec. 7.1.112 Sign Clearance
Sign clearance is the distance between the bottom of a sign and the nearest point on the surface under it (see Figure
7.1.112, Sign Clearance).
Figure 7.1.112
Sign Clearance
Sec. 7.1.113 Sign Height
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 332
A. Generally. Sign height is the distance from the average grade of the surface under the sign to the top of the sign or
sign structure, whichever is higher. However, chains or brackets that suspend a single sign from a horizontal plane of
the building, awning, or canopy are not counted.
B. Monument Signs. The height of monument signs is measured as provide in this Section, unless the surface under the
sign is lower than the centerline of the abutting street, in which case the height is measured from the average
elevation of the centerline of the abutting street along the frontage of the parcel proposed for development to the
top of the sign or sign structure, whichever is higher (see Figure 7.1.113 , Monument Sign Height).

CHAPTER 20 INTERIM REGULATIONS
DIVISION 20.1.100 TITLE, PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, APPLICABILITY, AND
TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 20.1.101 Title
A. Title. This document shall be officially known as the "City of Richmond Interim Regulations."
B. Short Title. This document may be referred to herein as the "these regulations."
Sec. 20.1.102 Purpose, Duration, and Findings
A. Purpose.
1. The purpose of these interim regulations is to permit development to continue during the preparation of a
Unified Development Code (UDC) while ensuring that all future development is consistent with the draft and
adopted Comprehensive Master Plan and its principles, policies, objectives, and recommendations, as well as
"official drafts" of the new UDC.
2. To achieve this, in an interim period and until the new UDC is adopted, all new development, whether by using a
metes and bounds description in a deed of conveyance or in a contract for a deed, by using a contract of sale or
other executor contract to convey, or by using any other method, with certain exceptions and exemptions, is
hereby required to obtain approval of a development plat. Such development plat shall be in accordance with
the Citys applicable plans, rules, and ordinances. The purpose of this requirement to submit and obtain approval
of a development plat is to ensure that:
a. The development is designed to be consistent with the principles, policies, objectives, and recommendations
of the Comprehensive Master Plan, and adhere to the rules and ordinances pertaining to the development or
improvement of land within the City limits or in the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) of the City;
b. The development plat meets or exceeds the general design objectives of these regulations; and
c. The development plat conforms to the most recent "official draft" of the UDC.
B. Duration. These interim regulations are in effect until the City Commission either repeals the regulations or adopts
the UDC, whichever comes first.
C. Findings. The following findings support the need and justification for immediate adoption of these interim
regulations.
1. In May 2013, the citizens of Richmond adopted a Home Rule Charter, established the legal authority to
implement zoning, and expanded the City's authority on annexation. These proactive actions provided the legal
framework and authority for these regulations.
2. The City is located in Fort Bend County, Texas, the fifth fastest growing county in the U.S. since 2010 and which
has a 15.2 percent projected growth rate. As a direct impact, the City has been experiencing fast-paced growth in
the development of subdivisions within the ETJ. At the same time, the City's existing housing stock within the
City limits is aging (i.e., over 62 percent are 40 years or older), which will require a regulatory framework to
incentive reinvestment as these neighborhoods continue to mature.
3. Recent economic stimulus (e.g., feeder road improvements) and development (e.g., the new Justice Center) has
increased traffic demands, provided access to valuable undeveloped tracts of land, and provided impetus for
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 401
new multi-modal transportation improvements, which are supported by approximately two-thirds of City
residents.
4. Public participation efforts associated with the Comprehensive Master Plan have called for such things as
improving the quality and appearance of corridors and entranceways; pedestrian and bicycle connectivity;
downtown revitalization; protection of the City's rural, historic character; among other important components of
City livability that are related to and impacted by development regulations.
Sec. 20.1.103 Authority
The City of Richmond Interim Regulations are adopted and enforced pursuant to the authority established in Section
2.04, General Enumeration of Powers, of the City's Home Rule Charter, which was adopted pursuant to Article XI, Section
5 of the Constitution of the State of Texas, and such additional authority as may be conferred by the Texas Statutes.
Sec. 20.1.104 Jurisdiction
A. Generally. The provisions of these regulations apply to all land, development, and the use of all land, buildings, and
structures as set out in this Section and in accordance with Section 20.1.105, Applicability, unless specifically
exempted herein or preempted by state or federal law.
B. City Limits. These regulations apply to all areas within the corporate limits of the City of Richmond, Texas.
C. Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. These regulations apply to all areas within the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) in
conformance with the following.
1. To promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the City and the safe, orderly, and healthful
development of the City, it is the intent of the City Commission to fully exercise the authority granted to home
rule municipalities by the Texas Statutes, including:
a. The exercise of the following powers within the entire designated ETJ, as may be amended from time to
time:
1. Plat approvals, pursuant to Sections 212.002, 212.003, and 242.001, Tex. Local Govt Code and related
authorizations.

seq. and 216.902, Tex. Local Govt Code.
6. Regulation of parking, landscaping, and architecture, pursuant to Section 212.044, Tex. Local Gov't Code.
7. Regulation of prohibiting the firing of fireworks in the area within 5,000 feet of the City limits, pursuant to
Sections 217.003 and 217.042, Tex. Local Govt Code.
b. The regulation of equipment and operation of rendering plants within the City and within one mile of the City
limits, pursuant to Section 215.003, Tex. Local Govt Code.
c. The definition and prohibition of nuisances, including the power to summarily abate and remove nuisances,
in the area within 5,000 feet of the City limits, pursuant to Section 217.042, Tex. Local Govt Code.
2. The City does not regulate use or density within the ETJ. However, it does apply other standards of these
regulations based on the use of property in the ETJ, generally through the requirement of a subdivision plat or
development plat. The following standards apply within the ETJ:
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 402

Sec. 20.1.109 "Official Draft" of the Interim Regulations and Unified Development Code
When a draft chapter of the Comprehensive Master Plan and when a draft of individual chapters, articles, divisions, or
sections of the new Unified Development Code (UDC) are submitted and stamped "received" by the City Manager, or a
designee, the drafts of the Comprehensive Master Plan and UDC are hereinafter considered to be "official drafts" of the
plans, rules, and ordinances of the City. Thereafter, the "official drafts" may be used to determine the consistency and
conformance of development with these plans, rules, and regulations. Any revisions to the Comprehensive Master Plan
or UDC that are identified by the Planning and Zoning Commission and recommended to the City Commission shall
therein become the "official draft" upon revision and receipt by the City Manager, or a designee. However, no individual

approved by the City Commission.
DIVISION 20.1.200 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 405
Sec. 20.1.201 Design Objectives, Generally
A. Generally. Because the Comprehensive Master Plan and new UDC are not yet complete, and the degree of
incompletion will lessen over time, the following general design objectives will be used in the review of development
plats, together with the "official drafts" and the City's and WFBMD current regulations.
B. Good Practices. The design of the parcel proposed for development demonstrates good land planning and site
engineering practices.
C. Quality of Place. The design of the site and its buildings create a quality of place that is of equal or greater standard
to that of other places in the region that are recognized for a quality aesthetic, and that are unique and which
contribute to the character and charm of Richmond. This is to be accomplished through good architectural design,
aesthetic treatments, and site amenities, all of which promote character, visual interest, and dignity to embrace the
quality of life and strengthen the wellbeing of the community.
D. Adjacency. The site and building design protect abutting uses from adverse impacts of the parcel proposed for
development by an appropriate placement of the building and with adequate bufferyards to screen and separate it
from abutting and nearby properties, particularly when the abutting properties include low density residential
neighborhoods.
E. Landscaping. Existing vegetation is protected and preserved to the maximum extent practicable and additional trees
and shrubs are planted to enhance the site appearance, break-up expanses of building walls, screen parking and
vehicular use areas, provide shade to reduce the heat-island effect, prevent soil erosion, and improve water quality.
F. Nuisances. Lighting and environmental controls (e.g., noise, light pollution, dust, and debris, etc.) are designed in a
manner so as to promote a quality environment and protect the value and enjoyment of neighboring properties
while avoiding any nuisances that detract from the livability of these properties.
G. Access. Access to the parcel proposed for development is adequately controlled to preserve safe and efficient traffic
flows, maintain the traffic carrying capacity and level of service of the abutting street(s), and minimize or mitigate
traffic and pedestrian conflicts.
H. Circulation. Site circulation is designed so as to provide off-street access to and from abutting parcels, to effectively
direct the flow of traffic to and through the site, and to handle the parking and loading requirements of the subject
use.
I. Pedestrian Safety. Safe pedestrian access is provided by way of sidewalks, crosswalks, trail or pathway connections,
and/or pedestrian precincts across individual sites and throughout the parcel proposed for development.
J. Landscape Surface. Adequate landscape surface areas are provided for tree preservation, site landscaping,
streetscaping, and the screening and shading of parking lots; building and parking lot setbacks; and to collect,
infiltrate, and convey stormwater.
K. Resource Protection. Site resources including, but not limited to woodlands, wetlands, waterbodies, watercourses,
and other areas of scenic or environmental significance are preserved and protected, and any significant intrusions
or harmful effects are, in this order, avoided, minimized, and mitigated.
L. Stormwater Management. Stormwater management facilities and improvements are designed not only for their
function and utility but also as a site amenity and positive contribution to the landscape.
M. Flood Protection. Floodplains are protected from unsuitable development so as to minimize losses due to
destruction by nature or acts of God. Lots, parcels, or tracts that are located, in whole or in part, in the floodplain
shall have engineered plans to prevent future flooding of buildings and to make improvements that provide for
adequate access during flood events.
Sec. 20.1.202 General Nuisance Standards
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 406
A. Generally. All uses and activities permitted by these regulations within the City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction
(ETJ) shall conform to the standards of this Section, using adequate and appropriate prevention and/or mitigation
techniques as necessary.
B. Noise. No use shall be permitted that causes serious annoyance to occupants of abutting properties due to excessive
noise.
C. Vibration. No use shall be permitted which produces ground vibrations noticeable without instruments at the lot
line of the premises on which the use is located.
D. Smoke Emissions. All uses shall comply with local, state and federal regulations pertaining to the emission of smoke.
E. Odors. No use shall be permitted to produce the emission of objectionable or offensive odors in such concentration
as to be readily perceptible at any point at or beyond the lot line of the property on which the use is located, subject
to applicable state air quality regulations.
F. Dust and Debris. Uses shall be maintained in an orderly condition and conducted in a manner that avoids the spread
of dust, debris, and litter to other properties and public rights-of-way. Hazardous materials, refuse, or items that can
be carried away by wind or water shall be secured in buildings, structures, or other such enclosure.
G. Toxic or Noxious Matter. No use shall for any period of time discharge across boundaries of a lot line on which it is
located, toxic or noxious matter in such concentrations as to be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
comfort, or welfare, or cause injury or damage to persons, property, or the use of property or land, or render
unclean the waters of the state to the extent of being harmful or inimical to public health, animal or aquatic life, or
the use of such waters for domestic water supply, recreation, or other legitimate and necessary uses. Disposal of
toxic or hazardous waste within the City is specifically prohibited.
H. Nuclear Radiation. Any operation involving radiation (i.e., the use of gamma rays, x-rays, alpha and beta particles,
high speed electrons, neutrons, protons, and other atomic or nuclear particles), shall be permitted only in
accordance with state and federal laws, rules, and regulations, or any other applicable regulation.
I. Electromagnetic Radiation and Interference. No person shall operate or cause to be operated for any purpose a
planned or unplanned source of electromagnetic radiation which does not comply with the current regulations of
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding such sources of electromagnetic radiation. No use, activity,
or process shall be conducted which produces electromagnetic interference with normal radio or television
reception.
J. Heat or Glare. Any activity producing heat or glare shall be carried on in such a manner that such heat or glare is not
perceptible at any lot line. Exposed sources of light, including bare bulbs and tubes and immediately adjacent
reflecting surfaces, shall be shielded to avoid creating a nuisance across lot lines. The light intensity from illumination
of any kind shall not exceed fifty-foot lamberts at any point along the line of the lot containing the light source.
Sec. 20.1.203 Manufactured Home Parks and Subdivisions
The City Commission has determined that there shall be a prohibition of new manufactured homes and mobile homes
on lots outside of designated manufactured home parks or subdivisions within the City limits and the extraterritorial
jurisdiction (ETJ). As such, Ord. No. 2011-10, Manufactured Home Ordinances, is included by way of reference with the
exception of Article XIV, Recreational Vehicles, where new recreational vehicle parks are instead, subject to the
standards set out in Section 20.1.204, Recreational Vehicle Parks, of these regulations.
Sec. 20.1.204 Recreational Vehicle Parks
A. Generally. Recreational vehicle parks (RV parks) shall be designed according to the standards of this Section.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 407
B. Purpose and Intent. The City Commission finds that RV parks can contribute to the City's long-term economic and
social well-being if they are properly located, designed, and maintained to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the RV park users, abutting properties, and the City as a whole.
C. Minimum and Maximum Site Area.

20.1.212E, Bufferyards, and shall contain an eight foot tall masonry wall that is designed and constructed
with the same primary exterior finish materials of the principal building; or
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 420
b. The loading area is enclosed by a roof and a wall between the building and the property boundary line (i.e., a
"loading shed"). The buffer between the loading shed and the property boundary line may be reduced by one
level of opacity adjoining the loading shed, and may be the standard "use" bufferyard elsewhere.
D. Exemptions. The loading requirements of this Section may be exempted for good cause shown upon demonstration
by the applicant of a proposed use and the nature of its business and operations. However, as determined by the
Code Official, or upon request of the City Commission at the behest of the Code Official, it may be required of the
applicant to reserve sufficient land for loading space if there is a reasonable likelihood that the use or the nature of
the use could change in a manner warranting loading space.

A. General Provisions.
1. Short Title.
2. Purpose.
a. The City Commission, in order to promote a positive image of the City and surrounding areas to reflect
harmony and order, finds that it is appropriate to regulate signs and to provide uniform sign standards.
b. New businesses and industries are increasingly basing their decisions to locate in a particular area on the
quality of life in that area. Regulation of visual clutter can help to preserve this quality and promote the

jurisdiction.
c. The City Commission recognizes that the proliferation of signs without reasonable regulation and control can
create a hazardous driving condition by distracting the motoring public.
d. In enacting these regulations, special notice has been taken of the often competing viewpoints of citizens
and the sign industry, particularly that part of the industry engaged in billboard operations. These regulations
have been designed to protect and accommodate both concerns.
e. Therefore, the general objective of these regulations are to promote health, safety, welfare, convenience,
and enjoyment of the public while recognizing that the reasonable and orderly display of signs is a necessary

Sec. 20.1.212 Landscaping, Buffering, and Tree Preservation
A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Section is to establish landscaping standards that protect and preserve the
appearance and character of the City, protect the health and quality of life of the residents through the preservation
of protected trees, and conserve scarce water resources by promoting the planting of native and drought-resistant
trees and shrubs. In establishing these standards, it is the City Commission's intent to encourage the preservation of
trees and their value to the community, increase the compatibility of abutting uses, and to minimize the effects on
the surrounding environment due to noise, dust, debris, artificial light intrusions, and other impacts of an abutting or
nearby use.
B. Applicability of Standards. This Section applies to all new development, redevelopment, and substantial
improvements in the City and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), and where specifically indicated, to existing trees and
landscaping.
C. Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the standards of this Section:
1. Individual lots of record that are used for existing single-family detached or attached dwellings, or duplexes,
unless required by this Section.
2. Modifications to nonresidential buildings where the building expansion or redevelopment does not exceed the
gross floor area of the existing building by more than 10 percent or 3,000 square feet, whichever is less.
3. Sites that are proposed for redevelopment or substantial improvement, where due to the geometry of the site or
existing improvements, installation of landscaping in compliance within this Section would be impractical or
unreasonable, in which case the City's professional reviewer may approve a lesser landscaping requirement,
provided that the reduction of landscaping standards is only the extent necessary to make the installation
practicable. In no case shall this exception be interpreted to lessen these requirements for reasons other than
those provided.
D. Approved Plant Lists. Only plants set out in Appendix D, Industrial Development and Redevelopment Standards
Suggested Plant Palette, of the WFBMD District Standards count towards the landscape requirements of this Section.
The use of native, disease- and drought-resistant varieties of plant materials is strongly encouraged.
E. Buffering. The bufferyards required between areas of different uses that are required by these regulations are based
on the amount of screening (i.e., opacity) they provide. Bufferyards are classified from less screening (Type A) to
more screening (Type D).
1. Bufferyard Options. There are two bufferyards options. Landscape only bufferyards are the preferred option and
use a higher density of plant material to screen abutting properties. For properties more constrained by size, a
second option provides a similar level of screening, but allows a berm, wall, or fence to be used in conjunction
with a smaller width of landscape strip and lower density plant material. Each option identifies the width of the
buffer and the numbers and types of plants required per 100 linear feet, or portion thereof. The minimum
planting requirements for each type and composition of bufferyard are set out in Table 20.1.212A, Bufferyard
Classifications.

Type D (65%) 25' 3 5 5 25 3' berm
TABLE NOTES:
N/A - Not Applicable.
1 A berm, wall, or fence is not required for landscape only bufferyards.
2 Plant material, except large trees, must be installed on the outside of the wall or fence facing the street or abutting properties.
2. Use Bufferyards. Set out in Table 20.1.212B, Use Bufferyards, are the required bufferyards between properties
(delineated by types of uses) that are not separated by a public or private street. Landscaping along property
lines that are bordered by a public or private street are subject to the landscaping requirements set out in
Subsection F., Development Landscaping, of this Section. The rows show the use of the parcel proposed for
development and columns show the use of the abutting land. Two letters are shown for each condition. The
bufferyard required for the parcel proposed for development is listed first. The letter listed second is the buffer
that is or may be required on the abutting property when it is developed, redeveloped, or substantially improved
in the future. Where "-" is found there is no use bufferyard required.

3. Existing Abutting Development without Bufferyards. Where the abutting property is an existing single-family
detached, duplex, or other single-family attached residential property or existing development that does not
have the required use boundary bufferyard, the proposed mixed-use, nonresidential, multi-family, or
public/institutional development shall provide a bufferyard of the next higher classification (e.g., if the
requirement is a Type B bufferyard, then the screening of the parcel proposed for development shall be a Type C
bufferyard).
F. Development Landscaping. In addition to the buffering requirements set out in Subsection E., above, all
nonresidential, mixed-use, multi-family, and public/institutional uses shall be landscaped per the requirements set
out in Subsection F. 1., Parking Lot Landscaping, and Subsection F.2., Site Landscaping, of this Section.

4.3RESPONSIBILITY FOR INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE IN EXISTING DEVELOPMENTS
A. Existing developments are those developments where formal application for City approval, usually in the form of
submittal of a set of construction plans, has been made as of the date of final adoption of this Chapter, or those
developments that are already in existence at the time of adoption of this Chapter regardless of whether City
approval was given, to the extent such development is already in place or to the extent application for City approval
has already been made.
B. Installation and maintenance of street lights by the City in existing developments shall be contingent upon the
average daily traffic count, stage of development, street design, existing illumination levels and budgeted funds.
C. In no case shall the standards in this Chapter be interpreted to mean that existing street lights already installed or
proposed in existing developments be removed, relocated, or otherwise changed unless the current street light
layout of an existing development is to be substantially altered from the condition in place at the time of the
adoption of this policy. In such instances, the new layout will conform to the technical standards set forth in this
policy.
D. In existing residential and commercial developments where street lights are installed or proposed to be installed
throughout the development, or a section thereof, by the developer or homeowners association (HOA) of the
development or section, the developer or HOA shall maintain and ensure the proper illumination in accordance with
this policy of the street lighting, including paying of the installation and the monthly utility cost therefore, until 80%
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 26
of the land area is built out as reflected by the City's tax rolls, or for a period of three years after the initial use of the
street lights, whichever occurs first. Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of the City to maintain the street lights in
a manner consistent with this policy.
E. In existing residential and commercial developments or sections thereof, where street lights have not been installed
nor are proposed to be installed by the developer or HOA, the City may opt to provide for the installation and
maintenance of street lighting, including ensuring the proper illumination thereof and paying the monthly utility
costs beginning the fourth year following final plat or plan approval, or after 80% of the land area is built out as
reflected by the City's tax rolls, whichever occurs first.
F. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein regarding existing developments, along existing major
thoroughfares or a portion thereof where street lights have not been installed nor are proposed to be installed, the
City shall provide for the installation and maintenance of street lights, including proper illumination and paying the
monthly utility costs therefore, when the average daily traffic count, stage of development, street design, existing
illumination levels and budgeted funds allow for same, as determined by the City.
4.4RESPONSIBILITY FOR INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE IN NEW DEVELOPMENTS
A. New developments are those developments where formal application for City approval or conditional approval,
usually in the form of submission of a preliminary plat or a conceptual plan, has not been made as of the date of
adoption of this chapter. The developer shall include a street light layout plan, conforming to the provisions of this
policy, with the construction plans submitted for approval by the City.
B. In all new residential and commercial developments, the developer shall be responsible for the installation and
maintenance, including the proper illumination, of street lights along all streets or portions of streets. Such
maintenance includes the payment of all utility charges for the operation and maintenance of street lights, and such
utility charges shall be paid directly to the electrical service provider serving the street lights. Such street light
installation and maintenance period shall be from prior to the end of the one (1) year maintenance period for the
streets and continue until 80% of the platted lots are built out, as reflected by the City tax rolls, or for a period of
three years from the acceptance of the streets for permanent maintenance by the City, whichever occurs first.
Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of the City to maintain street lights in new residential developments and new
commercial developments in a manner consistent with this policy.
C. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein regarding new developments, the developer of property adjacent
to a major thoroughfare or of property within which all or a portion of a major thoroughfare is situated or proposed,
shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance, including ensuring the proper illumination, of street lights
along the major thoroughfare for the length of the major thoroughfare along which the development is situated.
When a developer develops only on one side of a major thoroughfare, he is required to install and maintain
approximately half of the number of street lights required for said length of thoroughfare. The responsibility to
install and maintain street lights as set forth herein by the developer continues until the end of the one-year street
maintenance period. During that time, the monthly utility charge for the street lights is the responsibility of the
developer, and is paid directly to the retail electric provider. Thereafter, it is the responsibility of the City to maintain
street lights along the major thoroughfare or portion thereof in a manner consistent with this policy.
4.5ORNAMENTAL STREET LIGHTS
A. To the extent that street lighting is designed to exceed and/or deviate from these Standards, it shall be considered
ornamental lighting. Ornamental lighting shall be allowed as a variance from these Standards in accordance with
Section 1.10 hereof. In no event shall the street lighting layout and design be below the standards set forth in this
Chapter, nor exceed the standards set by the Illuminating Engineering Society. If the cost for installing and/or
maintaining such ornamental lights exceeds the cost for lights installed in accordance with the City standards, the
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 27
costs above the City standard shall be paid in perpetuity by the developer, homeowner association, or property
owner association, under contract directly with the service provider. A written agreement between the developer,
homeowner association, or property owner association and the electrical service provider must be submitted prior
to the issuance of a construction permit.
B. The city standard for street lights on curb-and-gutter streets and in new developments is the cobra head street
light mounted on a smooth, 35-foot or 40-foot metal pole. In areas where wooden poles and overhead lines are
already prevalent, street lights may be located on existing wooden poles. Street lights that are not cobra head
lights or that are not mounted above 30 feet are considered ornamental street lights.
C. The installation, operation and maintenance of ornamental street lights shall not be the responsibility of the City of
Richmond.

7.3 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
A. Storm Water Goals: The goal of all drainage design within the city limits and the extra- territorial jurisdiction of
Richmond is the prevention of structure flooding and the maintenance of one lane passable in each direction on
major thoroughfares during a 100-year storm event. This is accomplished through application of various drainage
enhancements, such as storm sewers, roadside ditches, open channels, detention and overland (sheet) run-off. The
combined system is intended to prevent structural flooding from extreme events up to a 100-year storm.
Recognizing that each site has unique differences that can enhance the opportunity to provide proper drainage, the
intent of these criteria is to specify minimum requirements that can be modified provided that the objective for
drainage standards is maintained. Street ponding of short duration is anticipated and designed to contribute to the
overall drainage capability of the system. Storm sewers and roadside ditch conduits are designed as a balance of
capacity and economics. These conduits are designed to convey less intense, more frequent rainfalls with the intent
of allowing for traffic movement during these events. When rainfall events exceed the capacity of the storm sewer
system, the additional run-off shall be stored or conveyed overland in a manner that reduces the threat of flooding
to structures and maintains mobility on major thoroughfares. All storm water systems shall also be designed to be in
conformance with the City of Richmond Storm Water Quality Manual.
B. All drainage projects within the City shall be tied to a National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and a datum adjustment shall
be provided, if necessary, between the NGS datum and the governing FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map.
C. Drawing sets shall include a drainage area map, which will contain calculations of flow by the rational method.
D. Drainage systems for curb-and-gutter pavements shall be underground closed conduits; individual residential lot
drainage is exempt. Drainage systems for pavements without curb and gutter shall be roadside open-ditch sections.
Open-ditch drainage requires specific approval of the Department of Public Works.
E. Storm water systems shall be designed in accordance with the FBCDD Criteria Manual as appropriate for the location
of the property. Other criteria may be submitted for consideration by variance. It is the submitters responsibility to
fully justify any requested variance.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 56
F. The system hydraulic calculations for the storm sewer design storm and the 100-year storm, including design storm
hydraulic grade line calculations, sealed by a Texas Registered Professional Engineer, shall be provided with all storm
water system plans. An electronic spreadsheet shall be submitted showing pipe sizes, material, design criteria and
calculations for each section (manhole-to-manhole) of the storm water system.
G. Private storm water systems along private streets shall be designed to the standards of public storm water systems.
H. The lowest chord of all bridges shall be a minimum of twelve inches (12) above the 100- year water surface
elevation, or, at or above the level of natural ground, or in accordance with the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (F.E.M.A.) regulations latest revisions, whichever is greater.
I. All storm sewer designs and drainage plans for new developments shall include protection from the 100-year storm
event through the use of positive overflow pathways. All positive overflow pathways for extreme events shall be
contained within exclusive reserves and shall not be part of a residential lot unless the 100-year event is contained
within a below grade conduit. If the 100-year event is contained within a below grade conduit, then the conduit shall
be within the right-of-way and/or an exclusive storm sewer easement as outlined in Section 7.05.
7.4 STORM SEWER DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
A. Design Frequency
1. Newly Developed Areas: The minimum design storm event for sizing storm sewers in newly developing areas will
be in accordance with the current, applicable county drainage manual.
2. Redevelopment or In-fill Development: The existing storm drain will be evaluated using the requirements of the
applicable county drainage design manual assuming no development takes place. The storm drain will then be
evaluated with the development in place.
a. If the proposed redevelopment has a lower or equal impervious cover, no modifications to the existing storm
drain are required.
b. If the hydraulic gradient of the existing storm drain is below the top of curb, no improvements to the existing
storm drain are required.
c. If the hydraulic gradient is above the top of curb, and no structures are threatened, the applicant must check
with the City to see if a Capital Improvement Project is proposed that will require a capital contribution. If no
Capital Improvement Project is in place for the subject system and no structural flooding is threatened by the
project and the amount of street ponding meets City criteria, then no improvements to the existing storm
drain are required.
d. If the hydraulic gradient indicates that structures are threatened by flooding, the applicant has the option of
either making improvements to the existing storm drain or providing on-site detention.
B. Storm sewers shall have a minimum clearance of six inches (6) from all other utilities. The clearance shall be

7.7 STORM WATER DETENTION REQUIREMENTS
A. The intention of storm water detention is to mitigate the effect of the new development on an existing drainage
system. An engineer may provide calculations using acceptable design criteria to show that the impact can be
mitigated using detention criteria different from the requirements of the FBCDD Criteria Manual.
B. Application of Detention
All development/redevelopment must be designed in a way that mitigates the effects of the development on other
properties. In other words, post-development peak runoff for the design storm(s) event must be less than or equal
to pre-development peak runoff. This will be accomplished through the use of on-site storm water detention
facilities designed to mitigate storms up to and including the 100-year (1%) event. In some watersheds where
mitigation is performed on a regional basis, individual detention sites may not be required. It is the responsibility of
the project owner to coordinate with City staff to determine whether regional detention or individual mitigation
facilities are necessary for the development.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 64
The use of on-site detention is required when reported incidence of structural flooding exists, or when in-fill or
redevelopment will result in a potential threat to existing structures unless the current infrastructure is improved, or
when detention is required in accordance with the appropriate, adopted watershed master drainage plan, when
post development flows result in street ponding levels which exceed City requirements, or if in the opinion of the
City Engineer post development flows will have an adverse impact on adjacent properties. If the City has developed a
plan for a regional detention facility to serve a watershed, then the development is responsible for all costs of
constructing the system to convey flows from their project to the regional facility. The City may elect to participate in
oversizing of this conveyance if regional drainage interests are served.
When development occurs within the 100-yr floodplain, compensatory storage within the detention pond is
required to offset the amount of fill placed within the regulatory floodplain.
Detention may not be required under the following conditions.
1. If redevelopment occurs without increasing the overall impervious character of the site, then no detention will
be required by the City unless the application of detention will prevent existing structure flooding or bring the
street ponding level on a major thoroughfare to within City requirements.
2. If the proposed development has less or equal impervious land cover than that used in the design of the storm
sewer system as shown on the drainage area map in the roadway construction plans or other hydraulic
computations.
3. If the hydraulic grade line from the current design storm of the receiving storm sewer system remains below the
elevation of the gutter throughout the system with the proposed development included and considering
ultimate conditions of the storm sewer watershed.
C. Detention volume for redevelopment areas is calculated on the basis of the amount of area of the redeveloped
impervious cover.
D. Private parking areas, private streets, and private storm sewers may be used for detention provided the maximum
depth of flooding does not exceed six inches (6) directly over the inlet. Underground detention facilities may be
proposed for consideration by the City.
E. Calculation of Outlet Size.
1. Detention pond discharge pipe into an existing storm sewer line or existing City of Richmond or other public
entity facility:
a. Maximum pool elevation at or below the design hydraulic grade at the outfall - The discharge line shall be
sized for the Design Storm with the outfall pipe flowing full. The pond will float on the drainage system to
provide maximum benefit.
b. Maximum pool elevation at or above the hydraulic grade at the outfall  Provide a reducer or restrictor pipe
to be constructed inside the discharge line. The discharge line shall be sized for the Design Storm with the
outfall pipe flowing full.
c. Reducer or Restrictor Pipes shall be sized as follows:
i. The reducer or restrictor will be sized for undeveloped rate of discharge at no greater than 0.5 cubic feet
per second per acre unless capacity for a greater flow rate is verified in the receiving system and
approved by the City Engineer.
ii. Use the following equations to calculate the required outflow orifice:
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 65
Q = CA (2g)1/2 (h)1/2
D = Q1/2 / (2.25 h )1/4
Where:
Q = outflow discharge (cfs)
C = 0.8
A = orifice area (square feet)
g = gravitational factor (32.2)
h = head, water surface differential (feet)
D = orifice diameter (feet)
iii. Restrictor shall be either of the required diameter or of the equivalent cross-sectional area. The orifice
diameter D shall be a minimum of 0.5 feet.
d. In addition to a pipe outlet, the detention basin shall be provided with a gravity spillway that will protect
structures from flooding should the detention basin be overtopped.
e. Detention ponds shall maintain a minimum freeboard of one foot (1) between the top of bank and the 100-
year water surface elevation.
f. All outfall pipe configuration must conform to the slope of the receiving ditch and provide slope/erosion
protection.
F. Detention Facility Ownership and Easements.
1. Private Facilities:
a. Pump discharges into a roadside ditch require the submittal of pump specifications on the design drawings.
The maximum discharge rate of pumped facilities to a roadside ditch is 0.5 cubic feet per second unless
capacity for a greater flow rate is verified in the receiving system and approved by the City Engineer. Energy
dissipaters and erosion protection is required for pumped outfalls. Pump station shall include a back-up
pump and emergency power source, and be designed in accordance with Fort Bend County Drainage District
requirements.
b. The City reserves the right to prohibit the use of pump discharges where their use may aggravate flooding in
the public right-of-way.

8.3DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
A. Design Philosophy
Large speed differentials among motor vehicles traveling the same or connecting roadways creates unsafe driving
conditions. Minimizing speed differentials through the proper design of driveway approaches promotes driver and
pedestrian safety. It is the City's policy to require a driveway design that creates no more than a 20 mph maximum
speed differential on roadways. The goal of the City policy is to create a balance between optimal access and safety.
Generally, as the widths of streets and vehicular speeds increase, the number of driveway approaches should
decrease. Driveway approaches accessing major thoroughfares should be situated in a manner that minimizes the
number of potential conflict points. A single piece of property served by multiple driveways may increase speed
differentials and is generally considered undesirable. For commercial development shared commercial driveways
shall be a requirement. Regulated access, removing turning vehicles from the traffic stream and channelization of
traffic should be determined on a site-specific basis, taking into consideration the policies and requirements of the
City and other regulating entities, and following generally-accepted traffic engineering principles.
City policy is to require turn bays and acceleration/deceleration lanes on major thoroughfares or to utilize equally
effective traffic-controlling methods that will minimize speed differential and increase overall safety.

more of the following events:
1. A change in use, or an increase in intensity of use, occurs such that the site requires a ten percent (10%) increase
in required parking spaces.
2. Any modification that changes the design or function of the existing driveway.
3. The addition of a median opening on the public street by a developer. All driveways that are served by the new

9.1GENERAL
A. These standards describe the general requirements for the preparation of a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) for approval
by the City of Richmond.
B. The Richmond Public Works Department shall approve all required traffic impact analyses within the Richmond city
limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction.
C. A TIA is required as a part of the approval process for zoning changes; building permits applications, subdivision
platting or changes of occupancy. A TIA is required at the earliest stage of development process to provide technical
basis for driveway placement and other traffic improvements.
D. Public Works Department personnel will be available for preliminary meetings to discuss a proposed traffic impact
analysis with the project engineer. This preliminary meeting between the City and the engineer should be scheduled
with the Department of Public Works staff prior to submittal of any documents for review. The purpose of this
meeting is to discuss the project concepts and to establish the status of requirements and issues that may be
pertinent to the traffic impact analysis.
E. A TIA, when required, shall be prepared by an individual, group, firm or corporation having demonstrated
professional emphasis and experience in transportation planning, engineering and in the preparation of similar
analyses. The TIA document shall bear the seal and signature of a Texas Registered Professional Engineer.
F. The submitted TIA must be approved by the Department of Public Works. Approval is valid for a period of twentyfour
(24) months, provided significant changes in the development proposal or surrounding conditions have not
occurred.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 74
G. The goal of the traffic impact analysis is that the level of service (LOS) resulting from the new development be no
worse than the existing LOS. Any degradation in LOS shall be mitigated.
9.2 WHEN TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSES ARE REQUIRED
A. At the discretion of the City Engineer, a TIA shall be required for any development proposal expected to generate
traffic volumes that will significantly impact the capacity and/or safety of the transportation network. A TIA may also
be required for a development located near a sensitive area, a high accident location or an area already suffering
from congestion.
B. Proposed developments that are forecasted to generate one or more of the following trip thresholds, based on the
latest version of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, shall be required to conduct a
traffic impact analysis.
1. 750 trips per average weekday (ADT)
2. 100 directional trips during the peak hour of either the traffic generator or the adjacent roadway
3. 50 directional trips during the peak hour of either the traffic generator or the adjacent roadway, if the Level of
Service on the adjacent road network within one-half (½) mile of the traffic generator is below LOS C.
4. Redevelopment, rezoning, additions or changes of occupancy that are expected to increase trip generation or
directional flows by 20% or greater over existing conditions.
C. The following table lists development sizes for typical uses that are assumed to meet the minimum threshold levels
requiring a traffic impact analysis. A traffic impact study can be required at the discretion of the City Engineer, even
if the threshold levels are not met, if based on his professional judgment the development may have an adverse
impact on traffic safety due to the design, location or use of the proposed development.

D. At the discretion of the City Engineer, a full traffic impact analysis (TIA) may not be required if:
1. No safety or capacity problems exist in the immediate vicinity of the development.
2. A prior TIA, prepared for a site located within 1,000 feet, indicates that build-out of vacant tracts will not create
capacity or safety problems on the adjacent street network.
3. The proposed development or use produces less than 50 directional trips during the peak hour of either the
traffic generator or the adjacent roadway and/or;
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 75
4. The proposed development is a reuse of an existing building and the new use produces trips of the same nature
that are less than 120% of the trips generated by the prior use and if no safety or capacity problems exist.
9.3 SCOPE OF REQUIRED TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS (TIA)
A. Prior to beginning a traffic study, the engineer should contact the Department of Public Works to determine the
scope of the work to be performed. The City will work with the developer and the traffic engineer to determine
appropriate assumptions for the analysis. The following items should be considered in the preliminary analysis and
addressed in the TIA:
1. The level of detail needed for the study.
2. Trip generation rates to be used.
3. If pass-by or modal split analysis is required.
4. The need for internal circulation analysis.
5. Reductions to trips due to internal circulation, if appropriate.
6. List of development close to the site to be considered.
7. Assumptions for area wide growth (Background traffic calculation methods).
8. Consideration of phased development and transportation improvements.
9. Identification of study area, land uses and key intersections.
10. Identification of high accident areas.
11. If consideration of pedestrian, bicycle or transit impacts are needed.
12. Analysis period and the typical peak hours for the proposed land use.
13. If a new signal is warranted the existing traffic corridor must be examined for changes that need to be made in
conjunction with the new signal.
14. A feasibility study of placing a roundabout in lieu of a traditional traffic signal is required.
15. If modification is required of an existing traffic signal the timing and phasing must be examined. In addition, a full
analysis of the corridor-wide synchronization will be required. In addition the implementation of the
recommendations called for in the TIA report shall be required.
B. Three levels of study have been identified based on the number of trips that a development is projected to generate
in a 24-hour period (ADT) and during peak hour. The following table is offered as a general guideline of typical
requirements. The City Engineer may have further requirements based on site-specific conditions.

C. The TIA should incorporate all transportation and land development information that is current and available. Table
9-2 from the ITE Traffic Engineering Studies Handbook should be reviewed to determine if any additional
information on background data is needed.
9.4SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
A. A preliminary trip generation assessment of proposed development should be conducted to determine if a traffic
study would be required. If the preliminary assessment indicates that a traffic study will be required, the applicants
should immediately consult with Department of Public Works to verify a development's projected trip generation,
and to confirm whether or not a study will be required. If a study is required, the required level can be determined at
that time along with other necessary parameters.
B. The Department of Public Works shall review the traffic impact analysis in conjunction with the other elements of
the development application. If the draft study is not of the proper scope or is executed improperly, the applicant
shall be notified of the deficiencies and be required to submit corrections on the same schedule that applies to the
other elements of the development application. Failure to submit corrections in a timely fashion may lead to a
postponement of the application.
C. One (1) copy of the final TIA report, along with a PDF copy, including all necessary backup data are required for
review and City approval. Upon receiving City approval an electronic version shall be submitted that includes all data
but not limited to the following: 1) separate traffic count, 2) all Synchro traffic modeling data and 3) all relevant data
files. These files are to be submitted with the final approved TIA.
D. Any traffic study will need to be revised if the proposed land use is changed by type or size. In addition, any traffic
study may need to be revised if the study is older than 2 years and the City Engineer determines that the existing
conditions have changed enough to invalidate the study results or if the initial study assumes an incorrect build out
period.
9.5 FUNDING RESOURCES
A. The (TIA) may take into account the city/state/county approved traffic improvements with dedicated funding. The
City Engineer will determine what approved traffic improvements may be considered. The developer prior to the
issuance of the occupancy permit shall complete any required traffic improvements, which have not been funded or
otherwise completed by the government agencies.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 77
B. When it can be demonstrated that a development will only partially contribute to the need for additional off-site
improvements, the city may require a pro-rated contribution according to the percentage of traffic added by the
development.
C. The City will verify that all traffic improvements to be provided by the developer or property owner have been
completed before a Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued.
9.6 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES REPORT REQUIREMENTS
A. It is recommended that along with the requirements provided in these guidelines, the most recent version of the
following resources should be referenced during the development of a traffic impact study.
1. Highway Capacity Manual
2. Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
3. Trip Generation, ITE
4. Trip Generation Handbook, ITE
5. Trip Generation Users Guide, ITE
6. Traffic Engineering Handbook, ITE
7. Manual of Transportation Engineering Studies, ITE
8. SYNCHRO Traffic Modeling Software
B. This section defines the elements that are required in a TIA. A thorough report shall address each of the items below.
1. Introduction
a. Include a description of the site location and study area, including a location map identifying key
intersections and other approved projects in the vicinity.
b. Development Description shall include type of land use and the following information where applicable:
i. If residential, number and type of dwelling units
ii. If commercial or industrial, square footage and type of development
iii. Detailed site plan
iv. Development phasing and timing
c. Selection of analysis period shall be based on the proposed land use and the typical peak hours. Many nearby
land uses may influence peak times of a particular intersection. For example an intersection near a hospital
may peak during a mid-afternoon shift change rather than the typical pm peak hour. Schools, churches,
hospitals or shipping centers may impact peak periods due to their individual peaking characteristics. Care
should be given to understand the surrounding land uses before deciding upon the peak hours. An
investigation of the daily counts prior to collecting the peak-hour counts would allow a determination of a
typical range of peak hour traffic movements on a roadway facility.
2. Existing Conditions
a. A thorough review of available data and existing conditions at the site shall include at a minimum the
following items:
b. A site visit by the engineer of record.
c. Study area land use
i. Existing land use
ii. Existing zoning
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 78
d. Site access will be shown on the plan and reviewed for sufficiency of operation and impacts to the
surrounding roadway system.
e. Posted speed on all existing roads that may be significantly impacted by the development.
f. Distances from existing streets, driveways, and/or median cuts to development access.
g. Alignment with existing streets, driveways, and/or median cuts to development access.
h. Intersection layout, lane usage and roadway configuration.
i. Traffic control devices such as traffic signals or stop signs.
j. Traffic signal timing and phasing  Offset times should be shown if any coordination with adjacent signals is
being used.
k. Right of way width(s) all existing roads that may be significantly impacted by the development.
l. Lane width(s) for all lanes
m. Daily and peak-hour traffic counts should be collected for use in the traffic impact study. At a minimum a 24-
hour count should be taken on a typical Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday for all roadways in the study area.
However, the type of development or local conditions may require counts be taken on weekends. Peak-hour
intersection turning movement counts (15 min. increment) at key intersections should also be taken. As with
the daily counts, peak-hour counts may vary. Traffic counts used in a study should be less than one year old.
The City reserves the right to request more counts if they are deemed necessary based on specific conditions.
The existing counts should be presented in a diagram form for each intersection counted.
n. Pedestrian facilities and volumes (If appropriate)
o. Level of service of roadway sections and intersections - The latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) or approved traffic analysis software (SYNCHRO) may be used. Prior approval of alternate software
may be requested from the City Engineer during the preliminary study meeting.
p. Photographs may be used to document existing conditions of the site.
3. Projected Traffic
a. The calculation of the project traffic shall be shown in sufficient detail so that all calculations can be verified.
In addition, descriptions of the following items shall be included in the report.

used to estimate site trip distribution. Trip Distribution and Assignment can be accomplished either
manually or with applicable computer models. A figure showing the trip distribution is required.
c. Background Traffic (Daily, a.m. and p.m. peak) - This shall account for all approved developments in the study
area as well as area growth beyond study area. Typically this is determined through analysis of historical
trends in the region. This should be discussed at the preliminary study meeting. If necessary, this peak-hour
data shall also be shown in a figure similar to that for the existing traffic.
d. Reassignment rates for pass-by and diverted trips - A procedure for calculating pass-by trips is described in
Chapter 5 of the ITE Trip Generation Handbook based on different land use classifications. The table below
shows values to be used for the most typical land use. Reduction for any other land use types must be
thoroughly documented and approved by the City Engineer. Internal capture can be accounted for using the
procedures described in Chapter 7 of the ITE Traffic Engineering Handbook.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 79
e. Total Traffic shall be shown combining project and background traffic and shown in figure form for each
intersection.
f. Future Traffic (if required) shall also be calculated and shown in similar figure format.
Pass-By Trip Reduction For Typical Land Uses
Land Use Acceptable Trip Reduction

prior approval of alternate software may be requested from the City Engineer.
iv. Un-signalized intersections and traffic signal warrant analysis if applicable. A capacity analysis using
projected traffic volumes must be conducted using the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM). If signalization is warranted by the traffic signal warrants outlined in the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), conduct a complete warrant analysis and analyze the intersection(s) as
signalized intersection(s).
v. Roadway network - Impacts to LOS on key mainline roadway links should be determined.
vi. Turning vehicle storage space needed or the adequacy of storage space for turning vehicles at study
intersections should also be analyzed. This analysis should consider signal phasing and overall signal cycle
length, as well as vehicle volumes. Analysis of queuing may be required.

9.7 TECHNICAL NOTES
Trip Generation: Average trip generation rates or regression equations for the peak hour of the adjacent street will be
obtained from the current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual. Other local data
may be acceptable provided it was collected using recommended methodology and can be properly document.
Peak Hour Percent: A peak hour percentage of 10 percent of the daily trips will be assumed for existing traffic unless
hourly counts are available.
Peak Hour: Generally, the petitioner shall use the peak one hour period which occurs during either 7-9 A.M. or 4-6 P.M.
periods or both, as agreed to by the staff and petitioner. In some cases, however, the City Engineer may require
additional hours, for example, Friday nights or Saturday afternoon, to also be analyzed.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 81
Directional Split: The directional split of the entering and exiting traffic associated with the development will be derived
from the ITE Trip Generation manual unless other acceptable locally generated data is available.
Pass-by Trips: The percent of pass-by trips shall be applied to the trips generated by the proposed development and
assigned to the adjacent street network. This rate does not affect the proposed projects driveway volumes but rather
reassigns existing trips to movements entering and existing the proposed development. The following pass-by trip rates
have been determined for some land uses:
Land Use Acceptable Trip Reduction
Retail > 400,000 GLA 20 %
Retail 100,000-400,000 GLA 25 %
Retail <100,000 GLA 35 %
Quality / Sit-down Restaurants 15 %
Fast-food Restaurants 35 %
Convenience/Gas Stations 40 %
Banks 15 %
Supermarket 20 %
Discount Club/Warehouse Store 20 %
Diverted Linked Trips: A reassignment for diverted trips will generally occur outside the impacted study area; therefore,
for the purpose of these traffic impact studies, diverted trips would be considered new trips within the study area and
can be ignored in most cases. This factor, if applicable, will be decided during the preliminary meeting.
Internal Circulation Trips: Reductions for internal circulation trips are applicable for projects such as shopping centers
with out-lots and represents a reduction in projected driveway trips. The internal circulation trip rate will be agreed
upon during the preliminary meeting and shall not exceed 10 percent.
Trip Distribution: The directional distribution of the generated trips entering and exiting the proposed development via
all access points must be justified by the relative locations of other traffic generators (e.g., employment centers,
transportation terminals, etc.) and/or trip table information. These factors, or other factors agreed upon by the
Department of Public Works, shall be applied to the traffic generated by the proposed development as well as the traffic
generated by nearby approved projects.
Trip Assignment: The distribution factors shall be applied to the trips generated by the proposed development and
nearby approved projects and assigned to the existing traffic on the road network providing access to the proposed
development.
Capacity Analysis: At the identified critical intersection(s), the existing and generated traffic is to be related to the
adequacy of the intersection by using the techniques described in the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual or
utilizing SYNCHRO modeling software. The analysis should be carried out for the A.M. and/or P.M. peaks, as agreed to by
the staff and applicant. It is also recommended that the operational methodology be used in the analysis of signalized
intersections
Traffic Data:
A. Traffic volume data may be available from the Department of Public Works for some locations within the City. If,
however, acceptable data is not available, the petitioner is responsible for obtaining all required data.
B. Traffic count data should be no older than one year or the city may require new counts be collected. If, in the
opinion of the Department of Public Works staff, traffic volumes have significantly increased due to some change(s)
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 82
in the traffic pattern, such as the completion of a development project after the count was made new counts may
also be required.
C. If turning movement data is outdated or if there are locations for which data is non-existent, data must be acquired
at the applicants expense.
D. Intersection traffic counts conducted by the petitioner should be comprised of manual turning movement counts
covering the peak A.M. and P.M. periods in order to allow for the selection of the peak hour within the next fifteen
minutes (e.g., 4:00-5:00, 4:15-5:15, etc.) The inclusion of all A.M. and P.M. peak period turning movement data is
requested as part of the traffic impact analysis.
E. Ideally the traffic analysis should be performed for the design hour which represents the 30th highest hourly traffic
volume on an annual basis. However, most peak hour traffic volume counts in urban areas closely approximate the
30th highest hour. Historical counts and staff knowledge of the area will be used to judge the adequacy of counts
used by the applicant.
F. If the proposed development includes plans for the installation of a new traffic control signal, the petitioner must
conduct a Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis. This analysis would produce documentation that indicates the conditions
at the proposed location warrant a traffic signal by meeting the recommended minimum warrants presented in the
Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices, (MUTCD). Documentation of this analysis should be included in the
appendix of the final report and should include, but not be limited to, the methodology used, daily traffic count data
used in the analysis, and the resulting capacity analysis results at this location.
Adequate Accommodation of Traffic: The ability of a highway system to carry traffic is expressed in terms of volume-tocapacity
(V/C) ratios and level of service at the critical locations, usually intersections. The V/C ratios clearly define the
degree of saturation at an intersection. A V/C ratio of 1.0 indicates that the intersection is operating at its theoretical
capacity, that is, the traffic volume demand equals the estimated number of vehicles that may pass through the
intersection in a given period of time. A value of over 1.0 depicts a situation where the demand exceeds the
intersections capacity and operational problems exist, either in geometrics or signalization. As the V/C ratio approaches
0.9, breakdowns in the operational efficiency of the intersection tend to develop. When the V/C increases above 0.9,
operational breakdowns also increase in frequency and may result in a high level of delay to motorists.
In considering mitigation measures, the change in V/C ratio and level of service must be taken into account as well as
the actual V/C values of individual approaches and the overall intersection. If no mitigation exists or if the improvements
required are beyond what could reasonably be expected from the applicant, then negotiations between the petitioner
and the City will be conducted to determine the level of petitioner responsibility for improvements at the intersection.
Level-of-service for signalized intersections is defined by the Transportation Research Boards Highway Capacity Manual,
in terms of delay. Generally, delay is considered a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, lost time and fuel
consumption. Delay at signalized intersections is a result of a number of factors, including the signals cycle length,
phasing, progression in relation to other signals, traffic volumes and the intersections lane configuration and
geometrics.

lane, local access roadways located in residential zoning classification R. Asphalt streets shall be constructed in
accordance with the City of Richmond Standard Construction Details.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 95
B. Roadway Classifications - The City of Richmond recognizes four basic classifications of public roadways that include
major thoroughfares, major collectors, minor collectors and local streets. Each class provides a certain degree of
continuity, capacity, and accessibility to adjacent land uses. While differentiated by function, there is also a variance
in geometric design. Table 11.1 summarizes the general design criteria of roadways within Richmond. The typical
cross-sections are depicted in Figures 11.1 and 11.2.
C. Roadway Geometrics - Geometrics of city streets may be defined as the geometry of the pavement and curb areas
that govern the movement of traffic within the confines of the rights-of-way (ROW). Included in the geometrics are
pavement width, degree of curvature, width of traffic lanes, median nose radii, curb radii at street intersections,
cross fall, crown height, pavement thickness and geometric shapes of islands separating traffic movements and
other features.
D. Design Speed - The design speed is a primary factor in the horizontal and vertical alignment of roadways. Design
features such as curvature, super-elevation, turning movement radii and sight distance affects roadway lane width,
pavement width, pavement cross-slope, pavement crown and clearances. Designs speeds above those shown in
Table 11.1 may be required if the nature of the roadway justifies a higher design speed. Refer to Table 11.1.
E. Grades - Roadway grades shall be a minimum of three-tenths percent (0.3%) in order to insure proper flow of
surface drainage toward inlets and a maximum of six percent (6%). Steeper grades may be permitted on local
residential streets and where required by topographical features, as approved by the City Engineer.
F. Roadway Centerline - Roadways shall be placed in the center of the ROW, but may be shifted slightly, with prior City
approval, to avoid groupings of trees. The centerline of curves shall be tangent to the centerline of street at each
end of curve.
G. Cross Slope/Crown Height  Thoroughfares shall have a minimum cross slope of one-quarter inch per foot and a
maximum cross slope of three-eighths inch per foot. Major and minor collectors and local streets shall have six-inch
(6) crowns.
H. Pavement Strength & Thickness - All concrete pavement and curbs shall be a minimum 3,500-psi and shall meet the
structural requirements of Section 11.12 & 13 and Table 11.1.
I. Sight Distance - All intersections on major thoroughfares and major collectors and intersections of other streets with
adjacent community fencing, monument signs or hardscaping, horizontal curves and vertical curves shall be
evaluated for adequate sight distances in accordance with AASHTO guidelines. Sight distance triangles shall be
shown on the plan view of construction plans.
J. Channelization - Channelization shall conform to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
"A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets", latest edition.
K. Private Streets  Private streets are streets that are not owned by the City of Richmond, the State of Texas or the
County and are not dedicated for public use. All private streets shall be constructed to the same standards as public
streets.
L. Rural Estate Subdivisions  Rural estate subdivisions are subdivisions that typically do not have amenities such as
sidewalks, streetlights and enclosed storm sewers. Paving construction and intersection layout and geometrics shall
conform to the requirements of this manual and the City of Richmond Standard Construction Detail.
M. Requirements for Thoroughfares.
1. The full right-of-way for major thoroughfares adjacent to planned developments shall be dedicated at the time
of platting of the development.
2. When the full section of a thoroughfare is located within the city limits and is dedicated on a final plat, the
esplanade and all lanes of the thoroughfare shall be constructed at the time of development of the adjacent
subdivision.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 96
3. If approved by the City Engineer, one-half of the major thoroughfare, including travel lanes, left-turn lanes and
the esplanade to the centerline of the right-of-way shall be constructed at the time of initial construction of the
adjacent development. The remainder of the thoroughfare shall be constructed at the time the property
adjacent to the unconstructed half is developed.
4. Permanent barricades, conforming to the requirements of the Texas Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices,
shall be constructed at the termination of lanes on partially constructed thoroughfares. The barricades shall
include a sign reading FUTURE ROADWAY EXTENSION mounted on a breakaway pole and located one foot
behind the barricade, with the bottom of the sign one foot above the top of the barricade.
N. Standard City barricades shall be placed at the end of dead-end streets not terminating in a cul-de-sac.
O. At a T-intersection with a street that has not been improved to its ultimate width, the concrete pavement of the
intersecting street shall be stopped either at the right-of-way line or the end of the curb return, whichever would
require less concrete removal at a future date.
P. For roadway turnouts placed at an existing cross street intersection, the turnout should be designed to fit the
ultimate pavement width of the intersecting cross street and then transitioned to the existing roadway.
Q. Residential driveways shall not access major thoroughfares or collector streets without written approval from the
Director of Public Works. Subdivision layouts shall be designed to avoid homes requiring collector street access.
R. Table 11.1 and Figure 11.1 are intended to represent typical situations and conditions.
Typical cross-sections may be deviated from with approval of the Director of Public Works.
S. Minimum allowable roadway tapers shall be as shown in Figure 11.20.

11.3. HORIZONTAL CURVATURE
A. Horizontal curvature is defined as the centerline radius of the street right-of-way.
B. Minimum Horizontal Design Radius:
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 100
The minimum centerline radius is a function of design speed, super-elevation and vehicle side friction. Side friction is
the force that keeps a vehicle from sliding off of the roadway. The minimum acceptable horizontal centerline radius
is calculated using the following equation:
Where:
R = centerline radius (ft); V = vehicle design speed (MPH); e = rate of roadway super-elevation, (ft/ft); f = side friction
factor.
C. Major thoroughfare, collector and local street horizontal curves shall be designed without super-elevation unless
approved by the City Engineer.
D. The minimum acceptable horizontal, with super-elevation, radius is shown in Table 11.2. The maximum length of a
horizontal curve on collector or local roadways shall not exceed 1.6 times the centerline radius for a radius of two
hundred feet (200) or greater.

1. May be reduced to three hundred feet (300) radius at mid-block locations provided that it is shown that the general public safety is not compromised. A
curve, with a radius less than four hundred fifty feet (450), must be a minimum of three hundred feet (300) from a street or alley intersection.
E. Major thoroughfares with a centerline radius of the right-of-way less than two thousand feet (2,000') require specific
approval by the City Engineer and shall be designed considering recommendations for super-elevation in accordance
with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, "A Policy on Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets", latest edition. Signage and design speed shall be considered for all curved thoroughfares. A
maximum rate of super-elevation should be 0.02 for urban conditions.
F. The minimum curvature for a local street less than two thousand feet (2,000') long may be reduced from four
hundred fifty feet (450) to three hundred feet (300') at mid-block locations or in cul-de-sacs less than 2,000 feet
long, provided that it is shown that the general public safety is not compromised. A curve, with a radius less than
four hundred fifty feet (450), must be a minimum of three hundred feet (300) from a street or alley intersection
and shall be signed with an advisory speed limit and appropriate warning signs.
G. The minimum curvature for a local street two thousand feet (2,000') long or longer shall be four hundred and fifty
feet (450'). Lengths shall be measured along the centerline of the road right-of-way between the centerline of the
collector or thoroughfare pavement, the center of the right angle intersection, and/or the center of the cul-de-sac.
H. Tangent length is defined as the distance between the point of tangency and the point of curvature of two adjacent
curves along the centerline of the street right-of-way. The minimum tangent length between reverse curves shall be
one hundred feet (100'), except along local streets.
I. Horizontal curves, and street alignment in general, shall be evaluated for adequate clearances from obstructions.
Such obstructions could include retaining walls, abutments or bridge columns, signposts, large trees, or head walls.
Appropriate measures shall be taken to eliminate and/or mitigate hazards posed by obstructions.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 101
J. A minimum of 50 radius turn is allowed on local streets with a knuckle design and in accordance with the Richmond
Standard Details.
11.4 VERTICAL CURVATURE
A. Vertical curves shall be designed when algebraic difference in grades exceeds one and two tenths percent (1.2%).
Elevations shall be shown on the construction plans at ten-foot (10') intervals through vertical curves. The gradient
for tangents to vertical curves at railroad crossings shall be a maximum of three and one-half percent (3.5%). All
crest vertical curves shall be determined by sight distance requirements for the design speed. The minimum design
speed on any vertical curve shall be based on the street classification.
B. Minimum Vertical Alignment:
Vertical curves are utilized in roadway design to affect gradual change between tangent grades and will result in
design that is safe, comfortable in operation, pleasing in appearance and adequate for drainage. Vertical curve
alignment shall also provide Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) in all cases. SSD is a function of design speed, perceptionreaction
time, grade, and dynamic friction. The perception-reaction time is assumed to be 2.5 seconds as stated by
American Association of Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The dynamic friction is the force that resists
movement of the vehicle while the tires are in a locked position. The equation for SSD appears below:
Where:
SSD = Stopping Sight Distance (ft); P = perception Reaction Time (2.5 sec.); V = vehicle design speed (MPH); f =
coefficient of friction between tires and roadway; g = percent grade divided by 100
C. To determine the minimum acceptable length of Crest and Sag curves shown in Tables 11.3 and 11.4, it is assumed
that g=0 in the SSD calculation. Tables 11.3 and 11.4 also show values of K. K is defined as the rate of vertical
curvature and is equivalent to the horizontal distance in feet required to make a one percent (1%) change in grade.
The values of A are equivalent to the algebraic difference in grade between the two grades that are being joined
together by the vertical curve.

11.10 SIDEWALK AND TRAIL DESIGN
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 113
A. Definition of Sidewalk - A sidewalk is defined as that paved area in a street ROW or adjacent easement that is
between the curb lines or the edge of pavement of the roadway and the adjacent property or easement lines that is
designed for the use of pedestrians. The maximum grade of the sidewalk shall be one-half-inch (1/2") per foot. The
maximum cross-fall of the sidewalk shall be one-quarter-inch (1/4") per foot. Sidewalks shall conform to the latest
ADA and TDLR requirements and to the following standards.
B. Residential Areas (Single Family and Duplex) - A concrete sidewalk, five feet (5) in width, shall be located within the
street ROW, not more than two feet (2) feet from the ROW line unless pre-existing physical encroachments (e.g.,
utility infrastructure or trees) dictate otherwise. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all streets. Sidewalks
and parkways (curb to ROW) shall be graded at one-quarter-inch (1/4) per foot above the top of the street curb.
Construction of a sidewalk along a single-family residential local street may be deferred until a lot is improved,
provided there is a note regarding sidewalk construction on the subdivision plat. The homebuilder shall construct
sidewalks for residential lots.
C. Non-Residential Areas and Apartment Complexes - A concrete sidewalk, five feet (5) in width, shall be located in
street ROW not more than two feet (2) from the ROW line. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all
streets. If other materials are placed in the ROW between the sidewalk and curb, the material shall meet City
specifications and be of a color and texture distinctly different from the sidewalk and specified on the site plan.
D. Meandering Sidewalks - Sidewalk easements adjacent to the standard ROW will be required, if necessary, for
meandering sidewalks. If landscape reserves of sufficient width are platted adjacent to the right-of-way and include
public walks as an allowable use on the plat, additional sidewalk easements are not required. The near edge of the
sidewalk closest to the street shall be located not less than two feet (2) from the back-of-curb and shall meander
into the sidewalk easement. Sidewalk easements shall provide a minimum clearance of two feet (2) beyond the rear
edge of the sidewalk.
E. Exceptions - If it should be necessary to construct the walk immediately adjacent to the street curb line, the walk
shall be a minimum of six feet (6) in width. At no time shall the near side of the walk away from the street be less
than five feet (5) away from the back of curb. If the required sidewalk is to be placed outside of the street ROW, it
must be placed in a sidewalk easement. Approval of planned exceptions and sidewalk easements shall be made at
the time of site plan or plat approval.
F. Areas with Screening Walls or Community Fencing - In areas where a screening wall is provided, a meandering
sidewalk shall be provided and shall not encroach any closer than two feet (2) from the wall.
G. Sidewalks on Bridges - All street bridges on major thoroughfares and major collectors shall have a sidewalk
constructed on each side of the bridge. Pedestrian access/routing shall be provided on all bridges on all streets. The
sidewalk shall be a minimum of six feet (6) wide with a parapet wall or traffic rail provided a minimum of two feet
(2) behind the back of curb of the roadway. A standard pedestrian bridge rail protecting the sidewalk shall be
provided on the outside edge of the bridge. See Figure 11.13.

11.11 PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY VISIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
A. Adequate sight distance at the intersection of all streets shall be assured. This sight distance is provided through the
use of a Corner Visibility Triangle and/or a Sight Line Triangle. Construction plans for roadways shall show both the
Corner Visibility Triangle and the Sight Line Triangle on the plan view of proposed streets. Corner Visibility Triangles
shall be dedicated as ROW and Sight Line Triangles shall be identified and dedicated as Visibility, Access and
Maintenance Easements or Reserves (VAMs). In addition, a Sight Line Triangle must also be provided for the
following cases:
1. Where a driveway, alley, or any roadway that is controlled by a stop sign intersects with an uncontrolled
thoroughfare.
2. On any signalized intersection approach where right-turn on red operation is permitted, a sight line triangle must
be provided for the right turn driver.
B. Corner Visibility Triangle Defined:
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 115
1. The corner visibility triangle is defined at an intersection by extending the two ROW lines from their point of
intersection to a distance as shown on Table 11.8. These two points are then connected with an imaginary line to
form the corner visibility triangle as shown in Figure 11.14. If there are no curbs existing, then the triangular area
shall be formed by extending the property lines for a distance of thirty feet (30) from their point of intersection.

2. Where alleys intersect public streets, the corner visibility triangle is measured as fifteen feet (15) along the
residential street ROW and five feet (5) along the alley ROW from the point of intersection. These two points are
then connected with an imaginary line to form the corner visibility triangle as shown in Figure 11.15. The alley
corner visibility triangle shall be dedicated as ROW.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 116
FIGURE 11.15: Corner Visibility Triangle for an Alley
C. Sight Line Triangle Defined:
1. The sight line triangle is formed by first extending a line along the center line of the proposed roadway or
driveway that begins at the tangent curb of the intersecting roadway and extends to its endpoint fifteen feet
(15) into the proposed thoroughfare or driveway. For the sight line triangle to the left, construct a second
imaginary line that is parallel to and five feet (5) out from the intersecting thoroughfares curb that begins at the
centerline of the side street and continues to the left for a distance L to its endpoint. To complete the sight line
triangle, connect the endpoints of the first two lines as shown in Figures 11.16 and 11.17. In the case of the sight
line triangle to the right, the second imaginary line is parallel and five feet (5) out from the nearest edge of the
conflicting traffic flow (or adjacent median in the event of a divided roadway). It begins at the centerline of the
side street and continues to the right for a distance R to its endpoint (See Figures 11.16 and 11.17). On divided
roadways with a median width greater than 30 feet, sight line triangles shall be generated at the intersecting
roadway and at the median opening.

11.17 TRAFFIC CALMING GUIDELINES
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 122
A. Introduction:
1. Traffic Calming, a concept that dates back to the 1960s and 70s, has been implemented more extensively
throughout the United States during the 1990s. The primary purpose of traffic calming is to decrease speeds and
reduce cut-through traffic volumes. The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) defines traffic calming as:
Traffic Calming is the combination of mainly physical measures that reduce the negative effects of motor vehicle
use, alter driver behavior and improve conditions for non-motorized street users.
2. Urban sprawl and traffic congestion continue to increase in the United States. As a result, speeds and cutthrough
volumes on local streets and collectors will continue to increase unless traffic calming measures are put
in place or new local and minor collector roadways are designed with traffic calming in mind.
3. The Design Manual and UDC are intended to provide design and access requirements that are proactive in
addressing traffic calming issues in residential areas.
4. Traffic control devices such as STOP Signs and speed limit signs are regulatory measures that require
enforcement. Traffic calming measures, however, are intended to be self-enforcing.
B. The City of Richmond encourages the implementation of traffic calming philosophy in the design and retrofitting of
subdivisions. The Institute of Transportation Engineers Guidelines on Traffic Calming and the Texas Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices shall be considered in the design of new subdivisions. The City may require traffic

16.1 CROSSINGS
A. Highway and Street Crossings
1. State Highway crossings shall be constructed in conformance with the requirements of the Texas Department of
Transportation and a TxDOT permit to perform work in its ROW is required. County road crossings shall be
constructed in accordance with the requirements of Fort Bend. These permits shall be submitted with the Major
Construction Improvement permit application to the Department of Public Works.
2. Where additional right-of-way has been acquired or will be required for future widening, the casing, where
required, should be carried to within ten feet (10') of each future right-of-way line.
3. Conduits and sewers that do not carry liquid under pressure may be bored and jacked into place without an
encasement pipe.
4. Crossings under existing concrete streets, other than major thoroughfares, shall be constructed by boring and
jacking. P.V.C. pipe shall be jacked into place using equipment designed for that purpose. Water may be used to
facilitate the boring and jacking operations. Jetting the pipe main into the place will not be permitted. When
conditions exist that warrant open cut across an existing street, the Department of Public Works shall specifically
approve the crossing. The City Engineer will be the deciding authority on whether an open cut is warranted and
the limits of pavement removal and replacement that is necessary.
5. All open cut installations under existing or proposed streets shall be backfilled with cement stabilized sand in
accordance with the City of Richmond Construction Details unless specifically exempted by the City Engineer.
City of Richmond, TX | Unified Development Ordinance 183
6. All street crossings shall be constructed in accordance with construction plans approved by the City. All street
crossings shall be inspected by the Department of Public Works. All street crossings shall meet the requirements
of these Standards.
B. Railroad and Pipeline Crossings
1. For railroad crossings, the carrier pipe shall be encased in steel pipe casing extending from right-of-way to rightof-
way.
2. All construction within the railroad or pipeline right-of-way shall conform to minimum requirements set out in
the agreement with the owner of the right-of-way.
3. Copies of the permits and /or agreements from the railroad or pipeline shall be provided with the Major
Construction Improvement permit application to the Department of Public Works.
C. Ditch and Stream Crossings
1. Crossing under a stream or ditch rather than an aerial crossing is required unless specifically approved by the City
Engineer. The top of the carrier pipe shall be designed to provide a minimum clearance of at least four feet (4')
below the ultimate flow line and sides of the ditch and with sufficient bottom length to exceed the ultimate
future ditch sections.
