PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Harlingen, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1997 Code, as supplemented through September 3, 2014, and ordinances adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1997 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the or indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Amanda C. Elizondo, City Secretary, and Mr. Richard L. Bilbie, City Attorney, for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

ARTICLE VIII. - PERMANENT PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS AND PARKS 

Sec. 1. - Street, sidewalk and alley improving and assessing. 
    The City shall have dominion, control and jurisdiction in, on, over and under its public streets, squares, avenues, alleys and highways, and to provide for the improvement of these, upon the initiative of the City Commission, or upon petition of property owners, as provided by paving, repaving, raising, grading, and draining openings, widening, narrowing or straightening, and by construction of sidewalks, and curbs or culverts, or other public improvements. The word "highway," as used here, shall include all streets, alleys, sidewalks, public places, avenues and squares in the City. The City shall have the power to assess the whole cost of sidewalks and curbs and not more than three-fourths of the cost of other street improvement work, except the cost to be paid owners of railroads and street railroads, against the owners of property abutting the highway or section thereof improved, and against the property, and to fix a lien against the property which shall be superior to all other liens and claims, except City, State and County and other taxes, and a charge of personal liability against owners of the property. The portion of the cost assessed against the owners of abutting property may be made payable in deferred installments, the last due not more than five (5) years from the completion of the improvements and with interest at a rate not exceeding eight (8) percent per annum. The assessments may include reasonable attorney's fees and cost of collection, if incurred, and the City Commission shall have power to fix the terms of payment, maturity and conditions of the assessments and of the assignable certificates provided for here. 
    The entire cost of making such improvements between or under the rails, tracks and switches or railroads or street railroads, occupying any highway or intersection improved, and for two (2) feet on the outside of said tracks, shall be paid by the owners, and secured by a lien assessed on the road beds, ties, tracks, franchise and other property of the owners, which lien shall be superior to all other liens, claims or interests in or upon the property, except City, State, and County or other taxes. The ordinance making the assessment shall provide the time and terms of payment and for the payment of interest, costs and attorney's fees as set out above. 
    No assessments shall be made against owners of abutting property or against railroads, or street railroads, or their property, until after a hearing for the owners, and lien holders or other interested parties, before the City Commission, with reasonable advance notice which shall consist of a general notice published at least three (3) times prior to the hearing in some newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Harlingen, the first publication to be at least ten (10) days before the date of hearing. The City Commission shall have authority to give other additional notice, but the published notice shall be sufficient and binding upon lien holders and other interested parties and owners. 
    At the hearing, owners and other interested parties shall have the right to contest the assessments, the legality or regularity of any proceeding with regard to the assessment, or the special benefits arising from the improvements. 
    No assessment shall be made against any owner of abutting property or his property in excess of special benefits thereto in enhanced value arising from the improvements. 
    All protests, contests and objections at the hearing shall be in writing, and the City Commission shall have power to hear evidence, summon witnesses and take testimony with reference to the matter at issue. 
    The assessments may be enforced, either by suit in any court having jurisdiction, brought by the City for the benefit of the holder and owner of the assessments or the certificates, or brought by the owner and holder, or by sale of the property assessed in the same manner, or as near as possible, as is prescribed for sale of real estate for municipal taxes. 
    The lien of the assessments herein mentioned shall relate back and take effect on all subsequent purchasers and creditors from the date of the ordinance or resolution ordering the improvement. 
    Subsection 1. The City Commission shall have power to cause to be issued, in the name and on behalf of the City, assignable certificates in writing, declaring the liability of owners and their property for the payment of assessments and to fix the terms and conditions of the certificates. If any of these certificates shall recite that the proceedings with reference to making such improvements have been in compliance with law, and that prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property, and the personal liability of the owner, have been performed, such recitals shall be prima facie evidence of the facts, and no further proof shall be required in any court. 
    Subsection 2. Nothing contained here shall empower the City to fix a lien by assessment against any property exempt by law from sale under execution, but the owner of the exempt property shall nevertheless be personally liable for the pro rata portion of laid cost which would be assessed against the property were it not exempt, and this cost shall be assessed against the owner. 
The fact that any improvement is omitted in front of an exempt property shall not invalidate the lien of assessment made against other property. 
    Subsection 3. In apportioning costs of improvements among owners of the abutting property, the City Commission shall act in accordance with the front foot rule, in proportion as the front feet of property of each owner abutting the highway to be improved is to the whole frontage. But if in particular cases the application of this rule would be unequal or unjust, the City Commission shall adopt a rule that shall effect substantial justice and equality, in view of special benefits received and burdens imposed. 
    Subsection 4. No error, mistake or informality in the ordinance of assessment or in any other step or proceeding prerequisite to the assessment shall invalidate it, but the City Commission shall at any time correct the error. 
No error or mistake in describing any parcel of abutting property or the name of its owner shall invalidate an assessment, but it shall still have full force and be in effect against the premises and the real and true owner of the property. 
Whenever, in the opinion of the City Commission, any error, mistake or invalidity exists in any proceeding with reference to improvements or assessments, it shall correct the error, mistake or invalidity and reassess said the correct property and the owners. Reassessments shall be made after a notice and hearing as provided here, and not in excess of benefits in enhanced value of the property assessed, and otherwise as near as possible in accordance with the provisions here with reference to original assessments. After a reassessment, the City shall have power to issue assignable certificates as evidence of the procedure which may be payable in deferred installments, the last maturing not over five (5) years from date of the reassessment, and the terms and conditions of the certificates shall as near as possible comply with the preceding provisions having reference to assignable certificates. 
No reassessments shall be made unless proceedings for it are begun within three (3) years from the date of the original assessments, provided that if the validity of any assessment shall be involved in litigation, the period of time consumed with that shall not be considered in computing the three (3) years. 
The City Commission shall have power to adopt rules, regulations, and ordinances consistent with this Charter for the purpose of carrying into effect every part of this section and its subsections, and to effect the assessments and reassessments. 
    Subsection 5. Whenever the owners of more than fifty (50) percent of the front feet of property abutting any highway or highway section which they desire improved, shall petition the City Commission in writing (which may be one or more separate petitions) and shall state the limits within which the work is to be done, the general description of it and the materials and methods or alternate materials and method with which it is desired the improvements shall be made. The signers of the petition shall agree in it to pay the several amounts which may be assessed against them respectively under the terms of the agreement, the petition shall be filed with the City Commission, and shall be examined by it and in its discretion approved or disapproved by resolution. 
The approval of such petition by the City Commission shall be conclusive of its regularity and validity, and, if approved, the City Commission shall order the work done as nearly as possible with the materials and in accordance with the methods, or, if alternative materials or methods shall be set out in the petition, in accordance with some method and with some material or materials specified in it. 
When the procedure is under this subsection, the City Commission shall make the improvements and assess and apportion the cost for them, after notice and hearing as provided for here, and shall take all steps and do all things in strict accordance with the provisions of this section. Provided that when the work is done pursuant to petition, the City shall pay the whole cost of improvement of intersections of other streets and alleys with the highways named to be improved, except the portion assessable against railroads and street railroads occupying the highway and intersection; the railroads and street railroads shall pay the whole cost of the improvements of the highway or portion that is between and under their rails and tracks and two (2) feet on the outside, which cost shall be assessed against owners and their property, and collected in the manner provided in this article. The owners of property abutting the highway or section to be improved shall pay the whole remaining cost of the improvements, and it shall be apportioned among them and assessed against them, and their property in the manner provided in this article. 
    Subsection 6. In any suit brought for the enforcement of an assessment, reassessment or personal liability, the allegation in the petition or other pleading that all proceedings with reference to making such improvements have been in compliance with the law and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien upon the property assessed and the personal liability of the owner, or the insurance of the assignable certificates have been performed, shall be deemed a sufficient allegation of every proceeding required by law, the City Charter, or its ordinances with reference to such improvements or prerequisites to the fixing of the lien or liability and insurance of the certificates, and shall dispense with the necessity of pleading each of the preceding steps or prerequisites specifically, and shall in all courts be taken as if each of the steps, proceedings, or prerequisites had been alleged and set out in full. 
Any property owner against whom or whose property an assessment or reassessment has been made shall have the right within twenty (20) days of the assessment to bring suit in any court having jurisdiction to set aside or correct the action or any proceeding related to it, on account of any error or invalidity occurring. But after that an owner, his heirs, assigns or successors shall be barred from any such action or any defense of invalidity in the proceedings or assessments in any action in which the action may be brought in question. 
    Subsection 7. All contracts for street improvements entered into by the City and not fully performed and all proceedings on the street improvements are hereby ratified, confirmed and validated, and all powers enjoyed by the City that it was empowered to provide for the execution of the contracts, and for the assessment of any portion of the cost of the improvements against owners of property abutting them, and their property, or against the owners of railroads and street railroads and their property, and also all powers of the City for the enforcement of the assessments and collections of them, are extended here and preserved in full force for the purpose of making the assessments and enforcing said existing contracts, and it shall be the duty of the City Commission to pass all ordinances and resolutions and take all steps necessary or proper to fully execute the contracts or validate or ratify them and to make and enforce the assessments. 
    Subsection 8. The City Commission, in carrying out and exercising the powers granted by this section and its subsections, may proceed by resolution, except that no assessment or reassessment shall be finally levied other than by ordinance. 
All the powers granted by this section and its subsections, when adopted, shall be applicable to the enforcement of the existing contracts and to the making and enforcement of the assessments there to be made against owners of abutting property, and their property, and against the owners of railroads and street railroads and their property, and to the issuance of assignable certificates as provided here; and the City Commission shall fully exercise the powers to make and enforce the assessments, and to issue the certificates, under and in accordance with terms of this section and its subsections, when adopted.

g.  List items from the commission in a separate section of the agenda and identify which members of the commission requested the items inclusion;

Establish a deadline to receive all agenda items prior to each regularly scheduled city commission meeting, with the understanding that items submitted after that time will be held over until the next commission meeting, unless the item is of such importance that the mayor or city manager elects to place it on an earlier agenda or calls a special meeting; 
b.  Prepare the agenda for proper and legal posting to the public and make the agenda available to the media so that the media will have enough notice of the agenda and the date, time, and place of the meeting to disseminate the notice of the commission meeting to the public at least the day before the scheduled meeting.

f.  Notify each individual who has placed an item on the agenda of the fact that they are expected to be at the meeting to discuss their item, but the city secretary shall only be required to provide each individual with notice that the item is on the agenda and the number of the item as shown on the agenda and shall not have to give a time for that person to be ready to appear before the commission. 
(5)  The city commission shall: 
a.  Except as otherwise provided in Texas Government Code § 551.045, not consider or take action on any item unless that item has been posted on the agenda for a specific meeting and the agenda has been posted in a public place 72 hours prior to the meeting; and 
b.  Not take an item up for discussion as a matter of commission business during any commission meeting that does not appear on the agenda; however, the commission may receive information through the citizen's communications process. 
(b)  Except as otherwise provided by state law, this section shall be directory only and a violation of any of the provisions of this section does not affect the validity or legality of any commission action otherwise properly adopted. Each newly elected commission may adopt new procedural rules. If procedural rules are adopted under this section, the city secretary shall make copies of the rules available to the public.

Sec. 2-316. - Standards of conduct. 
    In order to more fully establish and implement the policy in this article, to ensure that all city officials act and conduct themselves both inside and outside the city's service so as to give no occasion for distrust of their integrity, and to avoid even the appearance of impropriety by any city official, the following standards of conduct are adopted: 
(1)  Prohibition against granting special consideration. No city official shall grant any special consideration, treatment, or advantage to any citizen, individual, business organization, or group beyond that which is normally available to every other citizen, individual, business organization, or group. This shall not prevent special considerations authorized and granted by the city commission, the Development Corporation of Harlingen, Inc., the public improvement district (PID), and other city boards, commissions and committees for the purpose of creating incentives necessary to secure or retain employees or to support and enhance economic development in compliance with the Texas Constitution and state law. 
(2)  Prohibition against appearances on behalf of private interests. 
a.  No city official shall represent or appear on behalf of private interests of others before any agency or department of the city, or any city municipal court, board, commission, committee, or city commission concerning any civil or criminal case, administrative hearing, disciplinary action, project, proposal, or matter over which the city official exercises any discretionary authority, either directly or indirectly, nor shall a city official represent any private interest of others in any action or proceeding, civil or criminal, involving the city or any of its employees appearing in an official capacity or as a witness, nor voluntarily participate on behalf of others in any litigation to which the city is a party or any of its employees appearing in an official capacity or as a witness, unless authorized by the city. For example, a city official who is an attorney is prohibited from representing any person in litigation in which a city police officer is, or may be, a witness in his official capacity. 
b.  Provided that a member of a board, commission (not including the city commission) or committee of the city is not prohibited from appearing or representing any private interests as set out above so long as the board, commission or committee on which such member services has no jurisdiction or discretionary authority over the particular matter or city employee involved therein, as a witness or otherwise. 
(3)  Prohibition against securing special privileges, consideration or exemption. No city official shall use his official position to secure special privilege, or consideration, or exemption for himself or for others. 
(4)  Gifts. 
a.  No city official shall accept or solicit any contribution, gift or favor that is: 
1.  Solicited, offered or given with the intent to influence the judgment or discretion of such city official; or 
2.  Solicited, offered or given in consideration of the favorable exercise of such city official's judgment or discretion in the past. 
b.  To avoid even the appearance and risk of impropriety, city officials shall not solicit or accept any gift, favor or benefit from any person doing business with, seeking to do business with, or being regulated by, the city. 
c.  As used in this subsection (4), the term "gift" means a favor, hospitality, economic benefit, product or item having a value of $100.00 or more. 
1.  A gift does not include campaign contributions reported as required by state law, or money, items, or benefits received from a relative if given on account of kinship, or any value received by will, intestate succession, or as a distribution from an inter vivos or testamentary trust established by a spouse or ancestor; 
2.  A gift does not include pens, pencils, calendars, T-shirts, caps and similar items containing logos, slogans, company names or other marketing material and commonly given out for advertising purposes. 
3.  A gift does not include food, lodging, transportation, or entertainment accepted as a guest if the benefit is used solely to defray expenses which accrue in the performance of duties or activities in connection with office which are nonreimbursable by the city or which are in excess of the amount reimbursed by the city. 
(5)  Disclosure or use of confidential information. No city official or former city official shall disclose any confidential information gained by reason of his office or employment with the city, including executive sessions, or use such confidential information to advance any personal interest, financial or otherwise, of such official or others. 
(6)  Use of city property for personal use. No city official shall use city supplies, equipment, vehicles, or facilities for any purpose other than the conduct of official city business, unless otherwise specifically provided for by law, ordinance, or city policy. This section shall not apply to minimal personal use of city supplies, equipment or facilities, such as infrequent and reasonable use of city phones for personal matters. 
(7)  Incompatible outside activities. No city official shall engage in any outside activity which will conflict with, or be incompatible with, his city office or employment. 
(8)  Incompatible employment. No city official shall accept outside employment which is incompatible with the full and proper discharge of his duties and responsibilities with the city, or which might impair his independent judgment in the performance of his public duty.

(a)  An alarm system permit holder may appeal the assessment of an excessive false alarm service fee to the city municipal court by filing a written request for a hearing setting forth the reasons for the appeal within ten days after the assessment of the service fee.

A permit issued under this article does not create a contract, either express or implied, or a duty or guarantee of response by the police or fire departments. The city retains immunity from liability and suit based on a decision by the police or fire department not to respond to an activation or a permitted alarm system. 
Sec. 14-65. - Alarm systems in apartment complexes.

(b)  Each tenant shall obtain a permit from the chief of police before operating or causing the operation of the alarm system.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 28-114. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Any product or service includes any physical or material object or item; or any service of whatsoever nature; or any property right of any value represented by oral or written promise or contract. 
    Designated, established business location within Cameron, Willacy, or Hidalgo Counties, Texas, means the ownership and occupancy of a lot or other tract of land and building thereon within Cameron, Willacy, or Hidalgo Counties, Texas, used by the person, or the person he may represent, in direct selling of the product or service within the city; or the leasing or renting of a building within Cameron, Willacy, and Hidalgo Counties, Texas, by such person, or the person he may represent, such building being used in the direct selling of the product or service within the city, provided that such leasing or renting of such building is for a continuous period of time, or not less than 90 days. 
    Designated, established residence within Cameron, Willacy, or Hidalgo Counties, Texas, means the ownership and legal and continuous occupancy of a lot or other tract of land and residence located thereon within Cameron, Willacy, or Hidalgo Counties, Texas, by such person, or by the person he may represent; or by the prior continuous occupancy for a period of not less than 90 days of rented or leased quarters within Cameron, Willacy, or Hidalgo Counties, Texas, by such person, or the person he represents, as the only residence or place of abode of either such person. 
    Itinerant and transient vendor means any person representing himself or representing another person selling any product or service within the city, neither of which such person, or the person he may represent, has a designated, established residence or business location within Cameron, Willacy, or Hidalgo Counties, Texas. 
    Lower Rio Grande Valley. The purpose of the distinction of a Cameron, Willacy, or Hidalgo County residence or business situs, as provided for in the preceding definitions, is as follows: Cameron, Willacy, and Hidalgo Counties are adjacent counties, comprising what is commonly known as the Lower Rio Grande Valley of the state. The three counties, by their population and geographical make up, comprise numerous towns and cities, in close proximity to each other, and comprise a dense suburban and rural population. The area is served by a common telephone directory with direct dialing facilities for any phone number in the area, with the exception of the City of Weslaco area in Hidalgo County. The area is further served by a common Valley Chamber of Commerce and a large number of businesses with one or more business houses serving such area. Furthermore, there is a close liaison between the investigative and law enforcement agencies between the towns, cities, and counties of the area, and the area is generally recognized as a consolidated, metropolitan area. Because of the foregoing, facilities are available to the city for a ready and thorough determination of the existence or absence of fraud or other misrepresentation or wrong doing in the operation of individuals and business in such area in a minimum of time and at no expense, or, at the least, a nominal expense; whereas, the conducting of a sufficient investigation of an individual or business entity beyond the three-county area (or Lower Rio Grande Valley Area) will entail more than nominal expense and time. 
    Selling includes selling or leasing or renting direct to the ultimate owner or user of such product or service, or to the agent or ether representative of the ultimate owner or user of such product or service, whether such selling involves the delivery of the product or service at the time of the sale, or the taking of orders for future delivery and whether such selling involves payment in advance, payment on delivery (by whatever means of delivery), or deferred payment after the delivery, of the product or service sold.

In addition to any punishment specified in this section, the court may order any violator to make restitution to the victim for the damages or loss caused directly or indirectly by the violator's offense in the amount or manner determined by the court. In the case of a minor, the parents shall be ordered jointly and severally liable with the minor to make the restitution. 
(3)  Community service. In lieu of or a part of the penalties specified in this section, a minor or adult may be required to perform community service as described by the court, based on the following requirements: 
a.  The minor or adult shall perform at least 30 hours of community service. 
b.  At least one parent of the minor shall be in attendance at a minimum of 50 percent of the period of assigned community service. 
c.  Reasonable efforts shall be made to assign the minor or adult to a type of community service that is reasonably expected to have the most rehabilitative effect in the minor or adult, including community service that involves graffiti removal. 
(e)  Removal by perpetrator. Any person applying graffiti on public or private property shall have the duty to remove the graffiti within 24 hours after notice by the city or private owner of the property involved. Such removal shall be done in a manner prescribed by the city manager (or the designee of the city manager). Any person applying graffiti shall be responsible for the removal or the payment of the removal. Failure of any person to remove graffiti or pay for the removal shall constitute an additional violation of this section. It is a separate violation for each 24-hour period after notice a person fails to remove the graffiti. Where graffiti is applied by a minor, the parents shall be responsible for such removal or for the payment for the removal. 
(f)  Nuisance declared. Graffiti which is located in any place where it is visible from a public right-of-way is detrimental to the safety and general welfare of the general public, tending to reduce the value of private property, to invite vandalism and other criminal offenses, creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, and is detrimental to the economic welfare of the city by producing urban blight which is adverse to the maintenance and continuing development of the city, and is therefore declared to be public nuisance. To effectively deal with the nuisance of graffiti, the city hereby adopts the procedures for abatement and removal of graffiti in subsection (g) of this section and said procedures may be utilized by police department officers and code enforcement officers when dealing with the nuisance created by graffiti. 
(g)  Graffiti abatement procedures. 
(1)  Authority. The city manager shall designate the appropriate city staff to enforce the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Abatement. Whenever the designated city staff determine that graffiti on any structure is visible from the street or other public property, they may issue an abatement notice to the owner of the property. 
(3)  Notice; action. Upon finding a violation, a written abatement notice may be served upon the owner in control of the affected premises, giving notice that the property is in violation of this section and that graffiti on the premises must be removed within 24 hours after the date of the notice. Such notice shall state further that if the condition is not corrected within 24 hours of such notice, the city will, without further notice, abate this public nuisance by removing or painting over the graffiti. The cost of this action will be assessed by the city, and, therefore, at no cost to the owner of the property.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 34-62. - Loitering. 
(a)  A person commits a violation if he loiters or prowls in a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting the person to identify himself and to explain his presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the suspect's escape. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a police officer, or where a "no loitering" sign has been posted, to loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk, street, curb, crosswalk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any building open to the public. 
(c)  For the purpose of this section, the term "public place" has the following definition, unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets, sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles (whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

Sec. 36-106. - Park rules and policies. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided, all parks, recreational facilities, and golf courses of the city shall be closed from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the curfew provisions provided in subsection (a) of this section, the curfew shall not apply to activities specifically sponsored by the city or activities authorized through contract or interlocal agreement that take place at city parks, recreational facilities, or golf courses. The curfew provisions provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall not apply if waived by a permit granted by the city manager, as provided for in subsection (c) of this section. Further, this section shall not be construed to apply to city buildings available for rental by the public that are located in city parks, for there are rules and regulations governing the use and hours of said buildings. 
(c)  (1)  Any person, group, or organization desiring to engage in any organized recreational, political, educational, or other activity in the public park property of the city that will cause exclusive or semi-exclusive use of that park for that activity shall first obtain a park permit for the activity from the city manager as herein provided. Public park property is not available for rent; however, within city parks, facilities such as swimming pools, pavilions, and sports fields are available for rent on a limited basis. Any person, group, or organization desiring a variance to the rules and regulations of these facilities must also obtain a park permit. 
(2)  Applications for permits shall be made at the parks and recreation department on a form prepared by the city.

(3)  The parks and recreation director shall make a recommendation regarding the request on its approval/disapproval and on any conditions recommended for approval. The completed park permit application will then be forwarded to the city manager for action. 
(4)  The city manager shall review the application and may approve the application, disapprove the application, approve the application with staff recommended conditions, or require additional conditions for approval. The city manager may decline to issue a park permit if he determines: 
a.  The purpose for which the public park property is to be used is unlawful; 
b.  The time, place, or manner of use is likely to cause substantial disturbance to persons residing in the surrounding area, or to businesses, or to schools located nearby, or is likely to result in damage to city property, or does not provide for a starting or stopping time for said use; or 
c.  For any other reasons as the city manager, in his sole discretion, may deem adequate. 
(5)  If the city manager declines to issue a park permit on the above grounds, he may suggest to the applicant some other more appropriate time and place, if any, at which the proposed activity could be held and for which the city manager would be willing to issue a permit; or may suggest some modifications in the manner of use to alleviate or minimize the risk of substantial disturbance, destruction of city property, or other factor which, if modified, would cause the city manager to issue a permit. If the applicant agrees to the modifications proposed by the city manager, a park permit shall be issued accordingly; otherwise, it shall be denied. 
(6)  The city manager may, in his discretion, require the applicant to post a bond in sufficient amount to indemnify the city against anticipated damage to city property, against the expense of special police protection, or against the expense of cleaning up the park property after the event has occurred. The posting of such a bond may be made a condition precedent to the issuance of a park permit, but the bond shall not be excessive in the amount nor be in an amount in excess of the city's anticipated expenditures with respect to the activity for which the permit is sought. Any bond required will be in addition to the liability insurance requirement for all permits listed below. 
(7)  Any applicant refused a permit may appeal the city manager's decision to the city commission by filing a request for review with the city secretary within five working days after the applicant receives written notice of such adverse determination. The city secretary shall place the request for review on the agenda of the next regular or special meeting of the city commission. The decision of the city commission upon such appeal shall be final. 
(8)  When a park permit is approved, the applicant shall furnish to the city a certificate of liability insurance in the amounts required on the application form that names the city as an additional insured for the activity. A permit fee as established in the city fee schedule in chapter 18 is hereby established to cover the city's cost of processing the approved permit. This fee shall be nonrefundable, regardless of whether the permit is used or not. 
(9)  The park permit issued hereunder shall be set forth with particularity the conditions upon which the permit is issued, including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Date, start time, and finish time for which the permit is effective; 
b.  The activities authorized under such permit; 
c.  The area or facility that the permit holder is authorized to use; and 
d.  Such other conditions as the city manager has deemed appropriate as detailed above.

Such equipment is allowed within the fenced area of rental pavilions and other fenced rental facilities.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Access line means: 
(1)  Each access line consisting of provider's transmission media that are located between the end user customer's premises network interface within the city and the provider's local serving facilities (these serving facilities include central office facilities, distribution frame facilities, or other similar facilities) and that allow delivery of telecommunication services within the city; and 
(2)  Each termination point within the city of a non-switched telephone circuit consisting of provider's transmission media dedicated for use between specific locations identified by an end user customer. Interoffice-transport and other transmission media that do not terminate at an end user customer's network interface device are not access lines that would be separately identified and counted for the purposes of assessing the monthly line fee. 
    Affiliate means a person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a provider. The term "affiliate" does not include a person who serves end use customers by means of a wireless transmission. There is a rebuttable presumption of control if a provider owns at least 25 percent of the affiliate's stock or assets. 
    Area , as used in section 44-44(b), means the corporate limits of the city. 
    City means the City of Harlingen, Texas. As used throughout, the term "city" also includes the designated agent of the city.

(Code 1997, § 120.09; Ord. No. 97-52, 9-19-1997) 
Sec. 44-28. - Compensation to city. 
(a)  Generally. To compensate the city for the use and occupancy of the rights-of-way, a provider shall pay the city a monthly line fee for each access line owned and/or leased by provider as calculated as of month-end, that is activated for use by an end use customer. 
(1)  Line fee. 
a.  Following the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, a provider shall submit to the director, on a quarterly basis, a certified statement with the line fee payment under section 44-29, indicating the number of access lines for the customer classes indicated herein used to provide telecommunications services at month end, for each month of the quarter. The statement shall be provided on a form prescribed by the director. 
b.  For each month of the quarter for the first year following the effective date of the consent, a provider shall pay a municipal consent fee based on its number of access lines, as shown in the city fee schedule in chapter 18. 
(For purposes of this section only, lines terminating at customers with "Lifeline," "Tel-Assistance," or other service that is similarly discounted for the purpose of advancing universal service to the economically disadvantaged, shall not be included in the lines upon which the fee is calculated.) 
c.  A provider shall report to the director revenue subject to the state telecommunications sales tax within the city on July 15 of each year in a form prescribed by the director. 
(2)  Adjustments to municipal consent fee. 
a.  The total of all line fees paid by the provider each year shall be known as the municipal consent fee. The total of all municipal consent fees by all providers shall be known as the aggregate municipal consent fee. For each year after the year of enactment of this article, the aggregate municipal consent fee and the municipal consent fee for each provider shall be determined by application of the provisions of subsection (a)(2)b of this section. The line fee shall then be calculated (and, if necessary, adjusted) on July 31 of each year following enactment of this article by dividing the adjusted aggregate municipal consent fee by the total number of access lines reported by all providers during the most recent, current reported month. The city shall have the sole discretion to allocate any increases between residential and nonresidential/private line termination categories. The city will provide the providers with the new line fee amount, if any, for each class of line (residential and nonresidential/private line termination) on or before July 31 of each year. The adjusted line fee shall be implemented by the provider on the first day of the calendar month following notification by city of the adjustment, if any. Until such time as the provider is notified of a new line fee amount, the provider shall continue to use current line fee amounts and nothing herein shall be construed so as to require the provider to apply an adjusted line fee retroactively. 
b.  Annually on June 30, the aggregate municipal consent fee shall be adjusted by multiplying the aggregate municipal consent fee for the preceding year (the current year minus one) by a growth factor. (For June 30, 1998, the aggregate municipal consent fee for the preceding year shall be the total of all municipal fees by paid by all providers for the year ending June 30, 1997.) The growth factor shall be calculated by dividing the total of all providers' aggregate revenue within the city subject to the state telecommunications sales tax, pursuant to Texas Tax Code § 151.0103, for the 12 month period ending June 30 of the current year by the aggregate revenue within the city subject to the state telecommunications sales tax for the 12 month period ending June 30 of the preceding year. In the event of a substantial change in services subject to the state telecommunications sales tax, the city may, in its sole discretion, adopt an alternative method of calculating the growth factor so as to result in substantially the same aggregate municipal consent fee. Notwithstanding any calculation made pursuant to this section, in no event shall the adjusted aggregate municipal consent fee for the current year be less than the aggregate municipal consent fee for the preceding year. 
(b)  Number of access lines. Subject to the city's agreement not to disclose this information unless required by law, the provider agrees to provide annually, or as requested by the city, within a reasonable time after receipt of the city's written request, a report showing the number of access lines being maintained or operated by the provider that are serving premises within the city. Such report shall specifically identify lines maintained or operated by the provider that are leased and/or used by holders of SPCOA. The city agrees that the report shall be used solely for the purposes of verifying the number of the provider's access lines serving premises within the city. Upon written request, the provider shall verify the information in the report and, upon reasonable advance notice, all non-customer specific records and other documents required for such verification shall be subject to inspection by the city, expressly excluding any records, documents, or other writings, the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC 2701 et seq. 
(c)  Confidential records. If the provider notifies the city of the confidential nature of any information (including, but not limited to, the information in subsection (b) of this section), reports, documents, or writings, the city agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the information, reports, documents, and writings to the extent permitted by law. Upon receipt by the city of requests for the provider's confidential information, reports, documents, or writings, the city shall notify the provider of the request in writing by facsimile transmission. The city shall furnish the provider with copies of attorney general opinion requests it makes pertaining to the provider's confidential information, reports, documents or writings. 
(d)  No other fees. Unless otherwise provided in this article, the payments due hereunder shall be in lieu of any permit license, approval, inspection, or other similar fees or charges, including, but not limited to, all general business license fees customarily assessed by the city for the use of the rights-of-way against business operating in a similar business that is conducted by the provider. 
(e)  Uncollectibles. The city and provider understand and agree that the provider has a statutory right to pass through to its customers on a pro rata basis any compensation paid to the city for access to the rights-of-way. Any other provision of this franchise agreement notwithstanding, the provider shall not be obligated to pay the city for any access lines or private line termination points, the revenues for which remain uncollectibles. 
(f)  Other telecommunications carriers and providers. Other provisions of this section notwithstanding, the provider shall not include in its monthly count of access lines, and shall not remit a line fee to the city on such lines and points, those access lines that are leased or otherwise provided to another telecommunications carrier or provider for consideration if the other telecommunications carrier or provider declares its intent to both include the leased access line in its own monthly count of such facilities to the city and remit to the city a line fee on those lines and points. A provider that does not own or operate a network and that demonstrates to the director that the lines it utilizes for resale of services from other providers are included in the other provider's fee calculation is not required to comply with the payment requirement of subsection (a)(1)b of this section. A provider excluded from payment requirements pursuant to this section shall report to the director changes in operation that may affect the availability of this payment option before the end of the quarter in which payment would otherwise be required and the provider that leases or otherwise provides the lines to a provider excluded under this section shall report the existence of those lines to city, such lines to include, but not be limited to, lines leased or otherwise provided to SPCOA holders. 
(g)  Public street crossing fee. 
(1)  Any provider which is not required to pay the municipal consent fees, but which utilizes the city's public rights-of-way, shall pay the city the following annual public street crossing fees as established in the city fee schedule in chapter 18: 
a.  A fee per linear foot for each diameter inch or less of underground conduit or wire and for each .250 diameter inch or less of aerial wire that is in the public rights-of-way per annum; and 
b.  A fee for the first street crossing and a fee for every street crossing thereafter. 
(2)  The public street crossing fee shall be due on July 15 of every year, pro rated as applicable. A report as required by the director shall be provided with each annual payment showing the calculation of the payment, including the length of the network and whether it is overhead or underground, as applicable, and the number and name of each street crossing. 
(3)  This fee is to compensate the city for the reasonable rental value of the public rights-of-way used by the provider, and to recover the administrative cost in monitoring and enforcing the provisions of this article. Each municipal consent ordinance requiring payment under this section shall provide that such fee may be adjusted once every two years to properly reflect the reasonable rental value of the public rights-of-way and administrative cost to the city. 
(Code 1997, § 120.10; Ord. No. 97-52, 9-19-1997; Ord. No. 99-79, 12-1-1999) 
Sec. 44-29. - Fee payments. 
    A provider shall remit the line fee on a quarterly basis, together with the certified statement required in section 44-28(a)(1)a. Payment shall be made on or before the 45th day following the close of each calendar quarter for which the payment is calculated and shall be paid by wire transfer to an account designated by the director. 
(Code 1997, § 120.11; Ord. No. 97-52, 9-19-1997) 
Sec. 44-30. - Audits. 
(a)  On 30 days' notice to a provider the city may audit a provider at any time. The provider shall furnish all relevant information to demonstrate its compliance with the consent and/or other provisions of this article. 
(b)  A provider shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts and records of business and operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for a period of five years. If the Federal Communications Commission requires, a provider shall use the system of accounts and the forms of books, accounts, records, and memoranda prescribed in 47 CFR 32 or its successor. The director may require the keeping of additional records or accounts that are reasonably necessary for purposes of identifying, accounting for, and reporting the number of lines used to deliver telecommunication services. The city may examine the provider's books and records, expressly excluding any customer-specific records and any records, documents, or other writings, the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC 2701 et seq. 
(c)  A provider shall make available to the city or the city's designated agent (hereinafter "agent"), for the city or its agent to examine, audit, review and copy, in Harlingen, Texas, on the director's written request, its books and records, including papers, books, accounts, documents, maps, plans and other provider records pertaining to a municipal consent granted under this article. A provider shall fully cooperate in making records available and otherwise assist the city examiner. The city examiner shall not inspect or copy or otherwise demand production of customer-specific information or any records, documents, or other writings, the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC 2701 et seq. 
(d)  The director may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to providers' performance of the terms and conditions of a consent granted under this article. Providers shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. 
(e)  The provisions of this section shall be continuing and shall survive the termination of the consent granted under this article and shall extend beyond the term of the consent granted to the provider and the city shall have all the rights described in this section for so long as the provider is providing any telecommunications services within the city. 
(Code 1997, § 120.12; Ord. No. 97-52, 9-19-1997) 
Sec. 44-31. - Transfer. 
(a)  No consent granted under this article, the assets held by providers for use under such consent which are in the public rights-of-way, any rights or privileges of providers under a consent, either separately or collectively, shall be sold, resold, assigned, transferred or conveyed by providers to any other person, without the prior written consent of the city by ordinance or resolution. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Should the provider sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests under this consent, including such provider's telecommunications network, or attempt to do so, without the city's prior consent, the city may revoke the consent for default, in which event all rights and interest of the provider shall cease. 
(b)  Any transfer in violation of this section shall be null and void and unenforceable. Any change of control of a provider shall constitute a transfer under this section. 
(c)  There shall be a rebuttable presumption of a change of control of a provider upon a change of 15 percent or greater in the ownership of such provider. Such a change in control shall be deemed a transfer which requires consent of the city. 
(d)  A mortgage or other pledge of assets to a bank or lending institution in a bona fide lending transaction shall not be considered an assignment or transfer. 
(e)  Every consent granted under this article shall specify that any transfer or other disposition of rights which has the effect of circumventing payment of required consent fees and/or evasion of payment of such fees by non-collection or non-reporting of revenues derived from telecommunications services, bartering or any other means which evade the actual collection of revenues for business pursued by a provider is prohibited. 
(Code 1997, § 120.13; Ord. No. 97-52, 9-19-1997) 
Sec. 44-32. - Notices to city. 
(a)  A provider shall notify the director and the city attorney in writing contemporaneously with the transmittal of all petitions, applications, and reports submitted by the provider to the Federal Communications Commission and the public utility commission, or their successor agencies relating to matters affecting both the telecommunications services of the provider within the city and the use of the city's rights-of-way as authorized by a municipal consent granted under this article. A provider shall furnish the director copies of the documents upon request. 
(b)  If a provider notifies the city of the confidential nature of information, the director shall maintain the confidentiality of the information to the extent permitted by law.

(Code 1997, § 120.14; Ord. No. 97-52, 9-19-1997) 
Sec. 44-33. - Circumvention of fee prohibited. 
    A person may not circumvent payment of line fees or evade payment of fees by bartering, transfer of rights, or by any other means that result in undercounting a provider's number of lines. Capacity or services may be bartered if the imputed lines are reported in accordance with section 44-28. 
(Code 1997, § 120.15; Ord. No. 97-52, 9-19-1997) 
Sec. 44-34. - Construction obligations. 
(a)  A provider is subject to the police powers of the city, other governmental powers, and the city's rights as a property owner under state and federal laws. A provider is subject to city requirements and federal and state rules in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of facilities in the rights-of-way. 
(b)  A provider shall place certain facilities within the rights-of-way underground according to applicable city requirements absent a compelling demonstration by provider that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable or feasible.

(e)  A provider shall perform excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever possible. The city shall waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver. A provider shall minimize interference with the use of public and private property and shall follow the construction directions given by the city. 
(f)  When a provider completes construction work, a provider shall promptly restore the rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. A provider may excavate only for the construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, and maintenance of the provider's facilities. 
(g)  The city may require a provider to allow attachment of other provider's facilities to its poles and conduits, in accordance with the City Charter, state and federal law, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed by the provider and the other provider. 
(h)  A provider shall furnish the city with construction plans and maps showing the routing of new construction at least 45 days before beginning construction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way. A provider may not begin construction until the plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the director of public works. 
(i)  For construction that involves a minor alteration to the surface or subsurface of the rights-of-way, and does not involve the routing of new facilities, the city shall implement a streamlined permitting process of less than five days.

Sec. 48-133. - Water connection fees. 
(a)  Fee schedule. As a prerequisite for connecting to the water system, the waterworks system utility trustees adopted a schedule of fees designed to recover installation and oversizing costs of the water system. A description of the various fees follows: 
(1)  Front footage charge. 
a.  Front footage shall be charged to each lot, block, or parcel of property which abuts a water main installed and/or paid for by a third party developer or the waterworks system. Front footage charges will not be applicable within subdivisions or other developments when a complete central water system was provided as a part of the development. Front footage and fire protection charges are due and payable prior to connection to the water system. 
b.  Front footage charges for water mains which serve adjoining property on both sides of the water main shall be based on the size of the main serving the property or that portion of an oversized main required to serve the property (eight-inch minimum). If a parcel of property has or will have, due to a developer installed extension, water lines on more than one side, but service from only one side, the front footage will be chargeable for the average of the sides abutting the water mains. However, parcels of property served from more than one side shall pay the front footage for all sides from which service is rendered. Front footage charges for water mains which can serve property on only one side of the water main, such as along an expressway, shall be twice the charges as noted above. 
c.  The front footage charge shall be set from time to time by the utility trustees to be based on the estimated cost to recover the installation of the waterlines installed in accordance with subsection (a)(1)b of this section. 
(2)  Fire hydrant charge. 
a.  Fire hydrant charges are designed to recover the cost of installing fire hydrants to meet the criteria of the state board of insurance. If an adequate number of fire hydrants and/or system flow capability does not meet the current state board of insurance requirements, new customers will be required to pay the actual cost of upgrading the fire protection service. 
b.  The fire hydrant charge shall be set from time to time by the utility trustees to be based upon the estimated cost to recover the installation of the fire hydrants installed in accordance with subsection (a)(2)a of this section. 
(3)  Water meter installation charge. 
a.  Upon written application and payment to the waterworks system for the charges required herein, the waterworks system shall furnish all labor, material, and equipment necessary, in accordance with the standard construction specifications of the waterworks system, to provide water service to the customer's property line. Each applicant shall pay to the waterworks system, prior to the installation and/or initial use, a water meter installation charge. 
b.  Backflow preventers shall be required by the waterworks system or its designate if deemed necessary to protect the water system from possible contamination. 
c.  Water meter installation charges shall be set from time to time by the utility trustees to be based on the estimated cost to recover installation of the said water meters. 
(4)  Construction inspection charge. 
a.  The construction inspection charge recovers the costs of providing construction inspection services for new water line construction. The construction inspection charge shall cover normal construction service from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through Saturday, excluding holidays. Contractors wanting to work on Sundays, holidays, or extra long hours shall make prior arrangements with the waterworks system and will be required to pay the actual cost of this additional inspection service in addition to the fees charged for normal workday installation. 
b.  Construction inspection charges shall be set from time to time by the utility trustees to be based upon the estimated cost to recover the cost of providing construction inspectors as required by the preceding subsection (a)(4)a of this section. 
(b)  Fees for services outside city limits. The water connection fees for the preceding subsection (a) of this section shall be 150 percent of those set forth in said subsection for services provided outside the city limits. 
(Code 1973, §§ 30-120, 30-121; Code 1997, § 51.043; Ord. No. 81-96, 12-23-1981; Ord. No. 83-97, 11-16-1983) 
Sec. 48-134. - Service to extraterritorial areas; option by waterworks system. 
    The waterworks system shall have the sole option of agreeing to extend its water system services to entities, including proposed new subdivisions, located outside the city limits, but within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction area. In the event the waterworks system agrees to extend such water system service to such extraterritorial areas, all of the provisions of this division shall apply as stated. 
(Code 1973, § 30-130; Code 1997, § 51.044; Ord. No. 81-96, 12-23-1981) 
Sec. 48-135. - Water system reimbursement, repair and replacement fund. 
    The funds collected by the waterworks system from the payments of front footage charges as provided for in section 48-133(a)(1) shall be maintained in a separate and specially designated waterworks system account; and such funds shall be used only to reimburse the subdivision developer who originally installed and paid for off-site water mains as provided for in section 48-132 with the remainder to be used exclusively for the replacement, repair, and maintenance of water mains of the water system. 
(Code 1973, § 30-135; Code 1997, § 51.045; Ord. No. 81-96, 12-23-1981; Ord. No. 90-70, 7-18-1990) 
Sec. 48-136. - Final control exercised by utility trustees. 
    Any of the decisions of or other actions of the general manager of the waterworks system as herein provided for shall be subject to prior review and approval by the utility trustees, as it may specify from time to time.

Sec. 48-184. - Basis for charges. 
    It is hereby determined and declared to be necessary for the city to levy and collect charges from all persons using the sanitary sewer system and lines of the city. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has mandated that local charges for furnishing sewer service, including processing the effluent, shall be based upon the amount of water consumed by each user and introduced into the sanitary sewer system. Accordingly, the charges for sanitary sewer service furnished by the city as hereinafter established shall be based upon a fixed charge and in addition thereto the amount of water delivered to each metered user within the city in the amount as hereinafter set forth in this division, such hereinafter enumerated rates being based upon factors a major one of which is the cost to the city of electric power purchased and consumed by it in furnishing such sanitary sewer service. And with such electric power costs being subject to substantial variance from time to time, the hereinafter specified rate shall be subject to adjustment from time to time by the administration of the city without further amendment hereto, with such adjustments up or down being in proportion to the increase or decrease of the cost of such electric power from that existing upon the date of the determination of the herein listed rates and at the proportion that such electric power expense bears to the other expenses incurred by the city in furnishing such sanitary sewer service, with such administrative adjustment of such rates from time to time to in effect result from a "flow through" of increased or decreased electric power costs to the city in furnishing such sanitary sewer service, and with such rates to be evidenced by publication as a legal notice in a newspaper published daily and distributed in the city, such publication to be on the same day of two consecutive weeks with the last such publication date being not less than seven days prior to the effective date of such adjusted rates. 
(Code 1973, § 30-15; Code 1997, § 51.016; Ord. No. 59-11, 5-6-1959; Ord. No. 72-30, 9-20-1972; Ord. No. 77-27, 5-18-1977; Ord. No. 80-46, 6-4-1980) 
Sec. 48-185. - Standard sewer rates. 
    The standard sewer rates for all sewer service to each residential and nonresidential metered customer shall be as follows: 
(1)  Sewer commodity rate. The sewer commodity rate for each metered customer is per 1,000 gallons of sewage, but will be charged per 100 gallons of use. 
(2)  Monthly ready to serve. 
a.  The rates for consumption billed October 2014 are found in the city fee schedule in chapter 18. 
b.  For each subsequent month, the monthly ready to serve rate for all meter sizes and locations shall be increased as established in the city fee schedule in chapter 18 each month for 40 consecutive months. 
(Code 1997, § 51.017; Ord. No. 05-66, 11-2-2005; Ord. No. 08-57, 9-3-2008; Ord. No. 12-2, § 1, 1-9-2012; Ord. No. 14-35, 9-3-2014) 
Sec. 48-186. - Charge for single-family residential. 
    For single-family residences, the amount of water metered to such residence each month would result in such a gross inaccurate calculation of effluent from such users being introduced into the sanitary sewer system of the city that a separate calculation for such user is necessitated. 
(1)  Beginning March 1 of each year, the Harlingen Waterworks System shall review the account of each single-family residential customer to determine the amount of water consumption by such user for billing cycles ending in December, January, and February. The number of gallons used by such user during said three months shall be averaged and such averaged amount of gallons shall be referred to as an average monthly rate (AMR) of such user. The AMR or the actual gallons of water used each month, whichever is lower, is hereby established as the monthly amount of sewerage effluent that each single-family residential user introduces into the sanitary sewer system of the city. The AMR or the actual gallons of water used each month, whichever is lower, is the amount of gallons on which will be calculated the sewer charges assessed against and billed to such users, in addition to the applicable ready to serve charge. 
(2)  If a single-family residential user has a separate water meter for a sprinkler system for the residence, the actual gallons of water used each month through the domestic meter is the amount of gallons on which will be calculated the sewer charges assessed and billed to such user, in addition to the applicable ready to serve charge. 
(3)  In the event a new single-family residential home connection, having no prior history upon which a calculation can be made to utilize the AMR as hereinafter set forth, and such users do not have a separate water meter for a sprinkler system for the residence, a ready to serve charge based on the size of the water meter, plus the sewer commodity rate for up to 7,000 gallons of sewer per month, is hereby established to stay in full force and effect as the rate for such new single-family residential user from the date of completion of a new home or until such single-family residential user can establish an AMR as described in subsection (1) of this section. In the event the user has a sprinkling meter then the sewer charges shall be computed in accordance with subsection (2) of this section. 
(Code 1997, § 51.018; Ord. No. 08-57, 9-3-2008) 
Sec. 48-187. - Discontinuation of service upon failure to pay; reconnection. 
(a)  All bills for service rendered by the sewer system shall be payable monthly within 20 days after the billing date, and unless paid within this period, a ten percent penalty will be assessed. 
(b)  Any person who shall fail to pay the sewer charge and/or rental as levied and assessed in this division within 30 days from the billing date shall be subject to have their sewer disconnected from the city's sewer system and thereafter no sewer connection which has been disconnected for the nonpayment of charges shall be again reconnected until all costs incurred in the actual physical disconnect and reconnect have been paid and all delinquent sewer service charges have been paid or mutually agreed upon terms have been arranged. 
(Code 1997, § 51.019; Ord. No. 08-57, 9-3-2008)

Sec. 48-225. - Connecting to existing oversized main or lift station; fee. 
    The utility department may allow newly proposed subdivisions and/or wastewater disposing facilities of other entities to tie on to preinstalled oversized gravity mains and/or oversized lift stations, when such properties are adjacent to or in the serviceable area of such oversized gravity mains and/or lift stations, under the following conditions: 
(1)  Newly proposed subdivisions and other entities requiring city wastewater service may be allowed, by the utility department, to tie on to previously installed oversized gravity mains and/or oversized lift stations, when such newly proposed subdivisions or other entities are located adjacent to or in the area contemplated to be serviced by such preinstalled oversized mains and/or lift stations, and under conditions of the utility department having predetermined that such proposed new subdivision or subdivisions or other entities may be adequately serviced by such preinstalled, oversized mains and/or lift stations. The utility department shall determine, by best estimate, the maximum amount of wastewater discharge required to be serviced for such proposed new subdivision and further determine the percentage the same constitutes of the maximum handling capacity of such oversized gravity main and/or lift station. This percentage shall then be multiplied by the cost of installation of such lift station and the cost of installation of that portion of such oversized gravity main between the point of tie-on and such lift station and/or down flow terminal point of such oversized gravity main, and the total of such resulting products shall constitute the tie-on fee. 
(2)  Permit for such tie-on shall be granted by the utility department upon its satisfactory determination of the foregoing and upon payment to the city of such tie-on fee. Such tie-on fee shall be in addition to tap fees and/or user fees as hereinafter provided for.

Sec. 48-226. - Conditional reimbursement to developer. 
(a)  The utility department shall make its best estimate of the maximum amount of wastewater disposal required to be handled by the subdivision originally installing such oversized gravity main and/or lift station. The utility department shall then determine that percentage of the maximum carrying capacity of such oversized gravity main and/or lift station which will be required to process such maximum estimated amount of wastewater disposal by such original subdivision. This percentage figure shall then be multiplied by the total original cost of the installation of such oversized gravity main and/or lift station by the developer installing same, and such figure or amount shall be the fixed cost of the portion of such oversized main and/or lift station attributable to such original subdivision installing same, which such amount will not be refunded to the developer. Such fixed cost amount shall then be subtracted from the total original cost of such oversized gravity mains or lift stations, and the remainder shall again be reduced by the amount to be unconditionally reimbursed to the installing developer under provisions of section 48-224(b). The remaining amount shall be the amount subject to conditional reimbursement to the installing developer (conditional reimbursable amount). 
(b)  (1)  In the event the utility department collects tie-on fees from tie-ons to such oversized gravity mains and/or lift stations, under the provisions of section 48-225, it shall disburse from such collected tie-on fees amounts to the developer originally installing such oversized mains and/or lift stations as follows: 
a.  An amount up to but not exceeding 100 percent of the predetermined conditional reimbursable amount, if sufficient amount from such sources is available during the first four years after the original installation of such oversized mains and/or lift stations. 
b.  In the event, and only in the event, less than 66 2/3 percent of the predetermined conditional reimbursable amount has been reimbursed to the developer during such first four years, such additional amount as is required to result in reimbursement to such developer of a total of 66 2/3 percent of the predetermined conditional reimbursable amount shall be reimbursed to the developer during the fifth through the eighth years after the original installation of such oversized mains and/or lift stations, if a sufficient amount from such sources becomes available during such fifth through eighth years. 
c.  In the event, and only in the event, less than 33 1/3 percent of the predetermined conditional reimbursable amount has been reimbursed to the developer during the first through eighth years after the original installation of such oversized mains and/or lift stations, such additional amount as is required to result in reimbursement to such developer of a total of 33 1/3 percent of the predetermined conditional reimbursable amount shall be reimbursed to such developer during the ninth and tenth years after the original installation of such oversized mains and/or lift stations, if a sufficient amount from such sources becomes available during such ninth and tenth years. 
(2)  The reduction of the amount to be reimbursed for such conditional reimbursable amount during the fifth through eighth years, and/or during the ninth and/or tenth years after installation, is based upon the intervening deterioration and/or lift stations during such later years, with the utility department to retain any surplus unreimbursed amounts, as a result of such later years' reductions, for replacement and/or repair costs to such oversized mains and/or lift stations caused from such depreciation and deterioration.

(a)  Each entity tying on to a city wastewater main for the direct disposal of the wastewater and other permissible liquid sewerage of such entity into the city wastewater system, with such tap-on being by means of lateral from the premises of such entity to such wastewater main, shall, to obtain tap permit, pay a tap fee to the utility department calculated as follows: 
(1)  For a four-inch diameter size lateral tap line, a fee as established in the city fee schedule in chapter 18 plus an inspection fee as established in the city fee schedule; provided that, in the event that the length of such lateral line exceeds 25 feet from the city wastewater main to the property line of such tapping entity, an additional fee as established in the city fee schedule per lineal foot for each foot in excess of 25 feet; and provided, further, that in the event the depth of the city wastewater main at the point of tap requires the lateral line to be installed at a depth in excess of six feet below ground level, there shall be an additional tap fee as established in the city fee schedule per foot of each lineal foot of lateral tap line for each foot of additional depth of such tap line below six feet. 
(2)  For a six-inch diameter size lateral tap line, a fee as established in the city fee schedule in chapter 18 plus an inspection fee as established in the city fee schedule; provided that, in the event that the length of such lateral line exceeds 25 feet from the city wastewater main to the property line of such tapping entity, an additional charge as established in the city fee schedule per lineal foot for each foot in excess of 25 feet shall be made; and provided, further, that in the event the depth of the city wastewater main at the point of tap requires the lateral line to be installed at a depth in excess of six feet below ground level, there shall be an additional tap fee as established in the city fee schedule in chapter 18 per lineal foot of each foot of lateral tap line for each foot of additional depth of such tap line below six feet. 
(3)  The utility department shall have sole discretion in determining whether or not the tapping entity shall require a four-inch diameter size lateral tap line, or a six-inch diameter size lateral tap line, or a lateral tap line with a larger diameter than six inches. In the event a lateral tap line with a diameter in excess of six inches is required by the utility department, the entity making such lateral connection to the city wastewater main shall pay the actual cost incurred by the utility department in making and installing such tap from the city's wastewater gravity main to the property line of such tapping entity. Such expenses shall be solely determined by the city but shall be fair and reasonable, and commensurate with prevailing municipal wages and other construction and installation costs. 
(4)  If the entity tying on to a city wastewater main under the provisions of this division installs at its expense such lateral from the boundary of its premises to such wastewater main, or, in the further event such lateral from such wastewater main to the boundary of the premises of the entity to tie on to same have been preinstalled by a developer or other entity, then, in either of such events, the tap fee provided for in subsections (a)(1) through (4) of this section shall be waived, and only the inspection fee shall be charged to tap on to city wastewater main. 
(b)  The tap fees provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall be doubled when made for designated entities located outside of the city limits but within the extraterritorial jurisdiction area of the city. Provided, further, that in the event any entity paying such double amount fees should be annexed by the city within three years from the date of the payment of such fees, a portion thereof shall be refunded as follows: 50 percent thereof if annexation occurs within one year from the date of original payment and connection; 37.5 percent thereof if annexation occurs after two years of the date of such connection and payment; and 20 percent if annexation occurs after two years but within three years of such date of connection and payment.

2.  An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system. Industrial users anticipating a bypass must submit written notice to the general manager at least ten days in advance. The general manager, as an agent of the utility board of trustees, may only approve the anticipated bypass if the circumstances satisfy those set forth in subsection (2)c.1 of this section 
(3)  Harlingen Waterworks System's right of revision. The control authority reserves the right to amend this section at any time to establish more stringent specific pollutant limitations or requirements on indirect discharges to the system if deemed necessary to protect the POTW processes or to correct or prevent an effluent quality problem in treated wastewater and/or resulting sludges. 
(4)  Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. 
a.  When promulgated, federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular category, if more stringent than the limitation imposed by this subdivision for users in that category or subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this subdivision.

In all cases, the user's industrial waste discharge permit will designate the point where the limits shall apply. The POTW shall notify all affected users of the applicable pretreatment requirements. 
b.  The control authority shall follow the procedures for the development and evaluation of its local limits, categorical pretreatment standards using the EPA's Guidance Manual on the Development and Implementation of Local Discharge Limitations under the Pretreatment Program. 
c.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the control authority may impose equivalent concentrations or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e). The more stringent national categorical pretreatment standards shall supersede the limitations imposed under section 48-280 for that particular category. 
d.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the control authority shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). Fixed alternative methods may be derived by the control authority or by the industrial user with the written concurrence of the control authority. These alternative limits shall be applied at the end-of-pipe. When deriving alternative categorical limits, the control authority or industrial user shall calculate both an alternative daily maximum value using the daily maximum values specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards and an alternative consecutive sampling day average using the monthly average values specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards. The industrial user shall comply with the alternative daily maximum and monthly average limits fixed by the control authority until the control authority modifies the limits or approves an industrial user modification request. Modification is authorized whenever there is a material or significant change in the values used in the calculation to fix alternative limits for the regulated pollutant. An industrial user must immediately report any such material or significant change to the control authority. Where appropriate, new alternative categorical limits shall be calculated within 30 days. 
e.  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
f.  In those situations in which the nondomestic discharger believes it is not subject to the standards, the control authority has developed a procedure for the nondomestic discharger to obtain a category determination. This procedure is outlined in 40 CFR 403, Appendix D. 
g.  The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR 405-471, are hereby fully incorporated into this subdivision. 
(5)  State requirements. 
a.  Specific pollutant requirements and limitations which have been or may be enacted by the state on indirect discharges shall immediately supersede and replace the requirements and limitations imposed by this subdivision when the state requirements are more stringent than either the national or control authority standards or requirements. 
b.  The control authority may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentrations based limitations above. 
(Code 1997, § 52.018; Ord. No. 02-49, 5-15-2002) 
Sec. 48-282. - Excessive discharge. 
    No user shall ever increase the use of process or non-processed water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment in order to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this subdivision. 
(Code 1997, § 52.019; Ord. No. 02-49, 5-15-2002) 
Sec. 48-283. - Slug loadings and accidental discharges. 
    Each industrial user shall provide necessary wastewater treatment to comply with and achieve compliance with categorical standards, local limits, and established prohibitions. The industrial user shall provide protection from slug loadings and direct or indirect accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this subdivision. Industrial users will be required to develop slug discharge control plans as required under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v)(A)-(D). Facilities to prevent slug loadings and accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the control authority before construction of the facility may begin. All existing users shall complete and submit such a plan within 180 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this subdivision is derived and implement the plan on a schedule as deemed appropriate by the control authority. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which this subdivision is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the control authority. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this subdivision. 
(1)  Notification by user. In the case of a slug loading, including any accident spill or noncustomary batch discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. The notification shall include the time of discharge, location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. In addition, the permittee shall submit to the control authority a detailed written report within five days following an accidental discharge. The report shall specify: 
a.  Description and cause of the upset, slug load or accidental discharge, the cause thereof, and the impact on the permittee's compliance status. The description should also include the time, location of discharge, type, concentration, and volume of waste. 
b.  Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance and, if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to occur. 
c.  All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and/or prevent recurrence of such an upset, slug load, accidental discharge, or other conditions of noncompliance. 
(2)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(3)  Slug discharge control plan. At least once every two years, the control authority shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges. The control authority may require any user to develop, submit for review, and implement such a plan. When the control authority finds that such a plan is necessary, the industrial user will be required to develop slug discharge control plans as required under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v)(A)-(D). A plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
a.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharge; 
b.  Description of stored chemicals; 
c.  Procedures for immediately notifying the control authority of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by subsection (1) of this section, including any discharge that would result in a violation under 40 CFR 403.5(b) with procedure for follow-up written notification within five days; and 
d.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

Sec. 48-311. - Reporting requirements. 
(a)  Reporting requirements for categorical industrial users. 
(1)  Baseline monitoring report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6 (a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in subsections (a)(1)a through g of this section. Where reports containing this information already have been submitted to the executive director in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140(b) (1977), the industrial user will not be required to submit this information again. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in subsections (a)(1)a through g of this section. New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections (a)(1)d and e of this section. 
a.  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owners. 
b.  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operations carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates point of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
1.  Regulated process streams; and 
2.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6 (e). The control authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where certified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
3.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, where feasible. The control authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
4.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. 
5.  Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities, if such exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards.

(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the control authority may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this subdivision. 
(2)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps shall be provided by the user to properly handle wastewater containing grease and oil, or sand; except that such devices shall not be required for residential users. All interception or trap units shall be of type and capacity approved by the control authority and shall be located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
(e)  Cleaning frequencies. 
(1)  The control authority requires a 90-day minimum cleaning schedule for grease, oil and sand traps. This required cleaning scheduled is, however, only a minimal requirement. The user of the sanitary sewer system is responsible for establishing the most adequate cleaning schedule necessary, to prevent discharging substances prohibited under section 48-279, and/or to ensure that the interceptor or trap properly performs the function intended. 
(2)  Under the sink interceptors shall be cleaned regularly as needed to prevent grease from exiting the interceptors and violating city ordinance. 
(3)  At the user's expense, such interceptors and traps shall be installed, inspected, and repaired regularly, as needed, and/or as specified in section 48-346, to ensure that interceptor or trap properly performs the function intended. 
(4)  Records related to these devices such as waste transporter manifests and other records necessary for the control authority to verify compliance with this subdivision must be kept at the user's facility (on-site) for a period of three years. 
(5)  The use of enzymes or bacteria in the interceptors or traps, in lieu of cleaning the interceptors or traps, is prohibited and will be considered a violation of this subdivision. The use of any processes designed to treat, chemically alter or affect the contents in the interceptors or traps must receive written approval by the control authority prior to the use of such processes.

The pretreatment coordinator shall utilize the format "Preparing a Compliance Summary" when a user in noncompliance fails to return to compliance and procedures for legal action should be initiated. The pretreatment coordinator shall be responsible for preparing and submitting the form titled "Notice of Violation" to publish in the newspaper the users found to be in significant noncompliance. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the users during the same 12 months. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the TNRCC or U.S.E.P.A. upon request. For the purpose of this division, an industrial user is in significant noncompliance if violations meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter. 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH.). 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or longer term average) that the control authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public). 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge. 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance. 
(6)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required reports, such as baseline monitoring reports, 90 day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules. 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance. 
(8)  Any other violation or group of violations which the control authority determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

Sec. 48-388. - Affirmative defense in criminal prosecutions. 
    In any criminal prosecution brought pursuant to section 48-255, the industrial user may offer proof in justification of his act or failure to act, where applicable, as follows: 
(1)  Treatment upsets. 
a.  Any industrial user which experiences an upset in operations that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is not the result of operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation, shall inform the general manager thereof immediately upon becoming aware of the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written report thereof shall be filed by the user within five days. The report shall contain: 
1.  A description of the upset, its causes, and impact on the discharger's compliance status. 
2.  The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance, and, if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to be restored. 
3.  All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of such an upset. 
b.  An industrial user which complies with the notification provisions of this section in a timely manner shall have an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the general manager, as an agent of the utility board of trustees, for any noncompliance with this division, or an order or permit issued hereunder by the user, which arises out of violations attributable to and alleged to have occurred during the period of the documented and verified upset. 
(2)  Treatment bypasses. 
a.  A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited unless all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the use of auxiliary treatment or retention of the wastewater; and 
3.  The industrial user properly notified the general manager, as an agent of the utility board of trustees, as described in subsection (2)b of this section. 
b.  Industrial users must provide immediate notice to the general manager, as an agent of the utility board of trustees, upon discovery of an unanticipated bypass. If necessary, the general manager may require the industrial user to submit a written report explaining the causes, nature, and duration of the bypass, and the steps being taken to prevent this recurrence. 
c.  An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system. Industrial users anticipating a bypass must submit written notice to the general manager at least ten days in advance. The general manager, as an agent of the utility board of trustees, may only approve the anticipated bypass if the circumstances satisfy those set forth in subsection (2)a of this section.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018-6 , §§ I, II(Exh. A), adopted Feb. 7, 2018, repealed the former Ch. 105, §§ 105-1-105-11, 105-41-105-43, 105-75-105-79, and enacted a new Ch. 105 as set out herein. The former Ch. 105 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1973, §§ 31-1-31-12, 31-21-31-24, 31-31-31-35; Code 1997, §§ 154.01-154.11, 154.20, 154.30-154.34, 154.45, 154.46; Ord. No. 87-49, 7-15-1987. 

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 105-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water Code, Section 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Elective Commission of Harlingen, Texas does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 2018-6 , § II(Exh. A), 2-7-2018) 
Sec. 105-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2018-6 , § II(Exh. A), 2-7-2018) 
Sec. 105-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Provide information to potential buyers to determine if property is in a flood area, as defined by FEMA; 
(8)  Avoid increasing flood levels or flood hazards or creating new flood hazard areas; 
(9)  Minimize public and private property losses due to flooding; and 
(10)  Preserve the natural floodplains where at all possible. 
(Ord. No. 2018-6 , § II(Exh. A), 2-7-2018) 
Sec. 105-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish reduction of flood loss, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or control the construction of flood barriers by grading, dredging, excavation and filling which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(6)  Imposing a regulatory 1% annual chance floodplain that requires using the ultimate development of the watershed to determine the 1% annual chance water surface elevations. New developments must be constructed above this elevation.

ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 105-16. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    1% annual chance floodplain (also known as a 100-year floodplain) is the land within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. These areas are typically designated as a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Zone A, AE, AH, or AO on FEMA flood insurance rate maps (FIRM Panels). 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard (area of future flood conditions) means the land area that would be inundated by the one-percent annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one-percent (1%) or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed rate making has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for Zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one-percent (1%) chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year - also called the "base flood." 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building, which has its lowest elevated floor, raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) is an official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation or the base flood, as well as the flood boundary map. Also see flood elevation study. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). The 1% annual chance floodplain is also known as the area of special flood hazard. Also see regulatory floodplain. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway see "regulatory floodway." 
    Functionally dependent use means a use, which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term "functionally dependent use" includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or; 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodplain means the land within the community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year assuming all future development has occurred throughout the watershed. The regulatory floodplain is delineated on the currently effective FEMA flood insurance rate maps (FIRM Panels). NOTE: As the city's floodplain ordinance (Code Section 18) is approved by FEMA as a condition of participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the city's regulatory floodplain is considered FEMA's future base flood. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. The floodway is congruent with the regulatory 1% annual chance floodplain in the city. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area see area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction means, for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The start of construction period is valid for 180 days, provided, however, that the duly designated building official may extend the start of construction period of an additional 180-day period pursuant to the city's Code. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of chapter 105 when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR Section 60.3 (Flood plain management criteria for flood-prone areas) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Application for a floodplain development permit for a proposed subdivision may be presented prior to or in conjunction with other data required for the platting process. For platting purposes, a floodplain development permit shall serve only as an approval of the floodplain ordinance requirements. No cut/or fill, building, or other site alterations shall proceed until the permit is approved. Additionally, the following information shall accompany the permit application: 
(1)  An elevation certificate for buildings on property located in or abutting the floodplain; 
(2)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed; 
(3)  A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria of article V, section (b)(2); 
(4)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; 
(5)  Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with article IV, section (b)(1); 
(6)  An existing structure may be improved (remodeled) without conforming to requirements of this chapter when the improvement does not constitute a substantial improvement. In the event that the work is considered a substantial improvement then the structure must be brought into compliance with this chapter. 
(b)  Approval or denial of a floodplain development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(2)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(5)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(6)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; 
(7)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(8)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(9)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use. 
(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(c)  If a development permit application is disapproved, the floodplain administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the section and specific requirement of this chapter with which the proposed development does not comply and the nature of such noncompliance. 
(Ord. No. 2018-6 , § II(Exh. A), 2-7-2018) 
Sec. 105-44. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The appeal board, as established by the community, shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. The issuance of a variance pursuant to this chapter is for flood plain management purposes only. 
(b)  The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. The appeal board, after a public hearing and examining the applicant's hardships, shall approve or disapprove a request for variance. 
(c)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section (c)(2) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (article I, section (c)). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in article IV, section (d)(1)-(9) are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 105-59. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article III, section (b), are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in article IV, section (c) are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.

Sec. 105-60. - Floodways. 
    Floodways-Located within areas of special flood hazard established in article III, section (b), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If article V, section (e)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article V. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 2018-6 , § II(Exh. A), 2-7-2018) 
Sec. 105-61. - Severability.

ARTICLE II. - VARIANCES AND APPEALS 

Sec. 109-27. - Variances. 
(a)  The planning and zoning commission may recommend to the city commission a variance from this chapter when, in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. The only variance that cannot be granted will be in the area of paving curb and gutter for subdivisions located within the city. 
(b)  Variances from certain requirements hereunder may be recommended by the planning and zoning commission and granted by the city commission for subdivisions located outside of the city limits but within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. Any variances requested must be submitted in writing by separate instrument at the time the preliminary plat is filed with the planning and zoning commission on a form as specified by the city (see section 109-231, Exhibit K). 
(c)  In recommending a variance, the planning and zoning commission shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. In making the finding herein below required, the planning and zoning commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed uses of the land involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, the number of persons who will reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of such variance upon traffic conditions and on the public health, safety, convenience and welfare in the city. No variance shall be recommended unless the planning and zoning commission finds: 
(1)  That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land; 
(2)  That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; 
(3)  That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area; and 
(4)  That the granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly subdivision of other land in the area in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Such findings of the planning and zoning commission, together with the specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into official minutes of the planning and zoning commission meeting at which such variance is recommended. Variances may be recommended only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter so that the public health, safety and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done. Financial hardship to the subdivider, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship. 
(e)  Nothing herein shall prohibit a variance request being initiated or approved by the planning and zoning commission or the city commission upon its own motion and upon a showing of special circumstances or conditions existing in the immediate vicinity of the land involved, such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would be to the detriment of the general health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city as they are related to the areas of traffic movement, utility extension, fire and police protection, and storm sewer and drainage installation. 
(f)  All variances to this chapter must be submitted to the city commission for approval or disapproval. A four-fifths vote of the city commission shall be required to override a recommendation for/or against the variance from the planning and zoning commission. In granting any variance, the city commission shall comply with the provisions of this section. 
(g)  The fee for this procedure is as established in the city fee schedule in chapter 18. (Subject to change by city commission approval.)

ARTICLE IV. - PLAT SUBMITTAL AND REVIEW PROCEDURES[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
State Law reference- Platting, Texas Local Government Code § 212.004 et seq. 

Sec. 109-87. - General process. 
(a)  Subdivision process. 
(1)  a.  The subdivision planning process consists of two separate phases. The initial phase is the preparation and submittal of the preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision; this is the most significant phase in the planning process, as approval of the preliminary plat by the planning and zoning commission will allow for the construction and/or financing of the required public improvements with construction plans approved by the city engineer. The second and final phase is the preparation and submittal of a final plat. 
b.  The final plat becomes the recording instrument in the office of the county clerk when approved by the planning and zoning commission and containing all applicable signatures. Minor plats, replats, and development plats are considered final plats not requiring preliminary approval. 
(2)  The following are major steps in the subdivision process: 
a.  Developer and/or engineer/surveyor may schedule a preliminary conference with city staff and the developer (optional). 
b.  Preparation and timely submittal of a preliminary plat. Deadlines for submittal are available for the calendar year at the department of planning and development, and are generally at least 24 days prior to the monthly planning and zoning commission meeting. City staff will distribute submitted copies to all city departments for review. The applicant is responsible for submittal of a preliminary plat to the appropriate drainage district, if applicable. 
c.  Review of plat by subdivision review committee (along with applicant and/or representative) and subsequent notification to engineer/surveyor and property owner of plat deficiencies by the department of planning and development. 
d.  Timely submittal of revised plats by engineer/surveyor; revised submittal should address all plat deficiencies described in notification. 
e.  Review of revised submittal by city staff for completeness. If not complete, loop back to step (d) of this subsection (2) until plat requirements are met. Completion of this step constitutes a formal plat submittal (plat filing as defined in Texas Local Government Code § 212.009). 
f.  Preliminary plat is placed on the planning and zoning commission agenda for consideration. 
g.  If approved, submit three copies of construction plans and profiles with cost estimates to the department of planning and development. Construction plans will be routed to the city engineer for review/approval. Construction plans released for construction by the city engineer allow for the commencement of construction or for the submittal of an appropriate financing mechanism (i.e., letter of credit) in lieu of said construction. 
h.  Once construction is complete, a letter of acceptance by the public entity will be issued to the engineer and copied to the department of planning and development. Subsequently, a maintenance agreement contract shall be filed with the department of planning and development. Submit a diskette containing "as-built" plans in .dwg or .dgn format. 
i.  Submittal of the final plat shall be subsequent to preliminary plat approval; however, said submittal is not considered a formal plat submittal unless: 
1.  The plat conforms significantly to the approved preliminary plat; 
2.  The required public improvements are completed and accepted by the city or an appropriate financing mechanism has been submitted and accepted by the city; and 
3.  At least two original mylars of the final plat with all signatures other than those that must be obtained by the City of Harlingen (or those that must be obtained after approval by the city if in ETJ) have been submitted. 
j.  Final plat is placed on planning and zoning commission agenda for consideration. The mylar copies of the plat for recordation shall be signed by the chair of the planning and zoning commission at the meeting in which the plat is approved. 
k.  All approved final plats for subdivisions located within the city limits will be filed with the Cameron County Clerk by Harlingen City Staff on a pre-established schedule (available at the department of planning and development). 
l.  Final plats for subdivisions located outside city limits, but within the ETJ, will be delivered to Cameron County Engineering Office on a pre-established schedule (available at the department of planning and development). 
m.  Other approvals may be necessary prior to recordation (such as drainage district or Cameron/Willacy County). Time frames, ability to receive approvals concurrently, and approval processes for such are not included in this article and are the responsibility of the applicant. 
(b)  Responsibility of the subdivider. It is the subdivider's responsibility to satisfy all outside agency requirements, including, but not limited to, drainage and irrigation districts, Cameron County, Texas Department of Transportation, the environmental protection agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the agency on international boundaries water commission. Approval of subdivision by the planning and zoning commission does not represent that the subdivider has met the requirements of any other agency. 
(c)  Series of permits. Approval of a subdivision plat is not tied to nor guarantees issuance of a building permit or zoning. The subdivision process constitutes a separate series of permits, and completion of a subdivision plat does not vest a building permit or any other type of action. 
(d)  Number of dwellings per lot on residential subdivisions. No more than one single-family detached dwelling shall be located on each tract. A notation of this restriction shall be placed on the face of the final plat. This restriction shall be placed in all deeds and contracts for deeds for real estate sold within the subdivision. Notice of this restriction must be given by the seller to purchasers prior to execution of any binding agreement for sale or conveyance of any real estate. Proposals which include multifamily residential dwelling may note this on the plat and therefore not restrict the dwellings to one. They shall also include adequate, detailed planning materials as required for determination of proper water and wastewater utility type and design. 
(Code 1997, § 156.020; Ord. No. 01-01, § 3-1, 1-3-2001; Ord. No. 04-46, 7-21-2004; Ord. No. 07-28, 4-18-2007; Ord. No. 12-8, § I, 2-1-2012; Ord. No. 13-1, § I, 1-16-2013) 
Sec. 109-88. - Minor plat approval delegation. 
    Any person proposing to subdivide a property under the conditions set out below may file a plat directly with the director of planning and development. The director of planning and development, upon the receipt of a plat filed under this section, shall verify the conditions set out below and upon verification thereof is hereby authorized to approve such plat as specified in Texas Local Government Code § 212.0065. Upon such approval, the signature and recording requirements for other plats covered by this section shall be carried out. 
(1)  In order to qualify for approval under this section, the plat must conform to the following requirements: 
a.  There will be no more than four lots in the subdivision; 
b.  All lots front on an existing dedicated public street; 
c.  The subdivision does not require the creation of any new street; 
d.  All lots will be served by existing municipal facilities (water, sewer, drainage); and 
e.  The plat must limit the use of lots for single-family residential units or be limited under appropriate zoning limitations, if in city limits. 
(2)  All information necessary to make this determination must be provided to the director of planning and development for consideration. If the director of planning and development determines that any of the foregoing conditions will not be met in such subdivision, then the subdivision shall be processed as otherwise provided under this article. 
(Code 1997, § 156.021; Ord. No. 01-01, § 3.1-5, 1-3-2001; Ord. No. 12-8, § I, 2-1-2012; Ord. No. 13-1, § I, 1-16-2013) 
Sec. 109-89. - Plat required.

(1)  The owner of a tract of land located within the corporate limits of Harlingen or within the five-mile extraterritorial jurisdiction that divides the tract in any manner that creates one or more lots of five acres or less must have a plat of the subdivision prepared or the owner of a tract that has been previously split and inadequately subdivided. 
(2)  A division of a tract is defined as any division regardless of whether it is made by using a metes and bounds description, or any description of less than a whole parcel, in a deed of conveyance or in a contract for a deed, using a contract of sale or other executory contract, lease/purchase agreement, or using any other method to convey property. 
(3)  The owner of a tract of land located inside the city limits of Harlingen or its extraterritorial jurisdiction who divides the tract into two or more parts to lay out a subdivision of the tract, including an addition, or to lay out suburban lots or building lots, or to lay out streets, alleys, squares, parks, or other parts of the tract intended to be dedicated to public use or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots fronting on or adjacent to the streets, alleys, squares, parks, or other parts must have a plat prepared. 
(4)  No subdivided land shall be sold or conveyed until the subdivider: 
a.  Has received approval of a final plat of the tract; and 
b.  Has filed and recorded a legally approved plat with the county clerk of the county in which the tract is located. 
(5)  These rules and any preceding rules shall apply to land that has been divided on or after November 1, 1978.

All costs associated with replatting shall be borne by the persons requesting the replat. 
(b)  Any public hearing on a proposed major amendment shall be limited to whether the proposed major amendment should or should not be approved. The planning and zoning commission shall approve or disapprove any proposed major amendment and may make any modifications in the terms and conditions of the preliminary plat approval reasonably related to the proposed amendment. If the applicant is unwilling to accept the proposed major amendment under the terms and conditions required by the planning and zoning commission, the applicant may withdraw the proposed major amendment. A major amendment shall include, but is not limited to, any amendment that results in or has the effect of decreasing open space in the subdivision by ten percent or more. 
(c)  An applicant may not propose more than two amendments, whether major or minor, to any preliminary plat.

Sec. 109-96. - Exemptions to platting requirements. 
(a)  Property that was divided into its current configuration prior to November 1, 1978, and has not had a change in boundaries since such time can be exempted from platting requirements if the owner can provide proof of such. A recorded property deed dated prior to that date with a metes and bounds or legal description exactly matching the current property holding can constitute necessary proof. 
(b)  Property that is divided into tracts larger than five acres where each part has public access and no public improvement is being dedicated may also be exempted from platting requirements. 
(c)  The director of planning and development shall determine the subdivision exemption status of a tract of land upon receipt of a completed application form (see section 109-230, Exhibit J) and accompanying documents by the property owner or authorized agent. The application form shall be accompanied by the following documents: 
(1)  Warranty deeds for the subject tracts indicating date of last conveyance; 
(2)  Evidence of a building on the subject tract prior to the effective date indicated above, if applicable; 
(3)  Current tax certificates;

(6)  Upon receipt of all applicable data and upon determination that such tract is exempt from subdivision, the director of planning and development can issue a letter of determination that the tract satisfies the exemption requirements of this section. 
(Code 1997, § 156.029; Ord. No. 01-01, § 3.9, 1-3-2001; Ord. No. 12-8, § I, 2-1-2012) 
Sec. 109-97. - Lot line adjustment. 
(a)  When a replat is not required. When any lot and a portion of a lot aggregating a larger tract in width and/or size than the average lot in the block in which same is situated are conveyed as a single unit for a single use purpose from previously legally platted subdivision, no replat thereof shall be required. 
(b)  Exceptions. 
(1)  This exception shall not apply to any extension across an easement or public way, nor permit changing the facing of the original lots. 
(2)  This exception is not to be construed as a waiver of any requirement of chapter 111, as amended, or other applicable ordinance or recorded covenant and restriction, and for such interpretations, the integrated tract shall thereafter be considered as a single lot.

Sec. 109-129. - Specifications. 
    Three sets of construction plans and profiles shall be submitted with the following information: 
(1)  Streets and alleys. All temporary facilities necessary to complete the job are the responsibility of the contractor. Any traffic control as required shall follow the most current version of the Texas Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. For details, see section 109-233, Exhibit M. 
a.  Site preparation and grading. 
1.  Protection of facilities. Existing utility lines (either overhead or underground), pavement and sidewalks designated on the drawings, shown to contractor or mentioned in the specifications, shall be kept free of damage from contractor's operations. If damaged, any utilities or pavement shall be restored at the contractor's expense. Any utility not known in time to prevent damage, and if inadvertently damaged during operations, the contractor shall notify the engineer and owner of said utility at once so that emergency repair may be made. Some valve boxes and manhole lids will require adjustment to ensure proper grades. 
2.  Excavation. 
(i)  Excavation of every description and of whatever material encountered within the grading limits of the project shall be performed to the lines and grades as shown on the drawings. Waste excavation shall be disposed of by the contractor. 
(ii)  During construction, excavation and filling shall be performed in a manner in sequence that will provide drainage at all times. 
(iii)  If the material of the subgrade for paved areas is of unstable character and unfit for foundation, the contractor shall make such additional excavation as the engineer may direct, and refill with approved material. 
3.  Subgrade preparation. 
(i)  The subgrade shall be shaped in conformity with the typical sections shown on the plans and to the lines and grades established by the engineer. All unstable or otherwise objectionable material shall be removed from the subgrade and replaced with approved material. All holes, ruts, and depressions shall be filled with approved material. The surface of the subgrade shall be finished to the lines and grades established, and be in conformity with the typical sections shown on the plans. Any deviation in excess of one-half inch in cross section and 16 feet in length measured longitudinally shall be corrected by loosening, adding, or removing sufficient subgrade and shall be prepared in advance to ensure satisfactory execution of the work. 
(ii)  Unless otherwise indicated on plans, the surface of the ground of all unpaved areas which are to receive embankment shall be loosened by scarifying or plowing to a depth of not less than six inches. The loosened material shall be recompacted with the new embankment as hereinafter specified. The embankment shall be placed in layers not to exceed six inches in thickness for the full width of the individual roadway cross section and in such lengths as are best suited to the sprinkling and compacted methods utilized. 
(iii)  Where embankments are to be placed adjacent to or over existing roadbeds, the roadbed slopes shall be plowed or scarified to a depth of not less than six inches and the embankment built up in successive layers, as hereinafter described, if height is increased. Then, if directed, the top of the old roadbed shall be scarified, and recompacted with next layer of new embankment. The total depth of the scarified and added material shall not exceed the permissible depth layer. 
(iv)  Except as otherwise required by the plans, all embankments shall be constructed in layers approximately parallel to the finished grade of the roadbed and unless otherwise specified each layer shall be so constructed as to provide a uniform slope of one-quarter inch per foot to drain. 
(v)  Subgrade materials shall be compacted by approved mechanical tamping equipment to an apparent dry density of the total material of not less than 95 percent of the maximum dry density as determined in accordance with THD Test Method Tex-114-E. Tests for density will be made within 24 hours after compacting operations are completed. If tests show the density to be less than the specified minimum or the moisture content to be more than three percent above or below the optimum, the course shall be reworked as necessary to obtain the specified compaction and moisture content. 
(vi)  Unsuitable excavation or excavation in excess of that needed for construction shall be known as waste and shall become the property of the contractor and it shall become his sole responsibility to dispose of this material in a manner approved by the engineer. 
4.  Protection of finish grading. 
(i)  During construction, embankment and excavation shall be kept shaped and drained. 
(ii)  Ditches and drains shall be maintained in such manner as to drain effectively at all times. Graded areas shall be protected against action of elements prior to acceptance of the work. Settlement or washing that may have occurred shall be repaired and grades shall be re-established to the required elevations and slopes. The contractor is required to maintain pumping equipment to remove all standing water after a rainfall event. No water shall remain standing longer than 12 hours after it has stopped raining. 
b.  Subgrade stabilization with lime. 
1.  Scope. 
(i)  This item shall consist of treating the subgrade, scarifying the area to be treated, the addition of lime, and mixing and compacting the mixed material to the required density. This item applies to natural ground and embankments, and shall be constructed as specified herein and in conformity with the typical section lines and grades as shown on the plans. 
(ii)  It is the primary requirement of this specification to secure a completed (lime stabilized subgrade) course of treated material containing a lime mixture, of uniform density and moisture content, well bound for its full depth and with a smooth surface for placing subsequent course. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to regulate the sequence of his work, to use the proper amount of lime, maintain the work and rework the courses as necessary to meet the above requirements. 
(iii)  Prior to the application of the lime slurry, the road bed shall be excavated to subgrade, shaped to conform to the typical sections, lines and grades as shown on the plans or as established by the engineer. The material, before lime is added, shall be scarified and/or excavated to the secondary grade (proposed bottom of the lime stabilized subgrade) and removed or windrowed to expose the secondary grade. Any wet or unstable materials below the secondary grade shall be corrected, as directed by the engineer, by scarifying, adding lime, and compacting until it is of uniform stability. 
(iv)  If the contractor elects to use a cutting and pulverizing machine that will remove the subgrade material at the same time, he will not be required to expose the secondary grade nor windrow the material. However, the contractor shall be required to roll the subgrade, as directed by the engineer, before using any of the pulverizing machines and correct any soft areas that this rolling may reveal. This method will be permitted only where a machine is provided which will ensure that the material is cut uniformly to the proper depth and which has cutters that will plane the secondary grade to a smooth surface over the entire width of the cut. The machine shall be of such design that a visible indication is given at all times that the machine is cutting to the proper depth. 
2.  Materials and equipment. 
(i)  Lime shall meet the following requirements for hydrated lime slurry. Hydrated lime shall consist of dry powder obtained by treating quick lime with enough water to satisfy its affinity for water under the conditions of its hydration. This material is to consist essentially of calcium hydroxide or a mixture of calcium hydroxide and a small allowable percentage of calcium oxide, magnesium oxide and magnesium hydroxide. The hydrated lime, when tested, shall conform to the following requirements for chemical composition: 
A.  Hydrate alkalinity, percent by weight CA(OH) minimum 90.0 percent. 
B.  Unhydrated lime content, percent by weight CaO maximum 5.0 percent. 
C.  The percent by weight of residue retained shall conform to the following requirements: 
(a)  Residue retained on No. 6 (3360-micron) sieve: none. 
(b)  Residue retained on No. 10 (2000-micron) sieve: maximum ten percent. 
(c)  Residue retained on No. 30 (590-micron) sieve: maximum 2.5 percent. 
D.  The above specifications apply specifically to the normal hydrate of lime made from "high-calcium" type limestone. Hydrated lime shall be applied as provided in these specifications by mixing with water to form a slurry. 
E.  The use of commercial lime slurry is acceptable under these specifications. The lime slurry shall be a pumpable suspension of solids in water. The water or liquid portion of the slurry shall not contain dissolved material in sufficient quantity and/or nature injurious or objectionable for the purpose intended. The solids portion of the mixture, when considered on the basis of solids content, shall consist principally of hydrated lime of a quantity and fineness sufficient to meet the following requirements: 
(a)  Chemical composition. The solids content of the lime slurry shall have a hydrate alkalinity Ca(OH) of not less than 90 percent by weight. 
(b)  Residue. The percent by weight of the residue in the solids content of the lime slurry shall conform to the requirements listed above for hydrated lime. The dry solids contents shall be at least 31 percent by weight of the slurry. 
(c)  Mixing water. Only water from city water mains shall be used. Contractor will make arrangements with the water department to obtain a meter and pay for water used. 
(ii)  Equipment. The machinery, tools and equipment necessary for proper execution of the work shall be on the project and approved by the inspector prior to the beginning of construction operations. 
A.  Hydrated lime shall be stored and handled in closed weatherproof containers until immediately prior to mixing with water to form a slurry consistency for application with the material to be stabilized. If storage bins are used they shall be completely closed. Hydrated lime in bags shall be stored in waterproof buildings with adequate protection from ground dampness. 
B.  If the lime is furnished in trucks, each truck shall have the weight of lime certified on public scales. 
C.  If the lime is furnished in bags, each bag shall bear the manufacturers certified weight. 
D.  Lime slurry machine. The use of a lime slurry machine (mixer) will be permitted. The lime slurry machine shall be capable of mixing and delivering an acceptable lime slurry suitable for use in the work, meeting all specification requirements. 
3.  Construction methods. 
(i)  Slurry placing. The required amount of lime, as shown on the plans, or as recommended by the materials engineering laboratory, at the city's option, shall be mixed with water in trucks with approved distributors and applied as a thin water suspension or slurry. The lime slurry (including commercial lime slurry) shall be applied with a lime percentage meeting the limits and requirements as set out above. The distribution of lime at the rates shown on the plans, as directed herein, and/or as directed by the engineer, shall be attained by successive passes over the measured section of roadway until the proper moisture and lime content has been secured. The distributor truck shall be equipped with an agitator that will keep the lime and water at a uniform consistent mixture. 
(ii)  Dry placing. 
A.  The lime shall be spread by an approved spreader or by bag distribution at the rates shown on the plans or as directed by the engineer. 
B.  The lime shall be distributed at a uniform rate and in such manner as to reduce the scattering of lime by wind conditions such that blowing lime does not become objectionable to traffic or adjacent property owners. A motor grader shall not be used to spread lime. 
C.  The material shall be sprinkled as directed by the engineer, until the proper moisture content has been secured. 
(iii)  First mixing. The material and lime shall be thoroughly mixed by approved road mixers or other approved equipment, and the mixing continued until, in the opinion of the inspector, a homogeneous friable mixture of material and lime is obtained, free from all clods or lumps. Materials containing plastic clays or other material which will not readily mix with lime shall be mixed as thoroughly as possible at the time of the lime application brought to the proper moisture content and left to cure for one to four days as directed by the inspector. During the curing period, the material shall be kept moist as directed. 
(iv)  Final mixing. 
A.  After the required curing time, the material shall be uniformly mixed by approved methods. If the solid binder lime mixture contains clods, they shall be reduced in size by raking, blading, discing, harrowing, scarifying or the use of other approved pulverizing methods so that when all nonslaking material retained on the No. 4 sieve are removed, the remainder of the material shall meet the following requirements when tested dry by laboratory sieves: 
Minimum Passing 13/4-inch Sieve: 100 percent. 
Minimum Passing No. 4 Sieve: 60 percent. 
B.  During the interval of time between application and mixing, hydrated lime that has been exposed to the open air for a period of six hours or more or to excessive loss due to washing or blowing will not be accepted. 
(v)  If the total thickness of the stabilized subgrade material to be treated cannot be mixed in one operation, the previously mixed material shall be bladed to a windrow just beyond the area to be treated and the next layer mixed with lime (slurry) as specified above. The first layer of the treated material shall be compacted in such a manner that the treated material will be mixed with the underlying material. 
(vi)  The lime slurry mixed material shall be sprinkled as necessary and rolled as directed by the inspector. All irregularities, depressions, or weak spots that develop in the grade shall be corrected immediately by scarifying the area affected, by adding or removing the material as required and reshaping and recompacting by sprinkling and rolling. The surface of the (subgrade) course shall be maintained in a smooth condition, free from undulations and ruts, until the base course and/or pavement is placed, or the work is otherwise accepted. 
(vii)  The stabilized subgrade course shall be sprinkled as required and compacted to an apparent dry density of not less than 95 percent of the dry density (standard density) of the samples of the stabilized materials as determined by the proctor compaction test (AASHO Designation: T99 and T-180 or ASTM Designation: D-698-70 and D-1557-70 with subsequent revisions). 
4.  Testing. 
(i)  The materials engineering laboratory will sample and evaluate the subgrade material in accordance with established criteria to determine the percent of hydrated lime (lime slurry form) that will be required and successfully used as chemical stabilizing agent to accomplish satisfactory work. These tests will include Atterburg limit determinations of the raw soil and evaluations of plasticity index and/or strength with varying amounts of lime required for the stabilizing additive. 
(ii)  The hydrate lime, in slurry form, mixtures will be sampled to establish the quality and compliances with the project plans and specifications. The moisture density relationship will be established in accordance with the specified procedures, AASHO Designation: T-99 and T-180 and/or ASTM Designation: D-698-70 and D-1557-70 with subsequent revisions. 
(iii)  The materials engineering laboratory will perform "in-place" the density and moisture tests of the "raw" or lime established subgrade soil to ensure that the required compaction is maintained during the construction operations. 
(iv)  The frequency for performing the tests shall be at least one moisture and density test for each 1,000 square yards of area. 
(v)  The testing shall be as outlined above. In addition to the requirements specified for density, the full depth of the stabilized material shown on the plans shall be compacted to the extent necessary to remain firm and stable under construction equipment. After the subgrade (section) is completed, tests as necessary will be made. If the material fails to meet the density requirements, it shall be reworked to meet these requirements. Throughout the entire operation the shape of the subgrade course shall be maintained by blading, and the surface upon completion shall be smooth and in conformity with typical section shown on the plans and to the established lines and grades. Should the material, due to any reason or cause, lose the required stability, density and finish before base or pavement is placed, it shall be reconstructed and refinished at the sole expense of the contractor. 
5.  Finishing, curing and preparation for base course. After the lime treated subgrade has been compacted, it shall be brought to the required lines and grades in accordance with the plan typical sections. The completed section shall then be finished by rolling as directed with a pneumatic tire roller or other suitable roller sufficiently light to prevent hairline cracking. The complete section shall be moisture-cured for a period of one to four days, or as directed by the engineer. In cases where the stabilized subgrade sets up sufficiently to prevent objectionable damage from traffic, such sections of the completed subgrade may be opened to traffic two days after completion. 
6.  Measurement. 
(i)  Lime stabilized subgrade of the depth indicated on the plans shall be measured by the square yards completed with lime and accepted in place, to neat lines as shown on the plan typical cross section. 
(ii)  Approved truck and/or vehicles delivering lime slurry on the job site shall surrender on request, to the inspector, a certified weight certificate for verification of the truck vehicle contents signed by the operator (public weigher) from a certified public truck scale. The weight of the lime slurry shall be calculated from the number of gallons of slurry applied to the subgrade material as directed by the engineer. The calculations shall be based on the percent of solids by weight of the lime in the slurry, as delivered and incorporated into the subgrade material. 
c.  Flexible base. 
1.  Materials. The material shall be crushed or uncrushed as necessary to meet the requirements hereinafter specified, and shall consist of durable stone or gravel, crushed and/or screened to the required particle size, with or without other approved fine sized materials.

(Code 1997, § 156.080; Ord. No. 07-28, 4-18-2007) 
Sec. 109-189. - Street paving. 
(a)  Oversize streets. When the city requires paving width in excess of 37 feet as may be required by the comprehensive plan or as otherwise may be required by the city for interior streets, the city shall pay for any portion of the street in excess of 37 feet. The subdivider shall pay for installation of curb and gutter, where applicable. 
(b)  Interior streets. The subdivider shall pay 100 percent of the costs of installing interior streets, including curb and gutter, for a street width not to exceed 37 feet (local street standard). The right-of-way shall be dedicated in accordance with the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Perimeter streets. To provide for safe and orderly two-way vehicular travel on streets accessing new subdivisions, perimeter streets that do not meet the current city standard (or are deficient) shall be subject to one of the following options, at the discretion of the developer: 
(1)  Improve the subject perimeter streets to a minimum of 22 feet of pavement width; this width has been determined by the city to be the minimum width that will allow for safe and orderly two-way vehicular travel regardless of the level of traffic impact the proposed subdivision has on the perimeter streets. 
a.  For subdivisions in the city limits or within an approved three-year annexation plan, the perimeter street improvements described above shall be constructed to the city's standards and situated and designed in a manner that will permit the remaining pavement to be added at a future date. Streets constructed pursuant to this article may be constructed without curb and gutter if, and only if, any alternative method of street drainage (such as culverts and/or drainage channels) approved by the city engineer is constructed as part of the street improvements. 
b.  Subdivisions outside of the city limits, within the city's ETJ, and not on a three-year annexation plan, may improve said perimeter streets to the standards for a minor residential street as outlined in the Cameron County Subdivision Regulations. 
(2)  In lieu of subsection (c)(1) of this section, the rough proportionality provision described in section 109-192 shall be applied to the deficient perimeter streets. Said rough proportionality standard shall be applied as if the deficient perimeter street were to be improved/reconstructed to the standard as outlined in the city's long range thoroughfare plan. 
This section does not require subdividers to construct and/or improve perimeter streets maintained by the State of Texas (TxDOT); however, the right-of-way for such street shall be dedicated in accordance with the provisions set forth in section 109-124. 
(d)  Special fund. 
(1)  There is hereby established a special escrow account for the deposit of each sum paid for future street improvements under this article, which shall be known as the street escrow account. 
(2)  The city shall account for all sums paid under this section with reference to individual plats involved and the perimeter street on which it has frontage. The city must expend any funds paid for such purposes within ten years from the date received by the city for overlay, additional right-of-way acquisition or construction of improved road and/or curb and gutter. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis. If not so expended, the owners of the property on the last day of such period shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of such sum computed on the same basis as is called for in subsection (c) of this section. No interest shall be paid on such sums. The owners of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing to the finance director of the city, or such right shall be forfeited. 
(Code 1997, § 156.081; Ord. No. 01-01, § 6.1, 1-3-2001; Ord. No. 07-28, 4-18-2007) 
Sec. 109-190. - Drainage. 
(a)  Oversizing of drainage facilities. When the city determines it is necessary to oversize facilities for the orderly development of the area drainage system, the city will participate in the cost of such oversized pipe or facilities provided funds are available for this purpose. The subdivider whose pipes or facilities will be oversized will be referred to as the initial subdivider. Should the city participate in oversizing, the city shall recover its cost from future connections made onto the storm drainage system and the initial subdivider shall recover from future connections that portion of their expense that will equalize the cost of drainage to the initial subdivider equivalent to all others who will be connecting to the oversized systems. 
(b)  Cost recovery. Should the city on its own initiative install a drainage system to serve a particular area of the city, the city shall recover its cost from future connections made on to the storm drainage system. The subdivider shall bear all costs, including, but not limited to, labor and materials required to make connections to the storm drainage system. Reimbursement to the city, and, when applicable, to the initial subdivider, shall be the pro rata cost per acre of that portion of the oversized system necessary to accommodate the number of acres in the subdivision making connection to the oversized system, plus eight percent per annum interest from the date of installation of the oversized drainage system. The pro rata cost per acre of the subdivision shall be calculated by the city engineer or the director of public works of the city. 
(c)  Special drainage districts established. 
(1)  In the following areas of the city, drainage improvements have been made and subdividers dividing land in such areas will be responsible for payment of their pro rata share of the cost prior to recordation of the final plat. 
(2)  V-Line ditch. Drainage fees for the "V-Line" relief drain ditch shall be as found in the city fee schedule in chapter 18. 
* Note all payments are payable on gross acreage of property to be developed. 
(3)  Sections indicated on the table refer to the map below. 

(Code 1997, § 156.082; Ord. No. 01-01, § 6.2, 1-3-2001; Ord. No. 01-33, 4-18-2001) 
Sec. 109-191. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  Where road reconstruction is imminent or developer would prefer to complete building construction prior to sidewalk construction, the amount of sidewalk improvement may be put into a special escrow account similar to the procedure with road assessments. 
(b)  The amount paid shall be as set forth in subsection (c) of this section and shall be placed in a special escrow fund to remain earmarked for sidewalk improvements on the subdivision road where deposited for a minimum time period of ten years (unless used to make improvements sooner). 
(c)  The amount to be paid is calculated by the city public works/engineering department based on the standard cost of sidewalk development from their most recent bids. This amount will be recalculated annually and changed as necessary. 
(Code 1997, § 156.083; Ord. No. 01-01, § 6.3, 1-3-2001) 
Sec. 109-192. - Rough proportionality. 
(a)  In accordance with Texas Local Government Code § 212.904 (apportionment of municipal infrastructure costs), no development improvements required by this article may be imposed on a developer as a condition for approval of a proposed development project unless the improvements: 
(1)  Are related to the needs created by the proposed development project; and 
(2)  Are roughly proportionate to the impact of the proposed development project, as approved by a professional engineer licensed to practice in Texas and retained by the city (city engineer). 
(b)  Developer's report. The developer shall submit a report prepared by a professional engineer licensed to practice in Texas to the city engineer. The report must include the following information: 
(1)  An analysis of existing infrastructure capacity and condition in the area including, as applicable, streets (width of right-of-way and pavement), alleys, street lighting, street signals, fire hydrants, and stormwater drainage system; 
(2)  An analysis of the need for infrastructure additions or improvements created by the proposed development project; 
(3)  A determination of the improvements that are related to the needs created by the proposed development project and roughly proportionate to the impact of the proposed development project; and 
(4)  Any other information that may be required by the city engineer in determining the accuracy of the developer's report. 
(c)  City study. The city engineer shall prepare a report that reflects the accuracy of the developer's report. 
(d)  Illustrative example of rough proportionality for a deficient perimeter street. A proposed subdivision has an adjacent perimeter street with an existing pavement width of 18 feet, and is shown on the city's thoroughfare plan as a collector street. Collector streets require a pavement width of at least 48 feet, and, pursuant to the comprehensive plan, as amended, have a capacity of 15,000 vehicle trips a day. A study produced by the developer and approved by the city engineer shows that the proposed subdivision development will generate 1,500 vehicle trips per day, or roughly ten percent of the capacity, on to the perimeter collector street. Hence, the developer shall pay an amount into escrow that equals ten percent of the cost of constructing/reconstructing the perimeter street to the city's standard and a width of 48 feet. 
(e)  Rough proportionality appeal. 
(1)  An appeal to the city commission under this section may be filed by a property owner of the applicant for the subject plat in which a requirement for a development improvement has been applied or attached as a condition of approval, or as grounds for denying the plat application. The applicant must file a written appeal with the city and submit copies of a study prepared by a registered professional engineer demonstrating that the additional development improvements are: 
a.  Not in accordance with this subdivision chapter; and/or 
b.  Not proportionate to the demand created by the development on the city's public facilities systems, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed. 
(2)  After holding and considering evidence from both the applicant and the city engineer, the city commission may: 
a.  Deny the appeal, effectively imposing the development improvement; 
b.  Grant the appeal and waive in whole or in part the development improvement as necessary to achieve proportionality; or 
c.  Grant the appeal and direct that the city shall participate in the costs of the development improvement. 
(3)  An applicant may appeal the decision of the city commission under this section to the appropriate county or district court within 30 days of the final determination by the city commission.

Sec. 111-62. - Use chart; allowable uses by zone. 
    This section contains a chart of permissible land uses by zone. If you want to open a specific type of business look for that use in the uses listed in the left hand column. Once the use is located, follow the line across to the right to determine which zoning designations it is allowed in by right (designated by an "x"), which it is allowed in with a special use permit (designated by an "s"), or if it is not allowed in a zone (no mark present). If you do not find your use listed, check with the department of planning and development, it may be under a general classification category. Similarly, if you own a piece of property and you know what it is zoned, you can determine what uses are allowed by following the column under your zoning category (e.g. R-1, M-2, MH. . .) to determine which uses are allowed by right or with a special use permit.

Sec. 111-63. - Circuses, carnivals and amusements. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Carnival means a transient or traveling show temporarily erected for the amusement of those attending, normally consisting of mechanical rides, and normally, but not necessarily, including a combination of two or more of the following attractions: a ferris wheel; a side show; a mechanical merry-go-round; a roller coaster; a game of skill with prizes awarded to winners. 
    Circus means a transient or traveling show performed for the amusement of those attending, featuring shows by performers, normally including, but not limited to, clowns, acrobats, jugglers, trapeze artists and trained animals. Any circus in combination with a carnival or containing the attractions as set forth in the definition of a carnival above shall be considered a carnival for the purposes of this chapter and not a circus. 
    Permanent amusement park means a permanent place of entertainment containing permanent buildings, permanent and temporary attractions normally associated with carnivals and located within an enclosed area. Such enclosed area may be enclosed by surrounding buildings, or a fence at least 75 percent of which will be a permanent screening fence of masonry or solid redwood or cedar, no less than six feet in height, with the remaining 25 percent of such fence to be of chainlink type, no less than six feet in height. 
    Residential structure means a single-family residence, duplex, multifamily residence or mobile home occupied as a residence whether or not zoned for that purpose. 
    School/church carnival means a carnival as defined in this subsection, but sponsored and conducted by and exclusively controlled by the public, private, or parochial schools or churches of the city, staffed by teachers and students (or their parents) and operated on the grounds of the school or church involved. Said carnival may consist of a transient or traveling show or be totally originating locally. (These carnivals shall be exempt from the provisions set forth in this article.) 
    Temporary amusement show or religious activity means a show other than a carnival or a circus, such as a transient or temporary skating rink or temporary religious revival or service, petting zoo, rock concert or other outdoor musical concert performed by a transient or traveling musical group or band; to be held for a limited time with a fixed or anticipated termination date, whether conducted in a tent structure, rented building, storage building, or an open air space. 
(b)  Carnivals, circuses, religious activities or temporary amusements; location restrictions. 
(1)  Carnivals, circuses, religious activities or temporary amusements are allowed only in the following zoned areas of the city: 
a.  General Retail (GR); 
b.  Light Industry (LI); 
c.  Heavy Industry (HI); or 
d.  Not Designated (N). 
(2)  An event may be operated on city owned land under whatever limitations or regulations the city shall impose. These limitations shall be determined individually or on a case by case basis with nothing herein set forth to be construed as requiring the city to make available to any event such city owned property, whether open air or enclosed. 
(3)  No portion of such event shall be set up, located, and/or operated within 300 feet of any private residential structure located in a residentially zoned district (R-1, R-2, M-1, M-2, MH) as defined in this article. The city commission may, after a public hearing, make exception to this location restriction where good cause exists, but shall not be bound to do so. 
(c)  Parking. 
(1)  Carnivals. Fifteen off-street parking spaces must be provided for each mechanical ride contiguous to the grounds where the carnival is operated. 
(2)  Circuses. One off-street parking place must be provided for each four seats available to view circus acts contiguous to the grounds on which the circus is operated. 
(3)  Religious activities or other temporary amusements. One off-street parking place must be provided for each four seats of seating available or for each 400 square feet of activity area, whichever is greater, contiguous to the grounds on which the event is located. 
(d)  Permanent amusement parks. 
(1)  Permanent amusement parks in the city shall be prohibited except in the area zoned general retail, light industry, heavy industry. 
(2)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as an exemption from compliance by such permanent amusement park with any other subdivision requirements, zoning requirements, housing code, building code, or other ordinances of the city, which shall be complied with prior to the utilization of such permanent amusement park by the general public. 
(Code 1997, §§ 112.01, 112.05, 112.06, 112.11(A), (D); Ord. No. 04-20, 4-7-2004) 
Sec. 111-64. - Drilling for hydrocarbons or other minerals restricted. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, individual, partnership, or other legal entity to engage in or permit drilling for the purpose of exploring for, discovering, producing, or injecting hydrocarbons or other minerals on any property within the city, with the exception of property zoned light industry and heavy industry under this article. Any drilling for such purposes shall be unlawful at any location nearer than 400 feet from any residence, commercial building, or other permanent structure intended for human occupancy.

ARTICLE IV. - BUILDING SITES 

Sec. 111-87. - Creation of building site. 
    No permit for the construction of a building upon any tract or plot shall be issued until a building site, building tract or building lot has been created by compliance with one of the following conditions: 
(1)  The lot or tract is part of a plat of record properly approved by the planning and zoning commission and filed in the Plat Records, Cameron County, Texas. 
(2)  The site plot or tract is all or part of a site plan officially approved by the planning and zoning commission, which site plan provides all utility and drainage easements, alleys, streets and other public improvements necessary to meet the normal requirements for platting, including designation of building areas, and such easements, alleys and streets have been acquired and property dedicated and the necessary public improvements provided. 
(3)  The plot, tract or lot faces upon a dedicated street and was separately owned prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which chapter 109 is derived (October 18, 1978). In this event, a building permit for only one main building may be issued on each such original separately owned parcel without first complying with either subsection (1) or (2) of this section.

Sec. 111-241. - Purpose and objectives. 
(a)  It is the intent of this section to establish minimum standards for the provision, installation, protection and maintenance of landscape materials in new nonresidential developments in order to promote the orderly, safe and environmentally sound development of land located within the corporate limits thereby promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the community. It is also aimed at achieving goals and objectives in the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  The regulations contained herein are necessary to enhance the community's aesthetic, environmental and economic structures. The importance of preserving and improving the natural environment and maintaining a working ecological balance is of increasing concern. The use of landscape elements can effectively contribute to the processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration, water absorption and noise, glare and heat abatement, as well as the preservation of the community's aesthetic qualities. 
(c)  It is also recognized that it is possible to realize numerous beneficial effects of landscaping, including the following: 
(1)  Landscaping can minimize demands on the city storm sewer system by preserving natural drainage. 
(2)  The improvement of air and water quality is achieved through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake. 
(3)  The use of trees and other plants reduces erosion by the binding of soil particles with their roots, thus holding the soil together against the effects of wind and water. 
(4)  Vegetation reduces and/or reverses air, noise, heat and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation. 
(5)  Landscaping reduces hot air temperatures caused by paved surfaces and automobiles through the process of transpiration associated with green material. Vegetation also helps promote energy conservation through the creation of shade, reducing heat gain in, or on, buildings and paved areas. 
(6)  Landscaping provides visual buffering and beautifies the appearance of setback and parking areas within the city. 
(7)  The use of landscaping also enhances the safety of parking lots by guiding the circulation of cars and people and by ensuring that the driver's vision is unobstructed. 
(8)  Preservation of landscaping protects, preserves and increases the value of property. 
(9)  The use of landscaping helps create natural habitat that supports eco-tourism. 
(Code 1997, § 159.085; Ord. No. 01-50, 6-20-2001; Ord. No. 11-63, § I, 12-27-2011)

(b)  All developed property in such districts which do not comply with the provisions of this section on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be considered nonconforming and shall be allowed to continue to operate until such time as a building permit is sought to reconstruct or enlarge a structure on such property to an extent exceeding 60 percent of the current replacement cost of such structure. At that time, the provisions of this section shall apply, and said areas shall be brought into compliance. Such structures may be exempt when remodeling, if the exterior walls of the building remain the same. 
(c)  Any nonresidential property on which one or more protected trees (as defined below) are located shall be subject to a tree removal permit prior to removal of such tree whether or not a building permit is being sought. 
(Code 1997, § 159.086; Ord. No. 01-50, 6-20-2001; Ord. No. 11-63, § I, 12-27-2011)

1.  Ten percent of gross building site area. 
2.  At least 70 percent of the landscaping requirement shall be located in the front or side yards of the site. (Exception: in the downtown improvement district, developers are encouraged to place buildings at the front property line to enhance pedestrian flow. Therefore, in these districts all plant materials will be allowed in the side or rear yard.) 
b.  Multifamily areas: 15 percent of gross building site. 
c.  Planned developments: The landscaping required by this article may be modified during the site plan review process for areas zoned planned development district according to specific design constraints of the site; provided, however, that the general spirit and intent of these regulations be observed. 
d.  Right-of-way: Remaining road rights-of-way may be landscaped for a credit not to exceed 25 percent of the right-of-way area landscaped. Said credit will be applied toward the total required site landscaping. 
(3)  Plant materials. 
a.  Plant materials used in conformance with provisions of this article may include, but are not limited to, the following: grass, shrubs, vines, hedges and trees.

(Code 1997, § 159.085; Ord. No. 02-09, 1-19-2002; Ord. No. 08-32, 4-16-2008; Ord. No. 09-13, 5-6-2009; Ord. No. 2010-20, 6-2-2010; Ord. No. 11-63, § I, 12-27-2011) 
Sec. 111-277. - Height, area and distance requirements and restrictions. 
(a)  Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from the base of the sign at the roadbed grade (or the surface grade beneath the sign if not flush with the ground) to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Along elevated expressway sections, the height shall be measured from the centerline of the main traveled way (see Figure 1).

^ Within 600 feet of Expressway 77/83, Expressway 83 or Future Interstate 1-69, maximum on-premises sign height is 80 feet and maximum off-premises sign height is 42.5 feet (Distances are measured along public rights-of-way at 90 degree angles). 
(b)  Area. 
(1)  Individual signs. The area of a sign face shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. This does not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets chapter regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself (see example below). 

(2)  Multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any given point. When two sign faces are placed back to back, so that only one face can be seen by approaching traffic at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. 
(3)  Total permitted sign area. The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a premises shall be computed by adding the area of each individual sign. Total sign area permitted is based on linear foot building frontage on either a street or access easement as defined in the table in subsection (b)(6) of this section. Lots fronting on either two or more streets, or access easements are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street or access easement may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot frontage on that street. In addition, multiple lots may pool together their frontages to allow for a larger shared sign at an appropriate location. 
(4)  Painted signs. Lettering painted on buildings will require a permit and will be counted toward maximum sign area allowed. 
(5)  Placement. No sign shall obstruct traffic or violate the sight triangle visibility as defined in section 111-581. No sign with a commercial message shall be placed in the right-of-way without first obtaining a license to encroach. 
(6)  Existing multi-tenant and/or retail/shopping centers in "GR" zones. Such centers in existence on June 2, 2010, shall follow the total permitted sign area requirements of this section, except as follows: 
a.  New tenants in a tenant space with no existing signage (from a previous tenant) shall be allowed a minimum of 32 square feet of signage on said tenant space, regardless of the total permitted sign area calculation for the center; 
b.  New tenants in a tenant space with existing defunct signage shall be allowed to replace said defunct sign with no more sign area than that of the defunct sign, unless an increase would be allowed under the total permitted sign area for the center; and/or 
c.  New tenants in the anchor tenant space shall be allowed signage under the total permitted sign area calculation for the center, or a no more than a 30 percent increase in sign area on the anchor tenant space from that of the previous anchor tenant, whichever is greater. The latter option (30 percent) shall be allowed on one occasion only (i.e., if the 30 percent option is used by a new anchor tenant, future anchor tenants in the same space may not repeat the option).

**** Commercial use in a LI District is allowed 3.0 square feet per linear foot of building facing either a street or access easement. 
# May be less, subject to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section. 
(c)  Lighting. Signs may be illuminated subject to the following restrictions: 
(1)  No revolving or rotating beam or beacon of light that simulates any emergency light or traffic device shall be permitted as part of any sign. Flashing devices shall not be permitted upon a sign; however, illuminated signs that indicate customary public information, such as time, date, temperature or other similar information, shall be permitted. 
(2)  External lighting, such as floodlights, thin line and goose neck reflectors, are permitted, provided the light source is directed on the face of the sign and is effectively shielded so as to prevent beams or rays of light or glare or other unsafe conditions from being directed into any portion of the traveled roadway. 
(3)  The illumination of any sign within 200 feet of a residential lot line shall be diffused or indirect in design to prevent direct rays of light from shining into adjoining residential districts or lots.

(4)  Off-premises signs having a face area ranging from 100 to 242 square feet shall not be erected within 1,000 feet of another off-premises sign on the same street. Signs within this range of size are allowable only on streets designated by the comprehensive plan thoroughfare map as a major arterial, minor arterial or collector. 
(5)  Off-premises signs having a face area of less than 100 square feet shall not be erected within 500 feet of another off-premises sign on the same street. 
(6)  Signs are not in violation of this section because of their proximity to one another if they are located so that their messages are directed toward traffic flowing in different directions, but in no case may be within 650 radial feet of another sign. 
(7)  Bench signs with advertising shall not be used in the calculation of distances between off-premises signs due to specific placement requirements usually affixed to bench signs. 
(8)  No sign shall be located in such a manner as to obscure or otherwise physically interfere with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, signal or device, or interfere with a driver's view of approaching or intersecting traffic. 
(9)  No off-premises signs shall be allowed within 500 feet from any church, synagogue, cemetery, preschool, school, college, public park, public playground or designated scenic area except political signs 36 square feet or less. 
(10)  New off-premises signs will not be allowed: 
a.  Within or oriented towards and readable from the neighborhood revitalization strategy area. (See Figure 3.) 

b.  Within the area bounded by U.S. Highway 77/83 to the west and southwest, and S.H. Loop 499 to the southeast, east, and north, unless the sign is a directional sign no larger than 20 square feet and not located within one-half mile of another off-premises directional sign. Existing signs within this area may be relocated within this area, however the maximum area of the relocated sign is that of the sign at its previous location or 50-square feet, whichever is less. 
c.  Oriented towards and readable from S.H. Loop 499, unless as allowed in subsection (d)(10)b of this section. Existing signs within this area may be relocated within this area, however, the maximum area of the relocated sign is that of the sign at its previous location or 50-square feet, whichever is less. 
(11)  Off-premises signs are not allowed on tracts of land not platted in accordance with chapter 109. 
(12)  Off-premises signs shall only be freestanding and shall not be placed on or through buildings or roofs. 
(13)  The total sign area of all off-premises signs on a developed lot or tract cannot exceed the maximum on-premises sign area otherwise allowed on that particular developed lot or tract. 
(14)  Off-premises animated signs shall comply with the following additional regulations: 
a.  Sign permits for such signs shall only be issued for the conversion of existing off-premises signs to animated signs, subject to the other provisions of this section. Off-premises signs in areas described in subsection (d)(10) of this section, shall not be converted to animated signs. 
b.  The dwell time, defined as the interval of change between each individual static message, shall be at least eight seconds, and a change of message must be accomplished within one second or less. The dwell time shall not include the one second or less required to change a message. 
c.  The sign shall contain a default mechanism that will freeze the sign in one position if a malfunction occurs. 
d.  The sign must contain a dimmer control and a photocell which automatically adjusts the display's intensity according to natural ambient light conditions. In addition, the sign may not display light of such intensity or brilliance to cause glare or otherwise impair the vision of the driver, or results in a nuisance to the driver. 
e.  The sign shall not be configured to resemble a warning or danger signal or cause the driver to mistake the sign for such.

ARTICLE XIII. - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 

Sec. 111-357. - Criteria for nonconforming status. 
    A nonconforming status shall exist under the following provisions: 
(1)  When a use or structure which does not conform to the regulations prescribed in the district in which such use or structure is located was in existence and lawfully operating prior to November 20, 1974, and has been operating since without discontinuance. 
(2)  When, on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the use or structure was in existence and lawfully constructed, located and operating in accordance with the provisions of the prior zoning ordinance or which was a nonconforming use thereunder, and which use or structure does not now conform to the regulations herein prescribed for the district in which such use or structure is located. 
(3)  When a use or structure which does not conform to the regulations prescribed in the district in which such use or structure is located was in existence at the time of annexation to the City of Harlingen and has since been in regular and continuous use. 
(Code 1997, § 159.130; Ord. No. 74-36, 11-20-1974; Ord. of 10-20-1993; Ord. No. 97-35, 7-2-1997; Ord. No. 14-33, § I, 9-3-2014) 
Sec. 111-358. - Continuation or discontinuation of a nonconforming use. 
(a)  Any nonconforming use of land or structures may be continued for definite periods of time subject to such regulations as the board of adjustments may require for immediate preservation of the adjoining property prior to the ultimate removal of the nonconforming use. The chief building official may grant a change of occupancy from one nonconforming use to another, providing the use is within the same, or higher, or more restrictive classification as the original nonconforming use. In the event a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of more restrictive classification, it shall not later be changed to a less restrictive classification of use and the prior less restrictive classification shall be considered to have been abandoned. 
(b)  If a structure occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by fire, the elements or other cause, it may not be rebuilt except to conform to the provisions of this article. In case of partial destruction of a nonconforming use not exceeding 75 percent of its current fair market value, reconstruction will be permitted but the size or function of the nonconforming use cannot be expanded. 
(c)  When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 90 days, or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then the property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the pre-existing use. However, a similar type of use in an existing vacant building that is using the same footprint that existed prior to the last approved occupancy, shall be permitted to operate with the existing parking. 
(d)  All of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 90 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent the apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. 
(e)  When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this article is vacant or discontinued on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the 90-day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.

ARTICLE XV. - SPECIAL USE PERMITS 

Sec. 111-413. - Special use permit process. 
    The city commission, after public hearing and proper notice to all property owners within 200 feet of the property involved, and after recommendations by the planning and zoning commission, may authorize the issuance of special or qualified use permits. The planning and development director shall waive the public hearing process for a special use permit application for a portable building and/or storage building as indicated in section 111-62 if certain conditions are met. The application shall be administratively approved when no written complaints have been filed by any person with the planning and development department within ten days from the date of publication of notice in the local newspaper of record and the mailing of the notice to all property owners within 200 feet of the site in question. If a written complaint has been filed with the planning and development department concerning a permit for a portable building and/or storage building, the permit shall be processed as an original application in compliance with this section. 
(1)  The planning and zoning commission, in considering and determining its recommendation to the city commission on any request for a special use permit under section 111-62, may require from the applicant, plans information, operating data and expert evaluation concerning the location, function, and characteristics of any building or use proposed, and shall require a site plan for a special use permit. The city commission may in the best interest of the public welfare and to ensure compliance with this chapter, establish conditions of operation, location, arrangement and authorizing the location of any of the uses listed as special use permits under sections 111-327 through 111-331. The city commission may impose such development standards and safeguards necessary for the protection of adjacent property and occupants thereof from excessive noise, vibration, dust, dirt, smoke, fumes, gas, odor, explosion, glare, offensive view, or other undesirable or hazardous conditions. If the planning and zoning commission recommends denial of a special use permit request, the items will not be carried forward to the city commission unless the decision is appealed following procedures referenced in section 111-31(h). 
(2)  Any use permit recommended by the planning and zoning commission and issued by the city commission may be qualified as described in subsection (a) of this section. 
(3)  The use permit issued by the city commission shall be deemed an amendment to chapter 111, and the development shall be in keeping with the plans and specifications and other data submitted to the planning and zoning commission and the city commission for the purpose of securing such use permit. 
(4)  Deviation or departure from the special use permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and shall void such special use permit. 
(5)  The city commission shall approve or deny an application for a special or qualified use permit within six months of the filing of a properly completed application. 
(6)  Special and qualified used permits granted after June 20, 1990, shall be personal to the grantee and shall be transferred only by cancellation of the existing permit and issuance of a new permit. However, special and qualified use permits granted or uses where an "s" appears under any one or more the "residence" classifications in section 111-62 shall run with the land for all classifications including nonresidence ones. 
(7)  If the business for which a special use permit was granted ceases operation for a continuous period of three months or more, such permit shall automatically lapse. However, a special and qualified use permit granted for a use where an "s" appears under any one or more of the "residence" classifications in section 111-62 shall run with the land for all classifications including nonresidence ones. Furthermore, the planning and zoning commission and city commission may grant a special use permit that may run with the land rather than the owner if the use was built specifically for one purpose and could not be used otherwise without major renovations (e.g., residential garden homes in an R-1 zone or an established business which was built for a particular use which will not change). 
(8)  The decision by the city commission regarding the denial, suspension or revocation of a special or qualified use permit is final. 
(9)  The placement of a portable building on the site prior to the issuance of a special use permit shall result in doubling the special use permit fee as established in the city fee schedule in chapter 18 plus provisions for a repeat offender to be subject to court citation with a maximum possible fine as established in the city fee schedule in chapter 18.

Sec. 111-414. - Special use permit for sexually oriented businesses. 
    The process for this type of special use permit is exactly the same as described above for any special use permit with the exception that there is a bi-annual renewal requirement for businesses conducting a sexually oriented business under a special use permit. As specified in section 4-3, no person or other entity shall sell any alcoholic beverages or operate a business for the sale of any alcoholic beverage, within 300 feet of any church, public school, or public hospital. The measurement of the aforesaid 300 foot distance shall be along the property lines of the street fronts and from front door to front door and in direct line across intersections, where they occur. This bi-annual review is to ensure that the business maintains a standard of conduct in accordance with public health, safety, welfare and morals. Any citizen who wishes to file a complaint against an establishment of this nature may do so with the police department at any time. When a permit is up for renewal, staff will check with the police department for any such complaints. If the establishment has excessive complaints as determined by the planning and zoning commission and city commission, it will be reason enough to deny a renewal of such permit. 
(1)  Location. In no event shall any sexually oriented business be located within a 1,500 foot radius of a school, church, hospital, day nursery, or kindergarten school, park, residentially zoned area or another sexually oriented business measured from the nearest property line of a property developed with a sexually oriented business to the nearest property line of a school, church, hospital, day nursery or kindergarten school, park, residentially zoned area or another sexually oriented business. 
(2)  Application. No special use permit shall be approved unless a sexually oriented business special use permit application has been completed and turned in prior to the deadline date for the applicable planning and zoning commission meeting. In addition, a background check will be run on the applicant. If an applicant fails to provide all requested information or supplies false, fraudulent, or untruthful information on the application this shall be just cause to deny the permit. 
(3)  Regulations for exhibition of sexually explicit films or videos. A person who operates a sexually oriented business, other than an adult motel, which exhibits on the premises in a viewing room of less than 150 square feet of floor space a sexually explicit film, videocassette or other video reproduction shall comply with the following requirements: 
a.  The application for a sexually oriented business special use permit shall be accompanied by a diagram of the premises showing a plan thereof specifying the location of one or more manager's stations and the location of all overhead lighting fixtures and designating any portion of the premises in which patrons will not be permitted. A manager's station may not exceed 32 square feet of floor area. The diagram shall also designate the place at which the permit will be conspicuously posted, if granted. A professionally prepared diagram in the nature of an engineer's or architect's blueprint shall not be required; however, each diagram should be oriented to the north or to some designated street or object and should be drawn to a designated scale or with marked dimensions sufficient to show the various internal dimensions of all areas of the interior of the premises to an accuracy of plus or minus six inches. 
b.  No alteration in the configuration or location of a manager's station may be made without the prior approval of the chief of police. 
c.  It is the duty of the applicant/licensee, the owners, the partial owners and their agents and employees at the premises to ensure that at least one employee is on duty and situated in each manager's station at all times that any patron is present inside the premises.

Restrooms may not contain video reproduction equipment. If the premises has two or more manager's stations designated, then the interior of the premises shall be configured in such a manner that there is an unobstructed view of each area of the premises to which any patron is permitted access for any purpose from at least one of the managers' stations. The view required in this division must be by direct line of sight from the manager's station. 
e.  It shall be the duty of the applicant/licensee, owners, the partial owners, and it shall also be the duty of any agents and employees present in the premises to ensure that the view area specified in subsection (3)d of this section remains unobstructed by any doors, walls, merchandise, display racks or other materials at all times that any patron is present in the premises and to ensure that no patron is permitted access to any area of the premises which has been designated as an area in which patrons will not be permitted in the diagram filed pursuant to subsection (3)a of this section. 
f.  The premises shall be equipped with overhead lighting fixtures of sufficient intensity to illuminate every place to which patrons are permitted access at an illumination of not less than one footcandle as measured at the floor level. 
g.  It shall be the duty of the applicant/licensee, the owners, partial owners and operators and it shall also be the duty of any agents and employees present in the premises to ensure that the illumination described above, is maintained at all times that any patron is present in the premises. 
(4)  Denial of application for certain offenses. A sexually oriented business special use permit application shall be denied if an applicant or an owner or partial owner has been convicted of a crime: 
a.  Involving a violation of Texas Penal Code ch. 21 (other than section 21.06) or 43, or Texas Penal Code § 22.011, 22.021, 25.02, 25.06 or 25.07, together with future amendments thereof, or corresponding laws of other state or federal governments or criminal attempt, conspiracy or solicitation to commit any of the foregoing offenses.

c.  The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the disqualification of the applicant or the partial owner. 
(5)  Suspension. The chief of police shall suspend a sexually oriented business special use permit for a period not to exceed 30 days if he determines that an applicant/licensee, owner, partial owner, or employee of an applicant/licensee has: 
a.  Violated any of the items mentioned in this subsection or violated subsection (4) of this section.

Sec. 111-443. - Authority of board. 
(a)  The zoning board of adjustments may: 
(1)  Hear and decide the following special exceptions to the terms of a zoning ordinance: 
a.  The reconstruction, extension, or enlargement of a building occupied by nonconforming use on the lot or tract occupied by such building, provided such reconstruction does not prevent the return of such property to a conforming use. 
b.  Modifications to the height, yard, area, coverage and parking regulations as may be necessary to secure appropriate development of a parcel of land which differs from other parcels in the district by being of such restricted area, shape, or slope that it cannot be appropriately developed without such modifications. 
c.  The discontinuance of nonconforming uses of land or structures under any plan whereby the full value of the structures and facilities can be amortized within a definite period of time, taking into consideration the general character of the neighborhood and the necessity for all property to conform to the regulations of this chapter. All actions to discontinue a nonconforming use of land or structure shall be taken with due regard for the property rights of the persons affected when considered in a light of the public welfare and the character of the area surrounding the designated nonconforming use and the conservation and preservation of property. The board shall from time to time on its own motion or upon cause presented by interested property owners inquire into the existence, continuation or maintenance of any nonconforming use within the city. 
(2)  Authorize in specific cases a variance from the terms of a zoning ordinance if the variance is not contrary to the public interest and, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed and substantial justice done. 
a.  No variance requests will be accepted or approved for height exceptions within the airport overlay zones as established in section 111-532(b)(2) and (b)(3).

The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
b.  Appeal proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed, otherwise, than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
c.  Public notice of appeal. The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal, and give public notice of the hearing and due notice to the parties in interest. A party may appear at the hearing in person or by agent or by attorney.

(3)  An officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality. 
(b)  The petition must be presented within ten days after the date the decision is filed in the board's office. 
(c)  On the presentation of the petition, the court may grant a writ of certiorari directed to the board to review the board's decision. The writ must indicate the time by which the board's return must be made and served on the petitioner's attorney, which must be after ten days and may be extended by the court. Granting of the writ does not stay the proceedings on the decision under appeal, but on application and after notice to the board, the court may grant a restraining order if due cause is shown. 
(d)  The board's return must be verified and must concisely state any pertinent and material facts that show the grounds of the decision under appeal. The board is not required to return the original documents on which the board acted but may return certified or sworn copies of the documents or parts of the documents as required by the writ.

Sec. 111-509. - Design guidelines. 
    The appearance of the district is the result of an evolutionary process in which buildings stay the same, are altered or are completely replaced. This process is continuous and inevitable. Its success or failure depends on how sensitive these changes are to the existing framework of buildings. Certain elements of a building's appearance are addressed in more detail here as elements that contribute to the overall quality of the district. 
(1)  Storefronts. 
a.  Improvements. Improvements to buildings are encouraged through incentive programs for storefronts, signs, and fire safety enhancements. 
b.  Owners working together. Owners of one-story buildings, which are not part of a larger structure and therefore are more easily overwhelmed by larger neighboring buildings, should relate to the buildings on either side of them. The most effective approach for building owners in this situation is to use similar storefront and sign designs to create a unified, attractive row of buildings. 
c.  Materials. 
1.  Any original materials on the building's facade, such as brick, stone, or glass are also part of the building's architecture and must not be painted or covered over. 
2.  The following list of traditional and adaptable contemporary storefront materials must be utilized: 
(i)  Storefront window frames must be wood, hollow metal, or anodized aluminum; 
(ii)  Display windows must be clear glass or tinted glass which is still transparent; 
(iii)  Entrance door frames must be made of wood, steel, or aluminum; 
(iv)  Bulkheads must be finished with wood panels, brick, polished stone, glass, tile, masonry, or aluminum-clad plywood panels. 
3.  Not allowed: 
(i)  Fake bricks; 
(ii)  Stone and gravel aggregate materials; 
(iii)  Reflective windows; 

(iv)  All glass fronts; 
(v)  Sheet metal; 
(vi)  Aluminum, composite, or plastic siding; 
(vii)  Mirrored glass; or 
(viii)  Metal or prefabricated buildings. 
d.  Color. Painting is one of the most dramatic improvements that can be made to a building. Choosing the right combination of colors can unify the building elements within the facade as well as relate the building to others on the block. The following criteria must be adhered to when considering color selection: 
1.  Coordinate with other colors on the block; 
2.  The orientation of the building affects the appearance of colors; 
3.  Historically, certain color types were associated with architectural styles; 
4.  Colors must be used to highlight architectural details; 
5.  No more than one vivid color per building; 
6.  No more than three colors shall be used on one building; 
7.  Base color for wall surfaces and storefront pier; 
8.  Major trim color for cornices, window caps, window frames, columns, bulkheads; 
9.  Minor trim color for window sashes, doors, storefront frame, and other small details; 
10.  Bright and/or fluorescent colors are prohibited. 
e.  Windows. The style and type of windows help establish the historical character of buildings. Hence, the following shall be adhered to: 
1.  The original shape of the window as well as the original number and arrangement of panes shall be maintained; 
2.  Shutters, unless appropriate to the style of the building, are not allowed; 
3.  New window openings are not allowed unless they match the existing window configuration and their placement is consistent with the existing openings; 
4.  Original windows facing the street on which the business is addressed shall not be filled, boarded up, or painted without prior approval of the HDB; 
5.  Burglar bars may not be installed on the exterior of windows or doors facing a street; 
6.  Windows that have been blocked in, boarded up, or painted must be restored to their original appearance, size and type. When original wooden frames cannot be duplicated or afforded, aluminum frames of similar profiles must be used. Factory painted finishes for aluminum are available; 
7.  Mechanical devices such as air conditioners or exhaust vents shall not be placed in storefront windows. 
(2)  Awnings and canopies. The use of awnings or canopies is strongly recommended for all commercial buildings. They encourage pedestrian traffic by protecting them from excessive heat or rain. They protect display window merchandise from damage, regulate the amount of heat and direct sunlight entering a store, and serve as a sign or help identify the business. 
a.  The following standards apply to awnings and/or canopies: 

1.  Open air canopies or awnings of any type adjacent to or facing a street are prohibited. 
2.  Street level awnings or canopies shall be no less than eight feet above the sidewalk. 
3.  No portion shall extend closer than two feet to the face of the curbline and should project out four through six feet from the building, but not farther than two-thirds the distance from the building to the curb. 
4.  Only weather resistant canvas, vinyl, or standing seam metal are allowed (no wood or sheet metal). 
5.  All framing materials shall be steel or aluminum and must be attached directly to the building. 
6.  The shape must relate to other awnings and/or canopies on the same block. Recommended styles include standard, convex, dome, bullnose, concave, and marquee (see illustration). 
b.  Not allowed: 
1.  Sloped and/or slatted aluminum. 
2.  Mansard; awnings. 
3.  Wood, sheet metal, plastic, or fiberglass. 
(3)  Signs. All signs shall be subject to building permits and review as provided in the sign ordinance (section 46-116 et seq.). The function of the storefront sign is to inform the customer of the goods or services provided within. Limiting the amount of information to essentials most effectively conveys the sign message. Signs must be individual metal, plastic, or wood letters. A sign containing neon lights, is backlit, or has a plastic face is allowed. No plywood signs are allowed. Signs that are painted on the building shall be approved by the HDB prior to commencement of such painting. 
a.  General sign guidelines. 
1.  No new off-premises signs, including billboards, are allowed; 
2.  Signs are permitted on awnings provided they are painted, printed, or sewn onto the fabric; 
3.  Permanent banners or flags (excluding government flags) will not be allowed. Temporary banners or flags are allowed for a period not to exceed 30 days per calendar year; 
4.  Signs cannot obscure or destroy architectural detail on the building; 
5.  Rooftop signs are not allowed; 
6.  Window signs shall encompass no more than 30 percent of the total glass area, not including any neon outlining of the glass; 
7.  Total sign area of all signs on any building face, which also includes any windows, awnings, and canopies associated with such building face, shall not exceed the amount of linear building frontage facing the street (measured in feet) on which the building is addressed, multiplied by 1.5. Illustrative example: A building at 123 Anywhere Street has 50 feet of building frontage along Anywhere Street (i.e., it is 50 feet wide along Anywhere Street). The maximum available area for all signs on any particular building face shall not exceed 75 square feet (50 multiplied by 1.5). 
b.  Color. A dark background with light letters is most easily perceived by the human eye, depending on the base color of the building. A sign can be the best place to add lively color, but care should be taken to ensure that the sign colors compliment and relate to the building and its surroundings. 
(4)  Other exterior elements. 
a.  Fencing. Fencing must be in character with the surroundings. Barbed wire fences shall not be permitted. Fences of brick, wrought iron, stucco, wood or concrete shall be encouraged. Fence requirements as included in this chapter. 
b.  Walkways/sidewalks. Walkways or sidewalks must be maintained by the property owner in good condition and free of obstruction or debris. 
c.  Landscaping. Native and low water usage landscaping shall be encouraged. Public areas use of alleys as public space shall be encouraged. Projects containing courtyards, public art or landscaping visible to the public shall be encouraged.

Sec. 111-510. - New construction. 
(a)  Downtown buildings are situated in one of two arrangements relative to adjacent surroundings: hereinafter called either "infill buildings" or "stand-alone buildings" and are defined as follows: 
(1)  Infill buildings fill the width of space but not necessarily the depth of space between other buildings or groups of buildings. It should be flush with the adjoining buildings. 
(2)  A stand-alone building is situated not between other buildings or groups of buildings. One or both of its sides face toward "open" space.

    Airport means the Valley International Airport located in Harlingen, Texas. 
    Airport overlay zoning districts means the areas of land use within the controlled area of the airport and within the 65 and Greater LDN contours of the airport as established in the Federal Aviation Administration, FAR Part 150 Study and attached as Exhibit A to Ord. No. 01-31. 
    Board of adjustment means the Harlingen Zoning Board of Adjustment as set out in this chapter. 
    Centerline means a line extending through the midpoint of each end of a runway. 
    Elevation, airport, means the established elevation of the highest point on the usable landing area measured in feet from mean sea level which is 35 feet above mean sea level. 
    Hazard, airport, means a structure or object of natural growth that obstructs that air space required for the taking off, landing, and flight of aircraft or that interferes with visual, radar, radio, or other systems for tracking, acquiring data relating to, monitoring, or controlling aircraft. 
    Hazard area, airport, means any area of land or water upon which an airport hazard might be established if not prevented as provided in this article. 
    Landing area means the surface area of the airport used for the landing and taking off of aircraft. 
    Land use, compatible, means the use of land adjacent to the airport that does not endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the owners, occupants, or users of the land because of levels of noise or vibrations, or the risk of personal injury or property damage created by the operations of the airport, including the taking off and landing of aircraft. 
    LDN. See Yearly day-night average sound level. 
    Noise level reduction (NLR) means the reduction of outside noise transmitted inside a structure achieved through the incorporation of noise attenuation into the design and construction of the structure.

c.  One copy shall be filed in the office of the airport manager. 
(f)  Airport overlay zoning district boundaries. 
(1)  The airport overlay zoning district boundary lines shown on the official airport overlay zoning district map shall be located and delineated along contour lines established in the Federal Aviation Administration FAR Part 150 Study. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of the airport overlay zoning districts as shown on the official maps, the following rules shall apply: 
a.  Boundaries shall be scaled from the nearest physical feature shown on the map. 
b.  Boundaries may be scaled from the nearest platted lot line as shown on the map. 
c.  Distances not specifically indicated on the original airport overlay zoning district map shall be determined by a scaled measurement on the map. 
(2)  Where physical features on the ground differ from the information shown on the official airport overlay zoning district map or when there arises a question as to how or where a parcel of property is zoned and such questions cannot be resolved by the application of subsection (g) of this section, the property shall be considered to be classified as the more restrictive airport overlay zoning district. 
(3)  Where a parcel of land lies within more than one airport overlay zoning district, the zone within which each portion of the property is located shall apply individually to each portion of the development. 
(g)  Use of land and buildings. 
(1)  Within the airport overlay zoning districts as defined herein, no land shall hereafter be used and no structure or other object shall hereafter be erected, altered, converted, or modified other than for existing structures which have nonconforming status or for those compatible land uses permitted by underlying comprehensive zoning districts, as specified in the Harlingen Zoning Ordinance (No. 97-35), as amended. Additional land uses are prohibited in the airport overlay zoning districts, regardless of underlying zoning, as set forth in the following land use table:

(2)  Where any use of prohibited land and buildings set forth in subsection (h)(1) of this section conflicts with any use of land and buildings set forth in zoning ordinance No. 97-35, as amended, as an allowed use on the zoning district map, this section shall apply. 
(3)  Where the official airport overlay zoning district map indicates an area as being outside the limits of the City of Harlingen, the prohibited uses, as set forth in subsection (h)(1) of this section, shall apply as though the area is within the city and no structure or object shall be erected, altered, converted, or modified except to comply with uses not prohibited by this section. 
(4)  Subsection (h) of this section does not apply to property within the official boundaries of the airport. 
(5)  As an accessory use to an office, commercial or, industrial development located on a tract of land consisting of 20 or more acres in size, one dwelling unit may be located on the site provided the property owner dedicates, in advance of receiving a building permit, an aviation clear zone easement to the city. The purpose of this easement shall be to establish a maximum height restriction on the use of property and to hold the public harmless for any damages caused by noise, vibration, fumes, dust, fuel, fuel particles or other effects that may be caused by the operation of aircraft landing at, taking off from, or operating on or at, public airport facilities. 
(h)  Additional land use regulations. 
(1)  Within the City of Harlingen, all regulations in the zoning ordinance (No. 97-35), as amended, shall apply to the development of all property covered by the airport overlay zoning district map based on the underlying zoning of the property.

(3)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or other chapter of the city of this Code, no use may be made of land, water, or structures within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others or result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport; impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport; create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, taking off, or flight operations of aircraft utilizing the airport. 
(4)  When a subdivision plat or building permit is required for any property within an airport overlay zoning district for Valley International Airport, the property owner shall dedicate an aviation hazard easement to the city over and across that property. This easement shall establish a height restriction on the use of the property and hold the public harmless from any damages caused by noise, vibration, fumes, dust, fuel, fuel particles, or other effects that may be caused by the operation of aircraft taking off, landing, or operating on or near Valley International Airport. 
(i)  Noise attenuation requirements. 
(1)  Noise zones. For the purpose of this chapter, certain areas within the city boundaries are established as zones subject to significant noise from aircraft. These zones shall be known and designated 65 through 69 LDN and the 70 and greater LDN noise zones; both areas being shown on the airport overlay zoning district map. 
(2)  A structure which is located partly within a noise zone and partly outside, or located partly within one or more noise zones shall be considered to be entirely within the more restrictive of the noise zones within which it is located. 
(j)  Certification of plans. 
(1)  The chief building official shall not issue a building permit for any structure within the zones set forth in subsection (i) of this section unless the plans and specifications accompanying the application for said building permit have been certified by a registered professional engineer or registered professional architect in the State of Texas as meeting the noise level reduction (NLR) standards specified in subsection (k) of this section. 
(2)  The registered professional architect or engineer must certify that said plans and specifications shall reduce the noise impact from outdoor to indoor noise level, at least the minimum specified in this division, using commonly accepted engineering and architectural acoustical practices.

a.  Airport noise level of 65 through 69 LDN must be reduced by a minimum of 25 decibels. 
b.  Airport noise level of 70 and greater LDN must be reduced by a minimum of 30 decibels. 
(2)  The required minimum NLR applies to all portions of a structure where the public is received, office areas, public assembly rooms, sleeping areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low. 
(l)  Permits. 
(1)  No structure or tree shall be built or located in an airport overlay zoning district unless a permit is obtained. 
(2)  The chief building official shall not issue building or remodeling permits for any structure in an airport overlay zoning district unless the applicant fully complies with all provisions of this chapter.

(4)  Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient details to determine whether the resulting use would conform to the regulations of this chapter. If such determination is found to be in compliance with this chapter, the permit may be granted. No permit inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with article XVI of this chapter. 
(m)  Public improvements. The city shall withhold all public improvements including the maintenance of streets and the furnishings of water and sewer service unless the applicant for a building permit fully complies with all provisions of this chapter. 
(n)  Nonconforming uses and structures. The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any legal nonconforming use as set forth and governed by sections 111-357 and 111-358. 
(o)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding subsection (n) of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the city manager, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of Valley International Airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Valley International Airport, City of Harlingen, Texas. 
(p)  Appeals. 
(1)  Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected by any decision of the city staff made in administration of this chapter may appeal to the board of adjustment.
