PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Colleyville, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented through November 18, 2003, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice President of Production, and Elizabeth Butler, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Cynthia Singleton, City Secretary, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Section 3.10 - Investigation by the City Council:

(Amended November 7, 1995) 
Section 3.12 - Emergency Ordinances: 
    The City Council may adopt emergency ordinances only to meet public emergencies affecting life, health, property, or the public peace.

After adoption, the ordinance shall be published as required for other adopted ordinances. Every emergency ordinance so adopted, shall automatically stand repealed as of the sixty-first (61) day following the day on which it became effective, but this shall not prevent re-enactment of the emergency ordinance or as an ordinance in general under Section 3.11. 
(Amended May 7, 2005) 
Section 3.13 - Resolutions: 
    Any official action of the City Council not authorized by ordinance shall be authorized by resolution. All resolutions shall be read in open meeting of the City Council and shall be followed by public hearing.

If at any time during the fiscal year it appears probable to the City Manager that the revenues available will be insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, he shall report to the City Council without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any remedial actions taken by him and his recommendations as to any other steps to be taken. The City Council shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to prevent or minimize any deficit and for that purpose it may by ordinance reduce one (1) or more appropriations. 
(D)  Transfer of Appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year the City Manager may transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance among programs within a department, division, or office and, upon written request by the City Manager, the City Council may by ordinance transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance from one (1) department, office or agency to another. 
(E)  Limitations. No appropriation for debt service may be reduced below any amount required by law to be appropriated or by more than the amount of the unencumbered balance thereof.

Any authorization of payment or incurring of obligation in violation of the provisions of this Charter shall be void and any payment so made illegal. Such action shall be cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or made such payment or incurred such obligations, and he shall also be liable to the City for any amount so paid. However, this prohibition shall not be construed to prevent the making or authorizing of payments or making of contracts for capital improvements to be financed wholly or partly by the issuance of bonds, time warrants, certificates of indebtedness, or certificates of obligation, or to prevent the making of any contract or lease providing for payments beyond the end of the fiscal year, provided that such action is made or approved by ordinance. 
(B)  Financial Reports. The City Manager shall submit to the City Council at its second formal meeting each month the financial condition of the City by budget items, budget estimates versus accruals for the preceding month and for the fiscal year to date.

Sec. 2-56. - Arbitrage. 
    The Tax Reform Act of 1986 places limitations on the city's yield from investing certain tax-exempt bond proceeds, debt service funds and reserve funds. The rebate provisions require that the city compute earnings on investments from certain issues of bonds on a periodic basis to determine if rebate is required. 
    To determine the city's arbitrage position, the city is required to calculate the actual yield earned on the investment of the funds and compare it to the yield that would have been earned if the funds had been invested at a rate equal to the yield on the applicable bonds sold by the city. The rebate provisions state that periodically (not less than once every five years and not later than 60 days after maturity of the bonds), the city is required to pay the United States Treasury a rebate of any excess earnings. These restrictions require extreme precision in the monitoring and record keeping of investments, particularly in computing yields to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can dictate that the bonds become taxable, retroactively from the date of issuance. 
    The investment strategy for bond funds which fall under the arbitrage provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, is that the city will attempt to earn maximum allowable bond yield with market conditions permitting. 
(Ord. No. O-03-1420,  1(Exh. A), 9-16-03; Ord. No. O-10-1755,  1(Exh. A), 6-15-2010) 
Sec. 2-57. - Reporting requirements. 
    The finance director shall issue a written report quarterly to the city council concerning the city's investment transactions for the preceding quarter and describing in detail the investment position of the city as of the end of the quarter indicating the market values of all investments held during the quarter. The report shall list for each investment held during the quarter: The purchase price of the investment, the par value of the investment, the market value of the investment at the beginning of the quarter, market value of the investment at the end of the quarter, the market change from the beginning until the end of the quarter, and fully accrued interest for the period.

Sec. 2-58. - Training requirements. 
    Both the finance director and assistant to the finance director shall complete ten hours of training every two years as required by the Public Funds Investment Act. This training may be obtained from the following sources: North Central Texas Council of Governments, Government Treasurer's Organization of Texas, Government Finance Officer's of Texas, or Texas Municipal League.

If the code official finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and the fees specified in this article and all fees for water tap and sewer service have been paid, the code official shall issue a permit to the applicant. 
    When the code official issues the permit where plans are required, the code official shall endorse in writing or stamp the plans and specifications APPROVED. Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the code official, and all work regulated by this code shall be done in accordance with the approved plans. 
    The code official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a plumbing system before the entire plans and specifications for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this code. The holder of a partial permit shall proceed without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted. 
(b)  Withholding of permits. The code official is authorized to withhold permits to any person for the reasons set forth herein upon written notice to such person. The determination of the code official may be appealed to the board as provided in this code.

(1)  Any person until such time as the plumbing for which a permit was previously issued has been completed or is being performed in an efficient manner in a reasonable length of time. 
(2)  Any person who is delinquent in the payment of fees owed the City of Colleyville. 
(3)  Any person who has performed previous jobs which remain in violation of this code. 
(c)  Validity. The issuance of a permit or approval of construction documents shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or of other ordinance of the City of Colleyville, Texas. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code shall be valid. 
    The issuance of a permit based upon construction documents and other data shall not prevent the code official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said construction documents and other data or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of this code or of other ordinances of the City of Colleyville. 
(d)  Expiration. Every permit issued by the code official under the provisions of this code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180 days from the date of such permit, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of 180 days. Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained and the fee shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original construction documents for such work, and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee. 
(e)  Extensions. Any permittee holding an unexpired permit shall have the right to apply for an extension of the time within which the permittee will commence work under that permit when work is unable to be commenced within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The code official shall extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days if there is reasonable cause. No permit shall be extended more than once. 
(f)  Suspension or revocation of permit. The code official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this code. 
(g)  Administrative hold. Any administrative discrepancy including but not limited to, delinquency in payments, returned checks, failure to pay for re-inspection, investigation or registration fees, and failure to keep registration, insurance or bond up-to-date, may result in a hold being placed on issuance of permits and performance of inspections of existing permits until the administrative discrepancy is corrected. For the purpose of this section, the term "up-to-date" shall mean that whenever any of these items is required by this or any other code to obtain a permit covered by this code, it shall be maintained current and in effect until the permit is finaled. 
(h)  Retention of plans. One set of approved plans, specifications and computations shall be retained by the code official until final approval of the work covered therein. One set of approved construction documents shall be returned to the applicant, and said set shall be kept on the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. 
(i)  Job abandonment. If after a permit is issued under the provisions hereof, the applicant abandons the job, becomes incapacitated or his/her services are terminated prior to final inspection and approval thereof by the code official and before the permit has expired, the applicant or his lawful legal representative shall immediately notify the office of the code official in writing. Upon such notification, the code official shall immediately have an inspection made of the work completed to that time, and may revoke the outstanding permit and require that a new permit with the payment of fees be obtained before the work is allowed to resume.

    Exceptions: 
(1)  This provision shall not apply to emergency work when it has been proven to the satisfaction of the code official that such work was urgently necessary and that it was not practical to obtain a permit before the commencement of the work. In all cases, a permit must be obtained as soon as it is practical to do so, and if there be an unreasonable delay in obtaining such permit, an investigation fee as herein provided shall be charged.

DIVISION 7. - INSPECTIONS AND CODE OFFICIAL 

Sec. 18-25. - Inspections. 
(a)  Inspection required. All building construction for which a permit is required by this code shall be inspected by the code official. No portion of any construction work requiring prior inspection approval shall be concealed until inspected and approved. Neither the code official nor the City of Colleyville shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of material required to permit inspection. The holder of the permit shall be responsible for the scheduling of such inspections. 
(b)  The code official shall issue written procedures that describe the various phases of inspection and make these procedures available to the public upon request. 
(c)  Other inspections. In addition to any scheduled inspection, the code official may make or require other inspections of any construction work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this code. 
(d)  No implied authorization to proceed. Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the City of Colleyville. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. 
(e)  Re-inspection and testing. Where any work does not pass any initial inspection, the necessary corrections shall be made to comply with this code. The work shall then be resubmitted to the code official for inspection. 
(f)  Inspection requests. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a permit to notify the code official that such work is ready for inspection. The code official may require that every request for inspection be filed at least one working day before such inspection is desired. Such request may be in writing or by telephone, at the option of the code official. 
    The person requesting an inspection required by this code shall provide access to and means for proper inspection of such work. When the work is within a residence where access is dependent upon the occupant being home, the person doing the work shall make arrangements for inspections. Failure to make arrangements within a timely manner or the inability for the inspector to do the inspections at the arranged times will result in reinspection fees being assessed to the person doing the work. 
    Exception: If the re-inspection fee is for a "Final Inspection" for a residence where access is dependent upon the occupant, after the fee has been paid by the person doing the work additional arrangements for the final inspection and penalties for not receiving such inspection shall fall on the occupant. 
    This shall not relieve the person doing the work from having to correct improper work and such accompanying penalties should the work fail re-inspection. 
(g)  Re-inspections. A re-inspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or re-inspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. 
    This section is not to be interpreted as requiring re-inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or re-inspection. 
    Re-inspection fees may be assessed when the building site is not in compliance with codes and ordinances applicable to construction sites, approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the code official. 
    To obtain a re-inspection, the applicant shall file an application in writing on a form furnished for that purpose and pay the re-inspection fee in accordance with the applicable fee schedule. 
    In instances where re-inspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid. 
(h)  Right of entry for inspections. The application for permit shall be deemed to be granting authority to enter the property for the purpose of inspections. No owner or occupant or any other person having charge, care, or control of any building or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper demand is made as provided in this article, to promptly permit entry therein by the code official or his authorized representative for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this article. Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

(b)  Rule-making authority. The code official shall have authority as necessary in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare to render interpretations of this code as may be deemed necessary in order to clarify the application of the provisions of this code and to issue rules and procedures for the implementation of the provisions of this code to secure the intent thereof and to designate requirements applicable due to local climatic or other conditions. Such rules shall not have the effect of waiving requirements specifically provided for in this code, or of violating accepted engineering practice involving public safety. 
(c)  Applications and permits. The code official shall receive applications, collect fees and issue permits for the construction, alteration or repair of buildings and structures and inspect the premises for which such permits have been issued, and enforce compliance with the provisions of this code. The code official shall keep records of all permits issued and all inspections performed. 
(d)  Inspections. The code official or authorized agent shall make all the required inspections. All inspection reports shall be in writing.

Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of this code, or whenever the code official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises, any condition or violation of this code that make the building or premises unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or hazardous, the code official shall have the authority to enter the building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed upon the code official by this code. If such building or premises is occupied, the code official shall present his credentials to the occupant and request entry. If building or premises is unoccupied, the code official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the building or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the code official shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. 
    When the code official shall have first obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner, occupant, or person having charge, care or control of any building or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the code official for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this code.

(g)  Identification. The code official shall carry proper identification when inspecting structures or premises in the performance of duties under this code.

The code official shall keep official records of applications received, permits and certificates issued, fees collected, reports of inspections, and notices and orders issued. Such records shall be retained in the official records for the period required for the retention of public records. 
(j)  Restriction of employees. An official or employee connected with the department of building inspection shall not be engaged in or connected with the furnishing of labor, materials or appliances for the construction, alteration or maintenance of a building within the City of Colleyville; and such officer or employee shall not engage in any work that conflicts with official duties or with the interests of the department. 
(k)  Liability. The code official charged with the enforcement of this code, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of the duties required by this code or other pertinent law or ordinance shall not thereby be rendered personally liable for damages that may accrue to persons or property as a result of an act or by reason of an act or omission in the discharge of such duties. A suit brought against the code official or employee because of such act or omission performed by the code official or employee in the enforcement of any provision of such codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this code or enforced by the code enforcement agency shall be defended by this jurisdiction until final termination of such proceedings and any judgment resulting therefrom shall be assumed by this jurisdiction. 
    The liability exemption and defense protection provided in this section are not extended to Third Party Companies, nor their employees. 
    This code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling any building or structure for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the code enforcement agency or its parent jurisdiction be held as assuming any such liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this code or any permits or certificates issued under this code.

Sec. 18-171. - Application for permit. 
(a)  Application. Any person entitled to apply for and receive a permit as provided in this article shall make application on forms provided by the code official. The application shall be accompanied by such information as may be necessary to determine whether the installation, as proposed, will be in conformity with the requirements of this code. Every such application shall: 
(1)  Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for which application is made. 
(2)  Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by legal description, street address or similar description that will readily identify and definitely locate the proposed building or work. 
(3)  Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended when deemed necessary. 
(4)  Be accompanied by plans, diagrams, computations and specifications and other data related to the proposed work. 
(5)  Be signed by the applicant or an authorized agent of the applicant. 
(6)  Give such other data and information as may be required by the code official to determine compliance with this code. 
(b)  Plans and specifications. Plans, specifications, engineering calculations, diagrams, soil investigation reports, special inspection and structural observation programs and other data shall constitute the submittal documents and shall be submitted in one or more sets with each application for a permit. When such plans are not prepared by an architect or engineer, the code official may require the applicant submitting such plans or other data to demonstrate that state law does not require that the plans be prepared by a licensed architect or engineer. The code official may require plans, computations and specifications to be prepared and designed by an engineer or architect licensed by the state to practice as such even if not required by state law. 
    Exception: The code official may waive the submission of plans, calculations, construction inspection requirements and other data if it is found that the nature of the work applied for is such that reviewing of plans is not necessary to obtain compliance with this code. 
(c)  Information on plans and specifications. Plans and specifications shall be drawn to scale upon substantial paper or cloth and shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the location, nature and extent of the work proposed and show in detail that it will conform to the provisions of this code and all relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. 
    Plans for building of other than Group R, Division 3 and Group U Occupancies shall indicate how required structural and fire-resistive integrity will be maintained where penetrations will be made for plumbing and similar systems. 
(d)  Architect or engineer of record. When it is required that documents be prepared by an architect or engineer, the code official may require the owner to engage and designate on the permit application an architect or engineer who shall act as the architect or engineer of record. If the circumstances require, the owner may designate a substitute architect or engineer of record who shall perform all of the duties required of the original architect or engineer of record. The code official shall be notified in writing by the owner if the architect or engineer of record is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties. 
    The architect or engineer of record shall be responsible for reviewing and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building. 
(e)  Deferred submittals. For the purpose of this section, deferred submittals are defined as those portions of the design that are not submitted at the time of the application and that are to be submitted to the code official within a specified period. 
    Deferral of any submittal items shall have prior approval of the code official. The architect or engineer of record shall list the deferred submittals on the plans and shall submit the deferred submittal documents for review by the code official. 
    Submittal documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to the architect or engineer of record who shall review them and forward them to the code official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal documents have been reviewed and that they have been found to be in general conformance with the design of the building. The deferred submittal items shall not be installed until their design and submittal documents have been approved by the code official. 
(f)  Expiration of plan review. Applications for which no permit is issued within 180 days following the date of application shall expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the code official. 
    The code official may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period not exceeding 180 days on request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken. No application shall be extended more than once. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit plans and pay a new plan review fee. 
(Ord. No. O-01-1310,  12, 11-7-01) 
Sec. 18-172. - Permit issuance. 
(a)  Issuance. The application, plans, specifications, computations and other data filed by an applicant for a permit shall be reviewed by the code official. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of this jurisdiction to verify compliance with any applicable laws under its jurisdiction. If the code official finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and the fees specified in this article and all fees for water tap and sewer service have been paid, the code official shall issue a permit to the applicant. 
    When the code official issues the permit where plans are required, the code official shall endorse in writing or stamp the plans and specifications APPROVED. Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the code official, and all work regulated by this code shall be done in accordance with the approved plans. 
    The code official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a plumbing system before the entire plans and specifications for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this code. The holder of a partial permit shall proceed without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted. 
(b)  Withholding of permits. The code official is authorized to withhold permits to any person for the reasons set forth herein upon written notice to such person. The determination of the code official may be appealed to the board as provided in this code. 
    The code official is authorized to withhold the issuance of plumbing permits to: 
(1)  Any person until such time as the plumbing for which a permit was previously issued has been completed or is being performed in an efficient manner in a reasonable length of time. 
(2)  Any person who is delinquent in the payment of fees owed the City of Colleyville. 
(3)  Any person who has performed previous jobs which remain in violation of this code. 
(c)  Validity. The issuance of a permit or approval of construction documents shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or of other ordinance of the City of Colleyville, Texas. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code shall be valid. 
    The issuance of a permit based upon construction documents and other data shall not prevent the code official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said construction documents and other data or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of this code or of other ordinances of the City of Colleyville. 
(d)  Expiration. Every permit issued by the code official under the provisions of this code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180 days from the date of such permit, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of 180 days. Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained and the fee shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original construction documents for such work, and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee. 
(e)  Extensions. Any permittee holding an unexpired permit shall have the right to apply for an extension of the time within which the permittee will commence work under that permit when work is unable to be commenced within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The code official shall extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days if there is reasonable cause. No permit shall be extended more than once. 
(f)  Suspension or revocation of permit. The code official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this code. 
(g)  Administrative hold. Any administrative discrepancy including but not limited to, delinquency in payments, returned checks, failure to pay for reinspection, investigation or registration fees, and failure to keep registration, insurance or bond up-to-date, may result in a hold being placed on issuance of permits and performance of inspections of existing permits until the administrative discrepancy is corrected. For the purpose of this section, the term "up-to-date" shall mean that whenever any of these items is required by this or any other code to obtain a permit covered by this code, it shall be maintained current and in effect until the permit is finaled. 
(h)  Retention of plans. One set of approved plans, specifications and computations shall be retained by the code official until final approval of the work covered therein. One set of approved construction documents shall be returned to the applicant, and said set shall be kept on the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. 
(i)  Job abandonment. If, after a permit is issued under the provisions hereof, the applicant abandons the job, becomes incapacitated or his/her services are terminated prior to final inspection and approval thereof by the code official and before the permit has expired, the applicant or his lawful legal representative shall immediately notify the office of the code official in writing. Upon such notification, the code official shall immediately have an inspection made of the work completed to that time, and may revoke the outstanding permit and require that a new permit with the payment of fees be obtained before the work is allowed to resume. 
(Ord. No. O-01-1310,  13, 11-7-01) 
Sec. 18-173. - Plumbing permit fees.

(3)  Not more than 80 percent of the plan review fee paid when an application for a permit for which a plan review fee has been paid is withdrawn or cancelled before any plan review effort has been expended. 
The code official shall not authorize the refunding of any fee paid except upon written application filed by the original permittee not later than 180 days after the date of fee payment. 
(Ord. No. O-01-1310,  14, 11-7-01) 
Sec. 18-174. - Investigation fees for work without a permit. 
(a)  Investigation. Whenever any work for which a permit is required by this code has been commenced without first obtaining said permit, an investigation fee equal to the amount of the permit shall be charged, which shall be separate from any permit fee required by this code. 
    Exceptions: 
(1)  This provision shall not apply to emergency work when it has been proven to the satisfaction of the code official that such work was urgently necessary and that it was not practical to obtain a permit before the commencement of the work. In all cases, a permit must be obtained as soon as it is practical to do so, and if there be an unreasonable delay in obtaining such permit, an investigation fee as herein provided shall be charged. 
(2)  The investigation fee required shall be charged for work for which an inspection has been requested and no permit has been obtained. 
(b)  Cancellation of permit. A plumbing permit may be cancelled by the applicant at any time within six months of the date of its issuance. If no work has been done under such permit, the code official, when requested in writing by the applicant, shall refund 90 percent of the permit fee paid. 
(Ord. No. O-01-1310,  15, 11-7-01) 
DIVISION 4. - INSPECTIONS AND INSPECTORS 

Sec. 18-175. - Inspections. 
(a)  Inspection required. All plumbing systems for which a permit is required by this code shall be inspected by the code official. No portion of any plumbing system shall be concealed until inspected and approved. Neither the code official nor the City of Colleyville shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of material required to permit inspection. The holder of the permit shall be responsible for the scheduling of such inspections. Plumbing systems regulated by this code shall not be connected to the water, energy fuel supply, or the sewer system until authorized by the code official. 
    Exceptions: 
(1)  The requirements of this section shall not be considered to prohibit the operation of any plumbing installed to replace existing equipment or fixtures serving an occupied portion of the building in the event a request for inspection of such equipment or fixture has been filed with the Code Official not more than 72 hours after such replacement work is completed, and before any portion of such equipment is concealed by any permanent portion of the building. 
(2)  When approved by the code official, the inspection process as required by this code may be performed by an approved Third Party Organization. 
(b)  Rough-in inspection. This inspection shall be made after trenches or ditches are excavated and bedded, piping installed, and before any backfill is put in place. When excavated soil contains rocks, broken concrete, frozen chunks and other rubble that would damage or break the piping or cause corrosive action, clean backfill shall be on the job site. 
(c)  Top-out inspection. This inspection shall be made after the roof, framing, fire blocking, fire stopping, draft stopping and bracing are in place and all sanitary, storm and water distribution piping is rough-in and prior to the installation of wall or ceiling membranes. 
(d)  Final inspection. This inspection shall be made after the building is complete, all plumbing fixtures are in place, properly connected, and the structure is ready for occupancy. 
(e)  Other inspections. In addition to the inspections specified above, the code official may make or require other inspections of any plumbing work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this code or state plumbing laws. 
(f)  Testing. Plumbing work and systems shall be tested as required in accordance with this section and as follows: 
(1)  International Plumbing Code, Section 312. 
(2)  International Fuel Gas Code, Section 406. 
Tests shall be made by the permit holder and observed by the code official. 
(g)  No implied approval authority. Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the City of Colleyville. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. 
(h)  Equipment, material and labor for tests. All equipment, material and labor required for testing a plumbing system or part thereof shall be furnished by the permit holder. 
(i)  Re-inspection and testing. Where any work or installation does not pass any initial test or inspection, the necessary corrections shall be made to comply with this code. The work or installation shall then be resubmitted to the code official for inspection and testing. 
(j)  Inspection requests. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a permit to notify the code official that such work is ready for inspection. The code official may require that every request for inspection be filed at least one working day before such inspection is desired. Such request may be in writing or by telephone, at the option of the code official. 
    The person doing the work authorized by the permit shall make sure that the work will stand tests prescribed elsewhere in this code, before giving the above notification. 
    It shall be the duty of the person requesting inspections required by this code to provide access to and means for proper inspection of such work. When the work is within a residence where access is dependent upon the occupant being home, it shall be the duty of the person doing the work to make arrangements for inspections. Failure to make arrangements within a timely manner or the inability for the inspector to do the inspections at the arranged times will result in re-inspection fees being assessed to the person doing the work. 
    Exception: If the re-inspection fee is for a "Final Inspection" for a residence where access is dependent upon the occupant, after the fee has been paid by the person doing the work additional arrangements for the final inspection and penalties for not receiving such inspection shall fall on the occupant. 
    This shall not relieve the person doing the work from having to correct improper work and such accompanying penalties should the work fail re-inspection. 
(k)  Inspection notice. Upon inspection, the code official shall complete an inspection notice indicating approval or disapproval of the work completed at the time of inspection. The inspection notice shall be furnished to the plumbing contractor or an agent of the permit holder. 
(l)  Re-inspections fees. A re-inspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or re-inspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. 
    This section is not to be interpreted as requiring re-inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or re-inspection. 
    Re-inspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the code official. 
    To obtain a re-inspection, the applicant shall file an application in writing on a form furnished for that purpose and pay the re-inspection fee in accordance with the applicable fee schedule. 
    In instances where re-inspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

(k)  Liability. The code official charged with the enforcement of this code, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of the duties required by this code or other pertinent law or ordinance shall not thereby be rendered personally liable for damages that may accrue to persons or property as a result of an act or by reason of an act or omission in the discharge of such duties. A suit brought against the code official or employee because of such act or omission performed by the code official or employee in the enforcement of any provision of such codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this code or enforced by the code enforcement agency shall be defended by this jurisdiction until final termination of such proceedings and any judgment resulting therefrom shall be assumed by this jurisdiction. 
    The liability exemption and defense protection provided in this section are not extended to Third Party Companies, nor their employees. 
    This code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling any building or structure for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the code enforcement agency or its parent jurisdiction be held as assuming any such liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this code or any permits or certificates issued under this code.

    The architect or engineer of record shall be responsible for reviewing and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building. 
(e)  Deferred submittals. For the purpose of this section, deferred submittals are defined as those portions of the design that are not submitted at the time of the application and that are to be submitted to the code official within a specified period. 
    Deferral of any submittal items shall have prior approval of the code official. The architect or engineer of record shall list the deferred submittals on the plans and shall submit the deferred submittal documents for review by the code official. 
    Submittal documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to the architect or engineer of record who shall review them and forward them to the code official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal documents have been reviewed and that they have been found to be in general conformance with the design of the building.

Sec. 18-213. - Permit issuance. 
(a)  Issuance. The application, plans, specifications, computations and other data filed by an applicant for a permit shall be reviewed by the code official. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of this jurisdiction to verify compliance with any applicable laws under its jurisdiction. If the code official finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and the fees specified in this article and all fees for water tap and sewer service have been paid, the code official shall issue a permit to the applicant. 
    When the code official issues the permit where plans are required, the code official shall endorse in writing or stamp the plans and specifications APPROVED. Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the code official, and all work regulated by this code shall be done in accordance with the approved plans. 
    The code official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a mechanical system before the entire plans and specifications for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this code. The holder of a partial permit shall proceed without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted. 
(b)  Withholding of permits. The code official is authorized to withhold permits to any person for the reasons set forth herein upon written notice to such person. The determination of the code official may be appealed to the board as provided in this code.

No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code shall be valid. 
    The issuance of a permit based upon construction documents and other data shall not prevent the code official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said construction documents and other data or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of this code or of other ordinances of the City of Colleyville. 
(d)  Expiration. Every permit issued by the code official under the provisions of this code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180 days from the date of such permit, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of 180 days. Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained and the fee shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original construction documents for such work, and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee. 
(e)  Extensions. Any permittee holding an unexpired permit shall have the right to apply for an extension of the time within which the permittee will commence work under that permit when work is unable to be commenced within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The code official shall extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days if there is reasonable cause. No permit shall be extended more than once. 
(f)  Suspension or revocation of permit. The code official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this code. 
(g)  Administrative hold. Any administrative discrepancy including but not limited to, delinquency in payments, returned checks, failure to pay for reinspection, investigation or registration fees, and failure to keep registration, insurance or bond up-to-date, may result in a hold being placed on issuance of permits and performance of inspections of existing permits until the administrative discrepancy is corrected. For the purpose of this section, the term "up-to-date" shall mean that whenever any of these items is required by this or any other code to obtain a permit covered by this code, it shall be maintained current and in effect until the permit is finaled. 
(h)  Retention of plans. One set of approved plans, specifications and computations shall be retained by the code official until final approval of the work covered therein. One set of approved construction documents shall be returned to the applicant, and said set shall be kept on the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. 
(i)  Job abandonment. If, after a permit is issued under the provisions hereof, the applicant abandons the job, becomes incapacitated or his/her services are terminated prior to final inspection and approval thereof by the code official and before the permit has expired, the applicant or his lawful legal representative shall immediately notify the office of the code official in writing. Upon such notification, the code official shall immediately have an inspection made of the work completed to that time, and may revoke the outstanding permit and require that a new permit with the payment of fees be obtained before the work is allowed to resume. 
(Ord. No. O-02-1333,  13, 2-19-02)

    Exceptions: 
(1)  This provision shall not apply to emergency work when it has been proven to the satisfaction of the code official that such work was urgently necessary and that it was not practical to obtain a permit before the commencement of the work. In all cases, a permit must be obtained as soon as it is practical to do so, and if there be an unreasonable delay in obtaining such permit, an investigation fee as herein provided shall be charged. 
(2)  The investigation fee required shall be charged for work for which an inspection has been requested and no permit has been obtained. 
(b)  Cancellation of permit. A mechanical permit may be cancelled by the applicant at any time within six months of the date of its issuance. If no work has been done under such permit, the code official, when requested in writing by the applicant, shall refund 90 percent of the permit fee paid.

DIVISION 4. - INSPECTIONS AND INSPECTORS 

Sec. 18-216. - Inspections. 
(a)  Inspection required. All mechanical systems for which a permit is required by this code shall be inspected by the code official. No portion of any mechanical system shall be concealed until inspected and approved. Neither the code official nor the City of Colleyville shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of material required to permit inspection. The holder of the permit shall be responsible for the scheduling of such inspections. Mechanical systems regulated by this code shall not be connected to the water, energy fuel supply, or the sewer system until authorized by the code official. 
    Exceptions: 
(1)  The requirements of this section shall not be considered to prohibit the operation of any mechanical installed to replace existing equipment or fixtures serving an occupied portion of the building in the event a request for inspection of such equipment or fixture has been filed with the code official not more than 72 hours after such replacement work is completed, and before any portion of such equipment is concealed by any permanent portion of the building. 
(2)  When approved by the code official, the inspection process as required by this code may be performed by an approved Third Party Organization. 
(b)  Rough-in inspection. This inspection shall be made after trenches or ditches are excavated and bedded, piping installed, and before any backfill is put in place. When excavated soil contains rocks, broken concrete, frozen chunks and other rubble that would damage or break the piping or cause corrosive action, clean backfill shall be on the job site. 
(c)  Top-out inspection. This inspection shall be made after the roof, framing, fire blocking, fire stopping, draft stopping and bracing are in place and all sanitary, storm and water distribution piping is rough-in and prior to the installation of wall or ceiling membranes. 
(d)  Final inspection. This inspection shall be made after the building is complete, all mechanical fixtures are in place, properly connected, and the structure is ready for occupancy. 
(e)  Other inspections. In addition to the inspections specified above, the code official may make or require other inspections of any mechanical work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this code or State mechanical laws. 
(f)  Testing. Mechanical work and systems shall be tested as required in accordance with this section and as follows: 
(1)  International Mechanical Code, Section 312. 
(2)  International Fuel Gas Code, Section 406. 
Tests shall be made by the permit holder and observed by the code official. 
(g)  No implied approval authority. Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the City of Colleyville. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. 
(h)  Equipment, material and labor for tests. All equipment, material and labor required for testing a mechanical system or part thereof shall be furnished by the permit holder. 
(i)  Re-inspection and testing. Where any work or installation does not pass any initial test or inspection, the necessary corrections shall be made to comply with this code. The work or installation shall then be resubmitted to the code official for inspection and testing. 
(j)  Inspection requests. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a permit to notify the code official that such work is ready for inspection. The code official may require that every request for inspection be filed at least one working day before such inspection is desired. Such request may be in writing or by telephone, at the option of the code official. 
    The person doing the work authorized by the permit shall make sure that the work will stand tests prescribed elsewhere in this code, before giving the above notification. 
    It shall be the duty of the person requesting inspections required by this code to provide access to and means for proper inspection of such work. When the work is within a residence where access is dependent upon the occupant being home, it shall be the duty of the person doing the work to make arrangements for inspections. Failure to make arrangements within a timely manner or the inability for the inspector to do the inspections at the arranged times will result in re-inspection fees being assessed to the person doing the work. 
    Exception: If the re-inspection fee is for a "final inspection" for a residence where access is dependent upon the occupant, after the fee has been paid by the person doing the work additional arrangements for the final inspection and penalties for not receiving such inspection shall fall on the occupant. 
    This shall not relieve the person doing the work from having to correct improper work and such accompanying penalties should the work fail reinspection. 
(k)  Inspection notice. Upon inspection, the code official shall complete an inspection notice indicating approval or disapproval of the work completed at the time of inspection. The inspection notice shall be furnished to the mechanical contractor or an agent of the permit holder. 
(l)  Re-inspections fees. A re-inspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or re-inspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. 
    This section is not to be interpreted as requiring re-inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or re-inspection. 
    Re-inspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the code official. 
    To obtain a re-inspection, the applicant shall file an application in writing on a form furnished for that purpose and pay the re-inspection fee in accordance with the applicable fee schedule. 
    In instances where re-inspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

    Basic service tier means a separately available service tier to which subscription is required for access to any other tier of service, including as a minimum, but not limited to, all must-carry signals, all PEG channels, and all domestic television signals other than superstations, provided by the cable operator to any subscribers, except a signal of a television station which is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier beyond the local service area of such station, and any additional video programming signals as a service added to the basic tier by the cable operator. 
    Benchmark means a per channel rate of charge for cable service and associated equipment which the FCC has determined is reasonable. 
    Cable Act of 1992 means the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992.

    Cable service means the one-way transmission to subscribers of video programming, or other programming service; and, subscriber interaction, if any, which is required for the selection of such video programming or other programming service. For the purposes of this definition, "video programming" is programming provided by, or generally considered comparable to programming provided by a television broadcast station; and "other programming service" is information that a cable operator makes available to all subscribers generally. 
    Cable system means a facility consisting of a set of closed transmission paths and associated signal generation, reception, and control equipment that is designed to provide cable service which includes video programming and which is provided to multiple subscribers within a community, but such term does not include: 
(1)  A facility that serves only to retransmit the television signals of one or more television broadcast stations; 
(2)  A facility that serves only subscribers in one or more multiple unit dwellings under common ownership, control or management, unless such facility uses any public right-of-way; 
(3)  A facility of a common carrier which is subject, in whole or in part, to the provisions of title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, except that such facility shall be considered a cable system to the extent such facility is used in the transmission of video programming directly to subscribers; or 
(4)  Any facilities of any electric utility used solely for operating its electric utility systems. 
    Channel means a unit of cable service identified and selected by a channel number or similar designation. 
    Cost of service showing means a filing in which the cable operator attempts to show, in a manner consistent with FCC regulations, that the benchmark rate or the price cap is not sufficient to allow the cable operator to fully recover the costs of providing the basic service tier and to continue to attract capital. 
    FCC means the Federal Communications Commission. 
    Initial basic cable rates means the rates that the cable operator is charging for the basic service tier, including charges for associated equipment, on the date the city notifies the cable operator of the city's qualification and intent to regulate basic cable rates. 
    Initial date of regulation means the date on which the city notifies the cable operator of the city's qualification and intent to regulate basic cable rates. 
    Initial permitted per channel charge means the permitted per channel charge on the initial date of regulation which shall be determined by the city council to be lawful either under the benchmark analysis or through a cost-of-service showing. 
    Maximum monthly charge means the maximum amount per month which a cable operator may charge per subscriber for a tier of regulated programming services offered by a cable system and shall consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. 
    Must-carry signal means the signal of any local broadcast station (except superstations) which is required to be carried on the cable system and for which the local broadcast station has notified the cable operator of its election for must-carry rights. 
    PEG channel means the channel capacity designated for public, educational, or governmental use required by the franchise of the cable system to be provided to subscribers, and facilities and equipment for the use of that channel capacity. 
    Price cap means the ceiling set by the FCC on future increases in basic cable rates regulated by the city, based on a formula using the GNP fixed weight price index, reflecting general increases in the cost of doing business and changes in overall inflation. 
    Reasonable rate standard means a per channel rate that is at or below the benchmark or price cap level. 
    Subsequent permitted per channel charge means the permitted charge per channel after the initial date of regulation determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing or the prior permitted per channel charge previously approved by the city council, adjusted for inflation and external costs in accordance with the price cap analysis. 
    Superstation means any nonlocal broadcast signal secondarily transmitted by satellite.

Cross reference- Definitions generally,  1-2. 
Sec. 26-67. - Review of initial basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. Upon the adoption of the ordinance from which this division derives, and the certification of the city by the FCC, the city shall immediately notify all cable operators in the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992. 
(b)  Cable operator response. Within 30 days of receiving notice from the city, a cable operator shall file with the city its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates, including FCC form 393 or any other forms prescribed by the FCC to be used by cable operators to demonstrate the reasonableness of their rates. 
(c)  Expedited determination and public hearing. If the city council is able to expeditiously determine that the initial basic rates appear to be within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark analysis in subsection (g) of this section, the city council shall: 
(1)  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
(2)  After consideration of the views of interested persons, either: 
a.  Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city; or 
b.  Act to extend the review period as provided in subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the city council is unable to determine whether the initial basic cable rates are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city council shall, within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its initial basic cable rates with the city and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety days if the city council needs more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or 
b.  One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark. 
(2)  If the city council has not made a decision within the 90-day or 150-day period, the city council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period directing the cable operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the initial basic cable rates and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the initial basic cable rates, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(f)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the initial basic cable rates may request the city secretary to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city secretary with the objector's name and address. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its initial basic cable rates schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the city council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's findings, the initial maximum monthly charge shall be established as follows: 
(1)  The initial permitted per channel charge shall be determined as follows: 
a.  If the initial basic cable rates contain a per channel charge for regulated programming services and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation equal to or below the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the date of initial regulation, then the permitted per channel charge shall be the per channel charge in effect on the date of initial regulation, adjusted for equipment. 
b.  If: (i) the initial basic cable rates contain a per channel charge for regulated programming services and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation, and (ii) the per channel charge for regulated programming services and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was above the benchmark per channel charge, then the initial permitted per channel charge is nine-tenths of the per channel charge in effect on September 30, 1992, but no lower than the benchmark per channel charge, additionally adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels. 
c.  If: (i) the initial basic cable rates contain a per channel charge for regulated programming services and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation, and (ii) the per channel charge for regulated programming services and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was below the benchmark per channel charge, then the initial permitted per channel charge is the benchmark rate per channel adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on all regulated tiers. 
(2)  The initial maximum monthly charge shall be determined by multiplying the initial permitted per channel charge times the number of channels on the basic service tier plus a charge for franchise fees. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the level permitted using the benchmark analysis, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a maximum monthly charge per subscriber above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The city council will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992, rates minus ten percent will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's initial basic cable rates, the city council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following: 
a.  If the initial basic cable rates are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or are justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the city council shall approve the initial basic cable rates as the maximum monthly charge per subscriber; or 
b.  If the initial basic cable rates are not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify such rates, the city council shall establish the maximum monthly charge per subscriber that is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that is justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the city council determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the city council may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) of this section, as applicable. In addition, the city council may order the cable operator to pay refunds to subscribers of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments). The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city council's decision resolution. 
(3)  Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If initial basic cable rates of a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were objections made by other parties to the initial basic cable rates, the resolution must state the reason for the decision and the city council must give public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in the official newspaper of the city. 
(j)  Appeal. The city council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. O-94-941,  2, 4-19-94) 
Sec. 26-68. - Review of request for increase in basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the city and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of the initial maximum monthly charge per subscriber. 
(b)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the city council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the city council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  After consideration of the views of interested persons, either: 
1.  Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city; or 
2.  Act to extend the review period as provided in subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  If the city council takes no action within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go into effect. 
(c)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the city council is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety days if the city council needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and 
b.  One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap. 
(2)  The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period. 
(3)  If the city council has not made a decision within the 90-day or 150-day period, the city council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(d)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the requested rate increase, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(e)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed rate increase may request the city secretary to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing any time before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city secretary with the objector's name and address. 
(f)  Delay determination. If the city council is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the city council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the city council shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's finding, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new maximum monthly charges. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the city council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the city council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The city council's decision concerning the requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person requesting the city secretary to record the objection or may be submitted in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted. 
(j)  Refunds. 
(1)  The city council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments with interest if: 
a.  The city council was unable to make a decision within the extended time period as described in subsection (c) of this section; 
b.  The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of the extended review period; and 
c.  The city council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the city council disapproves any portion of the rate increase. 
(2)  The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city council's decision resolution. 
(k)  Appeal. The city council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. O-94-941,  3, 4-19-94) 
Sec. 26-69. - Cable operator information. 
(a)  City may require. 
(1)  In those cases where the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the city council may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  In cases where initial proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the city council may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting proprietary information to the city council may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. Any such request shall be submitted to the office of the city attorney to ensure compliance with V.T.C.A., Government Code ch. 552, the Open Records Act. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection shall not be considered. 
(c)  City council action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section will be acted upon by the city council. The city council will grant the request if the cable operator presents, by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the city council denies the request, the city council shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the city return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires, will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the city council, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(d)  Appeal. If the city council denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days of the city council's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(Ord. No. O-94-941,  4, 4-19-94) 
Sec. 26-70. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulations or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the city at least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The city shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the city makes no objection within 30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect. 
(Ord. No. O-94-941,  5, 4-19-94) 
Sec. 26-71. - Refunds; fine for noncompliance. 
(a)  Refunds. The city may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following circumstances: 
(1)  A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or 
(2)  The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city. 
(b)  Fines. If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order, the cable operator shall be subject to a fine as provided in section 1-6 for each day the cable operator fails to comply.

(e)  Assessment of expenses; lien. 
(1)  All expenses incurred by the city to abate high weeds, grass or uncultivated plants, including the cost of giving notice as required, shall initially be paid by the city and charged to the owner of the property. If the charge is not paid to the city within 30 days after billing, it will become a charge against the property and the city may file a lien upon the property. 
(2)  To obtain a lien upon the property, the city manager or his designee shall file a statement of expenses with the county clerk for the county in which the property is located. The lien statement shall state the name of the owner, if known, and the legal description of the property. The lien attaches upon the filing of the lien statement with the county clerk. 
(3)  The lien shall be security for the expenditures made and interest accruing at the rate of ten percent per annum on the amount due from the date of payment by the city. 
(4)  The lien is inferior only to: 
a.  Tax liens; and 
b.  Liens for street improvements. 
(5)  The city may bring a suit for foreclosure of the lien in the name of the city to recover the expenditures and interest due and in said suit the statement of expenses or a certified copy of the statement shall be prima facie proof for the expenses incurred by the municipality in doing the work or making the improvements. 
(f)  Penalty. An offense as defined under section 42-31 is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,000.00. Each separate occurrence of a violation or each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one-percent-annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed rate making has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. Also called the "Base flood." 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building, which has its lowest elevated floor, raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS). See "Flood elevation study." 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See definition of "Flooding." 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

b.  Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."

    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area. See "Area of special flood hazard." 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. O-09-1723,  1, 8-4-09) 
Sec. 50-29. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. O-09-1723,  1, 8-4-09) 
Sec. 50-30. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

DIVISION 2. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 50-51. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. O-09-1723,  1, 8-4-09) 
Sec. 50-52. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 50-32, subsection 50-39(8), or subsection 50-53(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in subsection 50-40(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exist of floodwaters. 
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this subsection (4) be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at two feet above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of subsection 50-40(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. O-09-1723,  1, 8-4-09) 
Sec. 50-53. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections 50-28, 50-29, and 50-30. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of section 50-33, section 50-40, and the provisions of this division. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 50-32 or subsection 50-39(8). 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. O-09-1723,  1, 8-4-09) 
Sec. 50-54. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-32, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 50-40 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. O-09-1723,  1, 8-4-09) 
Sec. 50-55. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-32, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulation, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. O-09-1723,  1, 8-4-09) 
Sec. 50-56. - Penalties for non compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this court order and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this court order by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this court order or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $2,000.00 for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day a violation occurs is a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(2)  Gravel streets or alleys. The ditch of a gravel street or alley shall be well tamped in six-inch layers to a point nine inches below the surface of the street, after which one foot of good road gravel will be tamped in until level with the surface of the existing street.

(c)  Any change of control of a noncertificated telecommunications provider shall constitute a transfer under this section. There shall be a rebuttable presumption of a change of control of a noncertificated telecommunications provider upon a change of 25 percent or greater in the ownership of such noncertificated telecommunications provider. Such a change in control shall be deemed a transfer that requires consent of the city.

Sec. 86-106. - Construction obligations. 
(a)  A person is subject to reasonable police power regulation of the city to manage its public rights-of-way in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of facilities in the public rights-of-way, pursuant to the city's rights as a custodian of public property based upon the city's historic rights under state and federal laws. Such regulations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  At the city's request, a person shall furnish the city accurate complete information relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance and repair of facilities performed by the person in the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A person may be required to place certain facilities within the public rights-of-way underground according to applicable city requirements absent a reasonable demonstration by the person that, in any special instance, this requirement is not reasonable or feasible nor equally applicable to other similar users of the public rights-of-way. 
(3)  A person shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all reasonable requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with the Texas Department of Transportation specifications on other significant users of the public rights-of-way. The city shall waive requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the person. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. A person shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(4)  A person must obtain a permit, as reasonably required by applicable city codes, prior to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation or maintenance of the persons facilities. A construction permit is not required for routine maintenance that does not require excavation of the public rights-of-way or which does not block traffic lanes or sidewalks during peak traffic periods between 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays, or for more than two hours during any non-peak traffic period. Once a permit is issued, person shall give to the city a minimum of 48 hours notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of the above listed activities on its facilities in, on or under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the person to request and obtain a permit from the city prior to performing any of the above listed activities in, on or over any public right-of-way, except in an emergency as provided for in subsection (11) below, will subject the person to a stop-work order from the city and enforcement action pursuant to the City's Code of Ordinances. If the person fails to act upon any permit within 90 calendar days of issuance, the permit shall become invalid, and the person will be required to obtain another permit. The city may, at its discretion, grant extensions of expired permits for good cause. 
(5)  When a person completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, exca-vation or other work, the person shall promptly restore the public rights-of-way in accordance with reasonable and applicable city requirements. A person shall replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base, irrigation system and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance, or repair of the person's facilities within 30 calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the time of the work, unless extended by the city for good cause. 
(6)  Upon failure of a person to perform any such repair or replacement work, and five days after written notice has been given by the city to the person, and in the event repairs have not been initiated during such five-day period, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been disturbed by the person, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the person will reimburse the city for the costs so incurred within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(7)  Should the city reasonably determine, within one year from the date of the completion of the repair work, that the surface, base, irrigation system or landscape treatment requires additional restoration work to meet existing standards of the city, a person shall perform such additional restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies as provided herein. 
(8)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in subsection (7), if the city determines that the failure of a person to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts, after emergency notice has been provided, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances and the person failed to respond within the reasonable time limit specified by the city. A person shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(9)  A person shall furnish the city with construction plans and maps showing the location and proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction at least five days before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way, unless otherwise approved by the city. A person may not begin construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing. 
(10)  If the city manager declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, a person shall remove or abate the person's facilities by the deadline provided in the city manager's request. The person and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of service. If the person, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the person, without paying compensation to the person and without the city incurring liability for damages. 
(11)  Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent harm to property or person (an emergency condition(s), a person may not excavate the pavement of a street or public rights-of-way without first complying with city requirements. The city manager or designee shall be notified as promptly as possible regarding work performed under such emergency conditions, and the person shall comply with the requirements of city standards for the restoration of the public rights-of-way. 
(12)  Within 90 days of completion of each new permitted section of a person's facilities, the person shall supply the city with a complete set of "as built" drawings for the segment in a format used in the ordinary course of business, but excluding customer specific, proprietary or confidential information and as reasonably prescribed by the city, and as allowed by law. The city may, at its discretion, accept in lieu of "as-built" drawings, any reasonable alternative which provides adequate information as to the location of facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(13)  The city may require reasonable bonding requirements of a person, as are required of other entities that place facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(14)  In determining whether any requirement under this section is unreasonable or unfeasible, the city manager or his/her designee shall consider, among other things, whether the requirement would subject the person or persons to an unreasonable increase in risk or service interruption, or to an unreasonable increase in liability for accidents, or to an unreasonable delay in construction or in availability of its services, or to any other unreasonable technical or economic burden. 
(Ord. No. O-99-1171,  6, 3-7-00) 
Sec. 86-107. - Conditions of public rights-of-way occupancy. 
(a)  In the exercise of governmental functions, the city has first priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way. The city reserves the right to lay sewer, gas, water, and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, and to do underground and overhead work, and attachments, restructuring or changes in aerial facilities in, across, along, over or under a public street, alley or public rights-of-way occupied by a person, and to change the curb, sidewalks or the grade of streets. 
(b)  The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among competing users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each user type, and to the extent the city can demonstrate that there is limited space available for additional users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law. 
(c)  If the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley, or public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the previously authorized user of the public rights-of-way. If the city closes or abandons a public right-of-way that contains a portion of a person's facilities, the city shall close or abandon such public right-of-way subject to the rights of the person. 
(d)  If the city gives written notice, a person shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of person's facilities that are in the public rights-of-way within 120 days, except in circumstances that require additional time as reasonably determined by the city based upon information provided by the person. For projects expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, change or relocate, the city will confer with person before determining the alterations to be required and the timing thereof. The city shall give notice whenever the city has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation of a city or other governmental public improvement in the public rights-of-way. This section shall not be construed to prevent a person's recovery of the cost of relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for relocation or removal, nor shall it be required if improvements are solely for beautification purposes without prior joint deliberation and agreement with person. 
(e)  If the person fails to relocate facilities in the time allowed by the city in this section, the person may be subject to liability to the city for such delay and as set forth in the City Codes or ordinance, now or hereafter enacted. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (D)[(f)], the city manager and a person may agree in writing to different time frames than those provided above if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change. 
(g)  A person may trim trees in or over the rights-of-way for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its facilities. All tree trimming shall be performed in accordance with guidelines established by the National Arborist Association and International Society of Arboriculture. Should the person, its contractor or agent, fail to remove such trimmings within 24 hours, the city may remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of a bill from the city, the person shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred within 30 working days. Person shall not be responsible for tree trimming or removal above the work required to maintain or restore utility service. 
(h)  A person shall temporarily remove, raise or lower its aerial facilities to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures, if the city gives written notice of no less than 48 hours. The expense of these temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting and benefiting from the temporary rearrangements. Person may require prepayment or prior posting of a bond from the party requesting the temporary move. 
(Ord. No. O-99-1171,  7, 3-7-00)

(a)  A person shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts reasonably prescribed by the city with an insurance company licensed to do business in the State of Texas acceptable to the city. A person shall furnish the city with proof of insurance at the time of the request for construction permits. The city reserves the right to review the insurance requirements and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the city manager determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims history of the industry or the person require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the State of Texas or letters written by the person in those instances where the state does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required herein. However, for the city to accept such letters the person must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the city, based on financial information requested by and furnished to the city. The city's current insurance requirements are described in Exhibit "A" attached hereto.* 
(b)  Person shall furnish, at no cost to the city, copies of certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required by this section to the city. The city may request the deletion, revision or modification of particular policy terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions, unless the policy provisions are established by a law or regulation binding the city, the person, or the underwriter. If the city requests a deletion, revision or modification, a person shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to accomplish the change. 
(c)  An insurance certificate shall contain the following required provisions: 
(1)  Name the City of Colleyville and its officers, employees, board members and elected representatives as additional insureds for all applicable coverage; 
(2)  Provide for 30 days notice to the city for cancellation, nonrenewal, or material change; and 
(3)  Provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the city manager by certified mail. 
(d)  Person shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the city manager. An insurance certificate obtained in compliance with this section is subject to city approval. The city may require the certificate to be changed to reflect changing liability limits. A person shall immediately advise the city attorney of actual or potential litigation that may develop and may affect an existing carrier's obligation to defend and indemnify. 
(e)  An insurer has no right of recovery against the city. The required insurance policies shall protect the person and the city. The insurance shall be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies. 
(f)  The policy clause "other insurance" shall not apply to the city if the city is an insured under the policy. 
(g)  The person shall pay premiums and assessments. A company, which issues an insurance policy, has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a person must provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the city in connection with damage covered by the policy.

Direct payment-Facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers: To the extent allowed by applicable state and federal law, any telecommunications service providers who purchase unbundled network elements or other facilities or services for the purpose of rebundling those facilities and/or services to create telecommunications service for sale to persons within the city ("rebundler"), must pay to the city the access line fee that is calculated as of month-end by applying the appropriate access line fee, as specified in section 91-31 above, to each access line created by rebundling telecommunications service or facilities. Direct payment further ensures that the access line fee imposed herein can be applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all telecommunications service providers that sell telecommunications service within the city. Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, the provider shall not include in its monthly count of access lines any facilities or services provided to other telecommunications service providers for rebundling into telecommunications service, if the telecommunications service provider who is rebundling those facilities for resale has provided a signed statement to the provider that the telecommunications service provider is paying the access line fees applicable to those rebundled services directly to the city. If provider provides a copy of the signed statement to the city from the rebundler which is acceptable to the city, then provider is absolved of all responsibility for the access line fees payable on the services, unbundled network facilities, and other facilities rebundled for the creation of telecommunications service for sale within the city by each such rebundler. 
2.  Indirect payments-Public rights-of-way fee application to use of network by others: With respect to any person leasing, reselling, or otherwise using a provider's access lines, if a provider believes it does not have sufficient information to determine the appropriate rate to apply, then the higher access line fee may be applied until such time as the person using the access lines provides to the provider sufficient written information to determine the correct access line fee. If a person provides sufficient written information for the application of the access line fee, provider may, at its discretion and not at the city's request, bill the person on the basis of the information provided. provider shall provide to the city any information regarding the locations to which it is providing service or facilities for use by another person for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers, so long as city first obtains written permission of such other person for provider to provide the information to the city. Any other provision of this chapter notwithstanding, however, a provider shall not be liable for underpayment of access line fees resulting from the provider's reliance upon the written information provided by any person who uses provider's services or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers.

(d)  A mortgage or other pledge of assets to a bank or lending institution in a bona fide lending transaction shall not be considered an assignment or transfer. 
(e)  Every municipal consent granted under this section 91-34 shall specify that any transfer or other disposition of rights which has the effect of circumventing payment of required access line fees or minimum fees and/or evasion of payment of such fees by failure to accurately count or report the number of access lines by a provider is prohibited. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything else in this section 91-34, if the city has not approved or denied a request to transfer under this section within 120 days of written notice of such request from the provider to the city, it shall be deemed approved. Such time frame may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.

ARTICLE III. - ROAD HUMP POLICY FOR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-94-968, adopted Oct. 18, 1994, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, codification of  1( 9A-G) of said ordinance as  94-71-94-77 herein was at the editor's discretion. See history note at the end of each section for derivation thereof. 

Sec. 94-71. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, as used in this section, shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:] 
    Application means the written initial request and the petition submitted by a resident or representative of a neighborhood group. 
    Residential dwellings include single-family houses, townhouses and duplexes. 
    Road hump is a geometric design feature of a roadway, consisting of a raised area in the roadway pavement surface extending transversely across the travelway, whose sole purpose is to reduce the speed of vehicles traveling along that roadway. 
    Street refers to the street segment that must be petitioned. It should be a continuous street between two intersecting streets and should be a minimum of 1,000 feet in length. 
(Ord. No. O-94-968,  1( 9A), 10-18-94) 
Sec. 94-72. - Eligibility requirements. 
    Many factors must be considered in locating road humps for optimal effectiveness. Isolated humps provide only point speed reductions and do not achieve an overall speed reduction effect. Site details should be the dominant consideration in determining the actual location for each road hump rather than an exact separation distance. All of the following criteria must be satisfied for a street to be considered eligible for road hump installation. 
(1)  A petition documenting that a minimum of 90 percent of the property owners of all residential dwellings on the street support installation of the requested road hump(s). 
(2)  The street where the road hump is proposed must be composed primarily of residential dwellings. 
(3)  Conditions for locating road humps, including operational and geometric characteristics of the street, are as follows: 
a.  The street must be a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
b.  The street must be paved. If the road hump is located on a street with no curb and gutter, then a special design must be used to prevent vehicles from driving around a road hump. 
c.  The street pavement width can be no wider than 36 feet wide. 
d.  There must be no more than one moving lane of traffic in each direction. 
e.  Traffic volumes must be more than 400 vehicles per day but less than 3,000 vehicles per day. 
f.  The street must not be identified as a primary route for emergencies vehicles. Primary emergency routes include, but are not limited to, the streets identified on maps available in the fire and police departments and are subject to change. 
g.  The street must have a speed limit of 30 miles per hour or less in accordance with state law. 
h.  Vehicle speed must equal or exceed an 85th percentile speed of five miles over the posted speed limit. 
i.  The street must have adequate sight distance to safely accommodate the hump(s) as determined by the public works and police departments. 
j.  The street must not have curves or grades that prevent safe placement of the hump(s). Road humps may be located on streets that contain curves and/or grades but the hump itself must be located not less than 200 feet from any horizontal curve with a radius of 1,000 feet or less. The vertical grade of the street may not exceed eight percent. 
k.  The elevation of property adjacent to a hump location must be above the top of the curb, or as determined by the engineering department, to minimize potential flooding due to the presence of the hump in the roadway. 
l.  A road hump must be located downstream of drainage inlets. 
m.  A road hump must be placed perpendicular to the direction of travel. 
n.  A road hump must not be installed within 150 feet of an intersection. 
o.  A road hump should be located on property lines rather than in front of a residence, however it must not be located in front of a property if the owner objects to its placement or, in the case of a property containing multiple dwellings, if a majority of the households on the property object to its placement. It is the responsibility of the applicant(s) to obtain approval from the property owner or majority of households to place road humps on property lines or in front of a residence. 
p.  A road hump should not be located at driveways or between ends of a loop driveway that presents an attractive run-around route. 
q.  A road hump must not be located over manholes, gate valves, utility vault accesses and similar features. 
r.  A road hump should be installed to take advantage of existing street lighting. 
(Ord. No. O-94-968,  1( 9B), 10-18-94) 
Sec. 94-73. - Cost of road humps. 
    Until further order of the city council by ordinance, the road hump price will be $650.00 per road hump, which includes asphalt, markings and signage. Special design features may result in additional costs. 
(Ord. No. O-94-968,  1( 9C), 10-18-94) 
Sec. 94-74. - Cost responsibility. 
    The cost for the road hump installation (including signs, pavement markings and, if necessary, special design features such as curbing or guard rail) and/or removal is the property owner's responsibility. The cost for transportation engineering studies and maintenance of the road hump is the responsibility of the city. The term property owner, when used in cost sharing, does not necessarily refer to the petitioners, but is used to define the share of the cost that is not the responsibility of the city and should be paid by one or more of the residents or from other private resources. The city council reserves the right to waive the cost in cases of financial hardship. 
(Ord. No. O-94-968,  1( 9D), 10-18-94) 
Sec. 94-75. - Design standards and procedures. 
    The city manager shall prepare and maintain current design standards and installation procedures for road humps in accordance with this article. 
(Ord. No. O-94-968,  1( 9E), 10-18-94) 
Sec. 94-76. - Procedure for road hump installation. 
(a)  The initial request for the installation of road humps must originate from the property owners living on the street. A request in writing from a property owner or representative of a neighborhood group must be forwarded to: 
Road Hump Program 
c/o Colleyville Police Department 
City of Colleyville 
P.O. Box 185 
Colleyville, Texas 76034 
(b)  Upon receipt of the request, a preliminary determination of eligibility based on compliance with this article and available traffic data will be made in a timely manner. 
(1)  If the street is determined not to be eligible, the applicant will be notified in writing of the reason for the denial. 
(2)  The decision may be appealed in writing to the city manager within 15 days of the notification date. The city manager will review the determination and respond to the applicant within 30 days of the appeal request. Any subsequent petitions must show the reason for the original denial. 
(3)  If the street is determined to be eligible for consideration of road hump installations, a meeting will be arranged between the applicant and staff to determine the petition area and the approximate road hump location range. The applicant will then be instructed to submit a petition containing the signatures of 90 percent of the property owners of all residential dwellings on the street in support of the installation of the road humps. Only petition forms (exhibit A) supplied by the city or photocopies of petition forms may be used for this purpose. 
(c)  Upon receipt of the petitions, the police department will verify the legitimacy of all signatures. Once the signatures have been verified, the police department will conduct the necessary studies and solicit comments and recommendations from other city departments. A determination of the street's eligibility for road hump installation will be made in a timely manner, based on the road hump ordinance. 
(1)  If the street is determined not to be eligible for road hump installation, the applicant will be notified in writing giving the reason. 
(2)  The decision may be appealed in the same manner as in subsection (b)(2) above. 
(3)  If the street is determined to be eligible, the street will be placed on a list of streets eligible for road hump installation. 
(d)  The city will make a determination of the total installation cost. 
(e)  Once placed on the eligible street list, all property owners on the street and all streets directly adjacent to it will be notified of the proposed action by the public works department. The notice will include a return form to indicate support or objection to the proposed installation. 
(f)  If owners of 20 percent or more of the real property (as measured by front footage) within the notification area object to the installation within 30 days of the notice, the street will then be removed from the list of streets eligible for road hump installation and a public hearing will be scheduled with the city council. The public works department will notify the applicant, the owners of all property within the study area and the area neighborhood associations of the public hearing. 
(g)  If objections from less than 20 percent of the real property owners within the notification area are received or the city council approves the installation after a public hearing, then the city will place the street on a list of streets approved for road hump installation. 
(h)  Once a street is placed on the list of streets approved for road hump installation, the city will submit a statement to the applicant for the cost of the road hump installation. Upon receipt of payment of the cost, the humps will be installed as scheduling permits. If full payment has not been received within six months from the statement date, the street will be removed from the list of streets approved for road hump installation and all monies received, if any, returned to the payor. 
(Ord. No. O-94-968,  1( 9F), 10-18-94) 
Sec. 94-77. - Removal/alteration. 
    The process for road hump removal or alteration by the property owners is the same as the process for installation. Ninety percent of the property owners of all residential dwellings on the street must sign a petition in favor of removal. The cost for removal or alteration will be determined by the city and is the property owners responsibility to pay.

Sec. 98-79. - Surcharge for wastes of abnormal strength. 
(a)  A normal service charge shall be established by the city for any person, firm, owner, or corporation discharging wastes into the system, provided that the BOD in the wastewater or the suspended materials does not exceed the normal concentration of 250 parts per million. 
(b)  When either the BOD or the suspended solids or both are found to exceed the stated 250 parts per million at the point entering the city's system, a surcharge shall be applied to the billing rate by multiplying the normal service base rate by the factor obtained from dividing the actual measured BOD by 250 and also by the factor obtained from dividing the actual measured suspended solids by 250, each such factor to be applied individually and only when greater than one. The surcharge will be made for each factor that exceeds one and shall be additive. 
(c)  The determination of BOD and suspended materials shall be by an independent laboratory selected by the city. The time of selection of the sample shall be at the sole discretion of the city. The applicable surcharge determined by such tests shall be retroactive for two billing periods and shall continue for six billing periods unless subsequent tests determine that the surcharge should be further increased. 
(d)  When any tests made at the discretion of the city pursuant to this division show that a surcharge shall be applied, continued or increased over the base rate, whichever is applicable, then the owner shall be billed at the rate of $5.00 for each test to cover the cost of sampling, mailing, and handling plus the laboratory fees. When a surcharge is in effect, the test will be made at least every 15 days. When such tests made at the discretion of the city reveal that the surcharge is no longer applicable, then no costs will be made to the owner for such tests.

Sec. 98-80. - Authority to disconnect service. 
    The city shall retain the right to disconnect waste disposal service in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Where acids or chemicals damaging to sewer lines or treatment processes are released to the sewer causing rapid deterioration of such structures or interfering with proper treatment of sewage, the city is authorized immediately to terminate service by such measures as are necessary to protect facilities. 
(2)  Where the city determines that an SIU is introducing prohibited waste into the sewage system, or that an SIU is violating its discharge permit, or that an SIU is introducing waste into the system without a discharge permit, or that an SIU has or is committing any other violation of this division, the city may immediately disconnect the SIU from the city sewer system. Further, where any governmental agency informs the city that the effluent from the treatment plant is no longer of the standard permitted for release into the watercourse and it is found that the owner is delivering wastewater to the city's system that cannot be sufficiently diluted by mixing with the city's waste or requires treatment that is not provided by the city as normal domestic treatment, the city shall so notify the owner and the city may disconnect the owner from the sewage system. The owner's waste treatment service shall remain disconnected until such time that the owner has complied with all of the provisions of this division and/or provided additional pretreatment facilities designed to remove the objectionable cause from the owner's industrial waste. No reconnection of the city sewage system shall be made until the owner has paid all costs of the original disconnection and for reconnection. 
(3)  Where the owner delivers his wastewater at an uncontrolled, variable rate in sufficient quantity that it causes an imbalance in the sewage treating system. 
(Code 1980, ch. 11,  2(E)) 
Sec. 98-81. - Revocation of permit. 
    Where the city determines that an SIU is introducing sewage into the city's sewage system in violation of its discharge permit, or that the SIU has given false information in its application for a permit, or determines that the SIU has given false information in its self-monitoring and reporting process, or that the SIU is in violation of any provision of this division, the city may revoke the SIU's discharger permit.

Sec. 98-307. - Emergency suspensions. 
    The utility superintendent or his designee may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The utility superintendent or his designee may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the utility superintendent or his designee or control authority may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The utility superintendent or his designee may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the utility superintendent or his designee that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 98-308 of this article are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the utility superintendent or his designee prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 98-303 or 98-308 of this article.

(Ord. No. O-03-1392,  1, 3-18-03) 
Sec. 98-325. - Applicability of more stringent regulations. 
(a)  [Applicability.] If national pretreatment standards, categorical or otherwise, more stringent than the discharge limits prescribed in this article are promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for certain industries, the more stringent national pretreatment standards will apply to the affected industrial user. A violation of the more stringent national pretreatment standards will also be considered a violation of this article. 
(b)  Applicability of more stringent discharge limits. An industrial user within the city who discharges industrial waste ultimately received and treated by another governmental entity pursuant to a wholesale wastewater contract or a reciprocal agreement with the city is subject to the following additional rules: 
(1)  If the governmental entity has more stringent discharge limits than those prescribed by this article, or by a discharge permit issued hereunder, because the United States Environmental Protection Agency requires the more stringent discharge limits as part of the governmental entity's wastewater pretreatment program, the more stringent discharge limits shall prevail. 
(2)  The utility superintendent or his designee is authorized to issue a discharge permit to an industrial user affected by subsection (1), to insure notice of and compliance with the more stringent discharge limits. If the industrial user already has a discharge permit, the utility superintendent or his designee may amend the permit to apply and enforce the more stringent discharge limits. An industrial user shall submit to the utility superintendent or his designee an expected compliance date and an installation schedule if the more stringent discharge limits necessitate technological or mechanical adjustments to discharge facilities or plant processes. 
(3)  If the utility superintendent or his designee chooses not to issue or amend a permit under subsection (2), the utility superintendent or his designee shall notify the affected industrial user in writing of the more stringent discharge limits and their effective date. Regardless of whether or not a permit is issued or amended, an industrial user shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comply with the more stringent discharge limits. 
(4)  The more stringent discharge limits cease to apply upon termination of the city's wholesale wastewater contract or reciprocal agreement with the governmental entity, or upon modification or elimination of the limits by the government entity or the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The utility superintendent or his designee shall take the appropriate action to notify the affected industrial user of an occurrence under this subsection (4). 
(c)  Variances in compliance dates. The utility superintendent or his designee may grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry when, in the utility superintendent or his designee's opinion, such action is necessary to achieve pretreatment or corrective measures. In no case shall the utility superintendent or his designee grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry affected by national categorical pretreatment standards beyond the compliance dates established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
(d)  Authority to regulate. The utility superintendent or his designee may establish regulations, not in conflict with this article other laws, to control the disposal and discharge of industrial waste into the wastewater system and to insure compliance with the city's pretreatment enforcement program with all applicable pretreatment regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The regulations established shall, where applicable, be made part of any discharge permit issued to an industrial user by the utility superintendent or his designee.

DIVISION 13. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 

Sec. 98-401. - In an action brought in federal court only-Upset provision. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c), below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the utility superintendent or his designee within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

(a)  An event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe is not a violation. 
(b)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. 
(c)  In the event that (a) and (b) above has been demonstrated the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.

Sec. 98-403. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the utility superintendent or his designee, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the utility superintendent or his designee of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The utility superintendent or his designee may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the utility superintendent or his designee may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The utility superintendent or his designee may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the utility superintendent or his designee determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

Sec. 98-451. - Pretreatment charges and fees. 
(a)  The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program which may include: 
(1)  Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications; 
(2)  Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
(3)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  Fees for filing appeals; and 
(5)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this ordinance and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the city. 
(6)  Fees for treating abnormal strength wastes. 
(7)  Fees incurred from an upset, bypass or unauthorized discharge. 
(b)  Surcharge. The city may surcharge industrial users for the treating of abnormal strength wastes. Water or wastes having 1) a five-day biochemical oxygen demand greater than 250 parts per million (ppm) by weight or two) containing more than 250 parts per million by weight of total suspended solids shall be subject to the review and approval of the utility superintendent or his designee. Where the utility superintendent or his designee has approved the admission of (1) or (2) above into the POTW, that discharge may be subject to a surcharge as determined by the utility superintendent or his designee. In no case shall a discharge be accepted that will prevent the POTW from meeting its limits. 
    The surcharge will be assessed according to the following formula each month using the most current pollutant concentration data and the current months' wastewater flow: 
Surcharge = Q/1,000,000  [a(BOD - x) + b(TSS - y)][8.34] 
Where: 
Q = flow in gallons 
8.34 = weight in pounds of one gallon of water 
x = normal limits of BOD in domestic wastewater expressed in milligrams per liter 
y = normal limits of TSS in domestic wastewater expressed in milligrams per liter 
a = unit cost of treatment per pound of BOD 
b = unit cost of treatment per pound of TSS 
BOD = measured amount of BOD, in mg/l 
TSS = measured amount of TSS, in mg/l 
A surcharge is an additional charge by the POTW for the increased cost of handling discharge of unusual strength and character and shall not serve as a variance to the requirements of this ordinance. Exercise of this provision shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

    Water service line is defined as that portion of the service connection located in the roadway, street, alley or easement, which conveys water from a distribution main to the service meter or customer's curb stop, located on the customer's property line, but not longer than 100 feet from the distribution main. 
In no event shall the service line, as constructed by the city or under contract for the city, extend onto private property without a written easement granted by the property owner to the city. All water service lines shall be installed by the city's forces or under contracts executed by the city. 
    Water supply source is defined as the origin, either singular or plural, of the water supply for the entire distribution system, or any part thereof.

(See exhibit A [of Ordinance No. O-98-1133]: Std. Detail No. 7:01-1, "Reduced Pressure Principal Large Assembly," Std. Detail No. 7:01-2, "Relief Valve Discharge Rates," Std. Detail No. 7:01-3, "Strainers," and Std. Detail No. 7:01-4, "Reduced Pressure Principal Small Assembly.") 
(1)  RP's may be utilized at premises where a substance is handled that would be hazardous to the public health if introduced into the potable water system. An RP is normally used in locations where an air gap is impractical. An RP is effective against both backsiphonage and backpressure. 
(2)  RP's shall be sized to provide an adequate supply of water and pressure for the premises being served. 
(3)  Premises where non-interruption of water supply is critical shall be provided with two assemblies of the same type installed in parallel. They shall be sized in such a manner that either assembly will provide the minimum water requirements while the two together will provide the maximum flow required. 
(4)  Bypass lines are prohibited. Pipefittings that could be used for connecting a bypass line shall not be installed. 
(5)  The assembly shall be readily accessible for testing and maintenance and shall be located in an area where water damage to buildings or furnishings will not occur from relief valve discharge. An approved air gap funnel assembly may be used to direct minor discharges away from the assembly; this assembly will not control flow in a continuous relief situation. Drain lines to accommodate full relief valve discharge flow should be considered. 
(6)  Enclosures shall be designed for ready access and sized to allow for the minimum clearances established below. Daylight drain ports shall be provided to accommodate full pressure discharge from the assembly. 
(7)  All assemblies larger than two inches shall have a minimum of 12 inches on the back side, 24 inches on the test cock side, and the relief valve opening shall be at least 12 inches plus nominal size of assembly above the floor or highest possible water level. Headroom of six feet is required in vaults without a fully removable top. A minimum access opening of 24 inches square is required on all vault lids. All assemblies two inches and smaller shall have at least a six inch clearance on all sides. 
(8)  All RP assemblies shall be tested in accordance with this ordinance. 
(9)  Variances from these specifications will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Any deviations shall be prohibited without prior written approval of the city manager or his designee. 
(10)  RP assemblies may be installed in a vault only if relief valve discharge can be drained to daylight through a boresight type drain. The drain shall be of adequate capacity to carry the full rated flow of the assembly and shall be screened on both ends. 
(11)  An approved air gap shall be located at the relief valve orifice of RP assemblies. This air gap shall be at least twice the inside diameter of the incoming supply line as measured vertically above the top rim of the drain and in no case less than one inch.

The city does not commit to a policy of funding system extensions from surplus revenues, bond funds or other public sources of funds; however, in the event such funds become available, the city reserves the right to do so at its sole discretion. In such cases, priority of projects will be based upon the well-being of the public relative to health and sanitation, as well as the willingness of the customers involved to participate in the cost. 
Sec. B. - Method of procedure. 
    Where one or more single customer(s) desires to advance the funding necessary for the city to extend either its water or sewer systems, or both, to satisfy the requirements for points of service for their property, they shall make the request to the city secretary in writing, stating the lot and block number, name of subdivision and street address of the property to be served and the type or types of service required. Each request shall be signed by all property owners initially requesting service and their signatures shall be identified with the property they desire to be served. 
Upon receipt of such request, the city secretary will instruct the city's engineer(s) to prepare an estimate of the cost of the extension to satisfy the requested point of service, which shall include the actual cost of construction, together with the cost of the repair of all streets and other public utilities required by the construction. 
The estimated amount of construction as determined above for extending the distribution mains, lateral sewers or sewer mains for the requesting customer(s), plus the meter deposit prescribed for each of the initial customers requiring the extension as set forth in section 4, shall be deposited with the city by the individuals in proportions determined as hereinafter provided before construction is initiated by the city. The city shall pay for the engineering, administration, field surveys and other contingencies. 
Each single customer participating in the system extensions under this section of the city's policies shall execute a written agreement with the city setting forth in detail the location, extent, total and single customer cost of the extensions, and the name and address of the person to whom refunds are payable. 
After all required deposits are posted with the city, the applicants may stipulate that competitive bids be received from private contractors for performing the extensions, otherwise it will be left to the option of the city whether the work is to be let by competitive bids or performed by the city forces for the amount of the estimate. 
If bids are received on the work, the amounts of the deposit will be adjusted by additional collections or refunds to the actual contract cost plus the applicable meter deposits. Such adjustments shall be made upon the completion of the work and prior to connecting the customer for service. 
Sec. C. - Determination of proportions of extension charges assigned to respective individuals participating in extensions by groups. 
    Where groups of single customers join together to accomplish system extensions for service provided above, the proportion of the cost assigned to each participating customer shall be determined as follows: 
1.  The participating customer's cost shall be computed as follows: The individual customer's front footage divided by the summation of all the participating customers' front footages receiving point of service by the extension project multiplied times [multiplied by] the total cost of street repairs, other repairs and appurtenances. 
2.  In addition to the extension costs thus determined, the customers shall also pay the meter deposits provided for in section 4 and provide their own sewer service line and/or water connection to the meter. In the event an individual has prepaid to the city the sewer service connection fee pursuant to the policy established by the city heretofore, the city shall pay that individual's share of the participant's total extension cost. 
Sec. D. - Subsequent connections to extensions paid for by single customers or groups of single customers. 
    As intermediate customers between the last previous point of service and the extended point of service request and pay the standard connection charges plus extension charges as required to satisfy the intermediate customer's point of service requirement, refunds will be made to the customers who paid for the extension until the full amount advanced to the city for the extension has been repaid. Refunds shall be made to the initial customer within 30 days after the new customer connection charges have been paid to the city, and shall be divided among the initial participants in the same proportion as their participation in the extension. 
No refunds will be made five years after the construction of the extension project has been completed, nor shall refunds of less than $25.00 per participating customer be made. 
(Ord. No. O-86-618, 6-24-86) 
Sec. E. - Alternate extension procedure available to permit the extension of sanitary sewer main(s) to serve existing residences. 
    The city may extend sanitary sewers to service new areas previously not served when the city determines that such extension is in the best interest of the public and the city. 
1.  Conditional requirements. The city may require as a condition the following: 
a.  A petition signed and submitted by 60 percent of the property owners requesting sewer service; and/or 
b.  Acceptable binding commitments and/or deposit(s) of funds sufficient to pay for 60 percent of the extension costs (as estimated by the city's consulting engineer) before authorization of the extension. 
2.  Access charges. Access fees will be charged as follows: 
a.  Per tap available to all properties affected by the line extension and not otherwise served by sanitary sewer, limited to one tap per platted lot or tract. 
b.  Per tap access fee shall be computed by one of the following two methods: 
i.  Ten dollars per front foot (as defined in section 1 hereof for "front footage") and as may be revised hereafter by resolution necessary to address changes in construction costs. 
Provided further, that the front footage fee shall not be less than $1,000.00 nor more than $2,000.00. Additional taps for system access requested after the original computation as determined herein shall be the same as would have been charged otherwise. 
ii.  Where lots are uniform in front footage and the equity of the individual case indicates that a single fee may be the most appropriate and efficient method of assessment, the city council may act to adopt a per tap access fee based on an equal distribution of cost to be assessed to property owners for the extension project. 
The formula per tap access fee shall be the number of "front footage(s)" times $10.00 divided by the number of lots or tracts abutting the sewer line. 
No. of front footage(s)  $10.00 
Total no. of lots/tracts    =  Per tap 
access fee  
iii.  Where the per tap access fee computed under part (i) hereof would exceed $1,500.00, the city council may in lieu of charging [the] access fee provided for in part (i) hereof, establish a fee of $1,500.00, regardless of the additional cost necessary to serve the property in question. 
(Ord. No. O-94-946,  1, 5-3-94) 
c.  Subsequent additional taps within the line extension limits shall be charged the same access fees as apply to those initially receiving sewer service as a result of a sewer extension. 
3.  Payment Method. Customers shall be required to pay their per tap access fee, in full, prior to connecting the customer's service line to the city sewer main unless otherwise allowed as provided for herein. 
Customers unable to pay in full prior to accessing the city's sewer main may be allowed to pay out their access charge when: 
a.  An application for such payment method is completed and submitted on forms provided and approved by the city manager or his designee; 
b.  An interest charge of 91/2 percent per annum shall be charged for the payment period required; 
c.  Maximum payment period offered shall be 60 months; and 
d.  The city reserves the option under such approved time payment method to bill with utility bills, by separate statement, or with authorized bank drafts executed by the sewer customers. 
Provided, further, that the city manager is authorized to waive and/or revise payment methods in case of financial hardship when adequate verification of need is provided. 
(Ord. No. O-89-721, 7-25-89) 
SECTION 6. - SYSTEM EXTENSIONS TO SERVE SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENTS 

Sec. A. - Basic policy and scope of charges. 
    The developer shall pay all costs attributable to the installation of water and sewerage facilities as needed to fulfill the basic criteria requirements of the city for service to his subdivision. Such costs generally include (but [are] not limited to) the following: 
1.  For easements, rights-of-way and sites, the total actual cost of acquisition unless the city council approves city participation as specifically provided in the developer-city agreement because of common usefulness for other functions of the city. 
2.  For engineering design and construction contract administration: 
a.  When city participation does not exceed $5,000.00: The total actual cost. 
b.  When city participation exceeds $5,000.00: The developer shall pay his proportional share of the cost. 
3.  When city participation does not exceed $5,000.00: For city review of construction plans, an amount equal to two percent of the construction cost or $500.00, whichever is greater. 
4.  For construction of facilities, the total actual cost unless the city council approves city participation for oversizing as specifically provided in the developer-city agreement. 
5.  For city inspection and acceptance fees, an amount equal to three percent of the construction cost. 
6.  For construction layout, cut sheets and for making field adjustments: 
a.  When city participation does not exceed $5,000.00: The total actual cost. 
b.  When city participation exceeds $5,000.00: The developer shall pay his proportional share of the cost. 
7.  Any fees, licenses or other mandatory costs assessed by others not within control of city shall be fully paid by developer. 
All subdivision extensions shall be covered by a written and executed agreement of form prepared or approved by the city's legal counsel which defines the scope and details of the proposed extension and particularly contains the developer's agreement to abide by all regulations of the city and to deliver to the city clear and unencumbered title to all the proposed improvements at the time of acceptance by the city, which must be prior to commencing service. 
The city shall participate in the cost of subdivision extensions only where and to the extent that oversized facilities in addition to the subdivision needs are required for the proper overall benefit of the system and when city funds for such oversizing are available. Such oversizing needs shall be determined by the city's engineer(s) with concurrence of the superintendent, and shall be authorized and included in the developer-city agreement only by approval of the city council. 
In all cases when the city's participation in the cost of facilities is more than $5,000.00, the city's engineer(s) will provide engineering design and construction contract administration, construction layout, cut sheets and make any required field adjustments. The developer shall deposit with the city his share of such engineering cost attributable to his proportional share of the construction cost as particularly detailed in the developer-city agreement. 
When the city participates in the cost of constructing the project by oversizing facilities, or other participation, the contract for construction shall be executed between the city and the contractor only after compliance with all Charter and statutory requirements for advertising and receiving competitive bids. When the city does not participate in the construction costs of the project, the developer may negotiate the unit prices and completion time with the contractor(s) of his choice, or, by mutual agreement of the developer and the city, sealed bids may be received. In either event, the contract shall be executed between the city and the contractor and in compliance with section 7 following. 
Refunds to the developer shall be made only on applicable situations involving connections to off-site facilities (approach mains) or boundary facilities, and then only when provisions for such refunds are specifically provided for in the city-developer contract executed prior to construction of the extensions. 
Sec. B. - Methods of procedure. 
    Preliminary action is first initiated by the developer receiving and acknowledging receipt of a copy of the city's policies and procedures. Developer then has his engineer prepare and submit to the director of public works a preliminary layout of proposed water and sewer extensions superimposed on an approved preliminary plat signed by the city, along with his tentative estimate of costs for the overall development for the first section if incremental development is proposed. The developer also submits the city's review fee of two percent based upon the tentative cost estimate, or $500.00, whichever is greater. 
After review by the fire chief, the director of public works forwards the material to the city's engineer(s) for review. City's engineer(s) review the proposed preliminary layout and returns to the city with comments and recommendations concerning acceptability, needed oversizing and cost estimates for the oversizing. 
Developer will not proceed beyond the preliminary planning stage for any portion of the project for which he proposes to request city participation and, in no event, will the city participate more than $5,000.00 in any portion of the project that is not designed by the city's engineer(s) and submitted for competitive bids in accordance with all city Charter and statutory requirements. 
Action toward the filing and improving of all or a portion of development covered by preliminary action as per above is initiated by the developer as follows: 
1.  When city participation in the cost of the project does not exceed $5,000.00. The city furnishes the developer with three blank forms of the standard city-developer agreement. Developer's engineer shall prepare and submit to the city complete construction plans, specifications and other necessary contract documents along with estimates of developer's cost and two blue line prints of the final plat showing approval signature for the City of Colleyville. Such documents shall be submitted to the city's engineer(s) for review and after they have been fully completed and are acceptable and approved by the city council, the city shall return them to developer with notice of approval in exchange for the executed city-developer agreement and the remaining three percent of the city's total fee of five percent based upon the final engineer's estimate of the construction cost. 
If contract is to be let for bid, the developer's engineer prepares and furnishes to the city a notice to bidders to be properly published with bids to be addressed to the city manager and received at the Colleyville city hall. 
After selection of the contractor has been accomplished by bids or negotiation as per above, the actual construction shall be accomplished as follows: 
If bids are received, developer's engineer receives and recommends award to city manager. If contract is negotiated, developer advises who is contractor and furnishes bid amounts. City manager or director of public works notifies developer to have documents executed and returned to city. After receipt of executed documents, city manager issues work order. 
After the work order is issued, the developer's engineer provides the construction layout, staking and prepares cut sheets for all sewers. A copy of all cut sheets shall be furnished to the director or inspector and the contractor. 
The inspector shall inspect the work and review the partial and final pay estimates to the contractor as prepared by the developer's engineer. After pay estimates have been agreed upon by the inspector and the contractor, they shall be transmitted to the director of public works for checking. 
The director of public works shall check all pay estimates and, after they are in order, shall transmit them to the city manager with recommendation for payment or corrections as noted. 
After final completion of the work to the satisfaction of the inspector and director of public works, the city manager shall issue a statement of acceptance of the facilities for ownership and operation by the city to the developer. 
2.  When there is to be more than $5,000.00 city participation in the project. The city furnishes the developer with three blank forms of the standard city-developer agreement. After developer-city agreement has been executed and the proper fees have been deposited with the city, the city instructs the city's engineer(s) to proceed with preparation of construction plans and documents and the advertising and receiving of bids. 
After selection of the contractor has been accomplished by bids, the actual construction shall be accomplished as follows: 
The city's engineer(s) shall furnish to the city secretary a tabulation of all bids. 
After deposit or other approved financing is arranged for the developer's share of the cost and developer has furnished volume and page where plat is filed of record, the city secretary advises the city's engineer(s) with instructions to have documents executed and issue the work order. 
City's engineer(s) then has documents executed and furnishes copies of the documents and work order to city secretary, developer, contractor and surety. 
After distribution of documents, developer shall deposit with city secretary three percent layout and administration, plus three percent inspection and acceptance fees based upon developer's proportional share of the construction cost. 
Work order is then issued by the city's engineer(s), who also provides the construction layout staking and prepares cut sheets. A copy of all cut sheets shall be furnished to the city's superintendent and the contractor. 
The city's director of public works or inspector shall inspect the work and prepare or check the partial and final pay estimates to the contractor. 
After pay estimates have been agreed upon by the director of public works, inspector and the contractor, they shall be transmitted to the city's engineer(s) for checking. 
The city's engineer(s) shall check all pay estimates and, after they are in order, shall transmit them to the city secretary with recommendation for payment. 
After final completion of the work to the satisfaction of the superintendent or inspector, he shall prepare a statement of acceptance of the facilities for ownership and operation by the city, which shall be received for comment by the city engineer(s) and forwarded to the city council for final action. 
Sec. C. - Evaluated prices. 
    When the city participates in the cost of facilities for oversizing or for any other reason, separate bid items shall be set up to reflect the cost to the city when such separate items can be feasibly determined. In the absence of such specific bid prices, the price shall be determined by using a current bid price or city engineer(s) estimated price. 
Sec. D. - Developer payments. 
    When any extension or improvement to the water and/or sewerage system is to be installed under contract between the city and a contractor, the cost of which is to be paid wholly or partially by a developer, the contractor shall not be authorized to commence work until after the city has received the full amount due from the developer, either in cash to be placed in escrow or by irrevocable commercial letter of credit from a bank or other lending agency acceptable to the city, and conditions of such letter to be included in the city's developer agreement and of form approved by the city attorney. 
Sec. E. - Charges and/or refunds on off-site and boundary facilities. 
    When any customer, whether an individual, residential [or] commercial builder, developer or any other person, desires a service connection direct to an existing water or sewer line that was previously installed as a boundary or off-site facility of an extension serving another development or other individuals, the charges for each such connection to the line shall be assessed in accordance with the terms of the preceding section 4.A and 4.B. 
When a developer installs off-site or boundary facilities in which the city does not participate in the cost in any way, such developer shall become eligible for refunds from future connections to these facilities by fully identifying in the city-developer agreement the line location and extent of such boundary or off-site facilities. Such refunds shall be made only from the connection charges as they are paid by customers not within the platted area of development covered by the agreement. The determination of such refunds shall be made by the same formula as set up in preceding section 5.D. 
When portions of an increment of a development necessitates facilities that are boundary or off-site relative to the initial increment, but later furnished direct service to subsequent increments, then such later connections may be made without payment of additional connection charges by the same developer or his legal heirs, assigns, successors, or executors; however, if the subsequent development is by others, then connection charges will be assessed and refunds to the original developer will be made if so provided in his city-developer agreement. 
(Ord. No. O-77-252, 6-21-77)

1. The Administrative Official shall refer the question concerning any new or unlisted use to the Planning and Zoning Commission requesting an interpretation as to the proper zoning classification into which such use should be placed.

Section 3.7  Non-conforming Uses, Lots and Buildings
A. Intent  Within the districts established by this Chapter, or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots and uses of land, buildings and structures, uses of land and buildings in combination, and characteristics of use which were lawful before the original zoning ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Chapter or future
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 3 - Land Use Page 3 - 4
amendment. It is the intent of this Chapter to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Chapter that such non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as ground for adding other buildings and structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
Non-conforming uses are declared by this Chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of a building or structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a non-conforming use of buildings and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Chapter by attachment on a building or premises or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.

Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the City Council per Chapter 1, Section 1.13.D and Sections 1.16.E.
C. Non-conforming Uses of Land (or Land with Minor Building Only)  Where at the time of passage of this Chapter lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Chapter, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
1. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the original zoning ordinance;
2. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the same lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption of amendment of the original zoning ordinance:
3. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than ninety (90) consecutive days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land is located;
4. No additional building not conforming to the requirements of this Chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
D. Non-conforming Buildings  Where a lawful building exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter that could not be built under the terms of this Chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the building, such building may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No such non-conforming building may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any building or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity or to
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 3 - Land Use Page 3 - 5
comply with City building codes.
2. Should such non-conforming building or non-conforming portion of a building be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction; it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Chapter, or when approved by the City Council per Section 1.13.C, after public hearing thereon, when the Councils findings, having due regard for the property rights of persons affected, were considered in the light of public welfare and the character of the area surrounding the nonconforming building and the conservation and protection of property.
3. Should such building be moved for any reason any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved.
E. Non-conforming Uses of Buildings or of Buildings and Premises in Combination  If lawful use involving individual buildings with a replacement cost of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more, or of buildings and premises in combination, exist at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter that would not be allowed in a particular district under the terms of this Chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No existing building devoted to a use not permitted by this Chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the building to a use permitted in the district in which it is located, or to comply with City building codes.
2. Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
3. If no structural alterations are made, except as required by the Citys building codes, any non-conforming use of a building, or building and premises, may, as a waiver, be changed to another non-conforming use provided that the City Council, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change, the City Council may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this Chapter.
4. Any building, or building and land in combination, in or on which a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
5.

A. Purpose - The purpose of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) is to provide for greater flexibility and discretion in the approval of residential, non-residential and mixed use developments by encouraging creative, efficient and aesthetically desirable residential and commercial projects that are superior to what could be accomplished in other zoning districts through the use of increased open spaces, greenbelts, or by providing enhanced amenities or features within the development that will be of special benefit to the property owners or to the community.
B. Ordinance Required and Effect on Official Zoning Map  Every Planned Unit Development approved under the provisions of this section shall be considered an amendment to the Land Development Code and Official Zoning Map of the City of Colleyville, Texas. In approving any request for a Planned Unit Development district, the City Council shall, upon recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, incorporate in the approving ordinance reference the approved site plan, supporting documents and include other conditions or restrictions imposed on the project by the Commission, including those of the Council. The approval and adoption of the amending ordinance by the City Council shall result in the appropriate change to the Official Zoning Map.
C. General Development Standards  The standards and requirements set forth in the Land Development Code shall be applicable to every Planned Unit Development, except where a new or different standard or requirement has been set forth in the ordinance establishing the PUD district. Such standards or requirements may be in addition to or in lieu of a development standard contained in the Land Development Code. The ordinance creating the Planned Unit Development may establish these requirements specifically in the ordinance or by reference to another zoning district.
D. Classification of Planned Unit Developments  The approving ordinance establishing a Planned Unit Development shall include one of the following classifications, which shall also be shown on the Official Zoning Map using the applicable letter symbol.

Planned developments containing primarily non-residential uses, such as commercial, office, professional services, retail, institutional and industrial uses, or combinations thereof, shall be classified as Planned Unit Development  Commercial. A PUD-C may also contain a portion of residential uses.
E. Permitted Uses  The uses permitted in a Planned Unit Development shall be enumerated in the approving ordinance with land use descriptions consistent with the Table of Permitted Uses, contained elsewhere in this Land Development Code. A Planned Unit Development may allow a combination of land uses, a specific use, or a class of generic uses, such as single family residential, office, retail, commercial or educational facilities, or a reference to another zoning district.
F. Prohibited Uses  Uses not expressly permitted in the ordinance approving the Planned Unit Development shall be prohibited.
G. Maximum Residential Density  The maximum residential density permitted in a PUD-R district, or in a

All conditions imposed by the City Council shall be complied with prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
5. Revocation Upon Failure to Develop  A special use permit approved by the Council shall become null and void one year from the date of approval by the City Council unless a building permit or certificate of occupancy, whichever is applicable, has been obtained on the property within said one year period. The City Council may in its adopting ordinance, shorten or lengthen the time in which a building permit or certificate of occupancy must be issued in order to preserve the special use permit. Any Special Use Permit in existence upon the passage of this ordinance shall become null and void one year after the passage of this ordinance, unless a building permit or certificate of occupancy, whichever is applicable, has been issued within said year.
Exception: The ordinance authorizing a Special Use Permit may provide for an alternate expiration period.
6.

Section 5.7 Tree Preservation and Canopy Cover
All new development and redevelopment, to include additions, shall provide a minimum site tree canopy coverage per this Section through preservation of existing trees on the same site and establishment of new trees on the same site.
A. Calculation of Tree Canopy:
1. The canopy area for each existing Protected Tree shall be assumed as a circle having a radius in feet equal to the DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) in inches of that tree. Example: A 10 inch DBH tree would have a canopy diameter of 20 feet and a canopy area of 314 square feet.
2. Protected Tree. A Protected Tree is defined as a woody perennial plant which has attained a DBH of six (6) inches or more and has an overall height of at least fifteen (15) feet. Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), Hackberry/Sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), Chinese Tallow (Triadica sebifera), Hercules Club (Zanthoxylum clava-herculis), Honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos), Osage Orange (Maclura pomifera), Callery Pear (Pyrus calleryana), Chinaberry (Melia azedarach), Eastern Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) less than 18 inches DBH, and Eastern Redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) less than 13 inches DBH are excluded from this category and are considered Non-Protected Trees. Any Non-Protected tree used as a replacement (mitigation) tree or as a required tree on a commercial landscape plan shall require replacement (if removed) with a tree or trees that meet the caliper or canopy requirements for that lot, land use, or district.
Page 5-3
3. The canopy area for each new tree shall be credited based on the categories of large, medium, and small canopy trees: Large  2,000 sq. ft.; Medium  1,000 sq. ft.; Small  100 sq. ft. The Administrative Official shall develop, update, and maintain on file a list of tree species and their associated size category and canopy credit.
B. Non-single-family residential uses:
1. Preservation of a minimum of 50% of the Protected Tree Canopy outside the Commercial Building Envelope (building footprint plus a five (5) foot buffer) shall be required.
2. In addition to the minimum tree preservation as required in #1, provision of a minimum of 50% site tree canopy coverage on the lot outside the Commercial Building Envelope (building footprint plus a five (5) foot buffer) shall be required. This is accomplished through the preservation of existing trees and/or the supplemental planting of new trees per the tree planting credit in Paragraph A above. See appendix A for examples.
C. Development or redevelopment of single-family residential uses on individual lots or tracts:
1. Preservation of a minimum of 50% of the Protected Tree Canopy outside the Residential Building Envelope (building footprint plus a ten (10) foot buffer) shall be required.
2. In addition to the minimum tree preservation as required in #1, provision of a minimum of 50% site tree canopy coverage on the lot outside the Residential Building Envelope (building footprint plus a ten (10) foot buffer) shall be required. This is accomplished through preservation of existing trees and/or the supplemental planting of new trees per the tree planting credit in Paragraph A above. See appendix A for examples.
D. Additions and expansions to existing single-family residential uses on individual lots or tracts:
1. When an addition or expansion to the footprint of a single-family residence equals 50% or more of the existing footprint, the regulations per Paragraph C above shall apply.
E. Development of new single-family residential subdivisions:
1. Preservation of a minimum of 50% of the Protected Tree Canopy on the entire subdivision shall be required. The calculation shall include Protected trees located in newly dedicated streets (public or private), public water, sanitary sewer, gas, electric, telecommunication, drainage and general utility easements. The calculation shall exclude trees located in existing public utility easements containing existing in-service water, sanitary sewer, gas, electric, or telecommunication installations as well as additional public street right-of-way dedicated adjacent to an existing public or private street. The purpose of not excluding trees in new streets and easements is to promote subdivision design and layout that prioritize preservation of trees.
2. Within the required primary building setback areas (non-buildable areas for primary structure), a minimum of 75% of the Protected Tree Canopy shall be preserved. This is a separate calculation from that in Paragraph E.1.
3. Once the subdivision is constructed, all improvements are accepted by the City, the Administrative Official has inspected and verified compliance with required tree preservation, and Community Development has issued a letter of acceptance allowing submittal of new single-family building permits, then the preservation requirements of Paragraph C shall apply and each lot will be reviewed separately for tree preservation and planting based on that lots remaining trees and proposed location of single-family home.
Page 5-4
F. Artificial Lots:
1. When more than 50% of a lot or tract being developed or redeveloped is to remain untouched by tree removal, grading, excavation, filling, paving, or building, then an artificial lot may be delineated around the portion being developed and serve as the basis for calculation of tree canopy preservation and coverage. The delineation should not leave small strips or gaps adjacent to property lines and should generally only leave out one side of a property. Review and pre-approval of delineation for artificial lots shall be required.
G. Dead, Declining, and Hazardous Trees:
1. Any tree that the Administrative Official determines to be dead, declining beyond reasonable recovery effort, or that has a high or extreme hazard rating based on the ISA Basic Tree Risk Assessment that cannot be mitigated to a lower risk, shall be exempt from inclusion in the review of tree preservation and canopy cover calculation.

Section 6.7 Non-Residential Outdoor Lighting Requirements
A. Purpose
Efficient and effective outdoor night lighting benefits everyone and enhances the City's nighttime character. New lighting technologies have produced lights that are extremely powerful, and these types of lights may be improperly installed so that they create problems of excessive glare and light trespass that reduce residents' privacy. Excessive glare can be annoying or hazardous and may cause safety problems. There is a need for lighting requirements that recognize the benefits of efficient and effective outdoor lighting and provides clear guidelines for its installation so as to help maintain and complement the City's character and which strives to provide linkage between the built and natural environment and acknowledges and sustains the unique nature of the City's corporate-commercial, suburban and rural lifestyles. Appropriately regulated, and properly installed, outdoor lighting will contribute to the safety and welfare of the residents of the City.
B. Objectives
Outdoor lighting for nonresidential uses and multifamily uses has the following objectives:
1. It is intended to reduce the problems created by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting in those areas zoned for nonresidential uses and multifamily uses;

Section 8  135 Procedure for Approval of Subdivisions
A. Time Period for Taking Action  The approving body shall approve or disapprove a subdivision application within thirty (30) days after the date the subdivision application is filed as provided in this Chapter. A subdivision application is considered approved if the approving body fails to act on a plat within the prescribed period. Provided however, that the subdivider may request a deferral of action on the subdivision application, thereby waiving the thirty day time period for action by the approving body, provided said request is submitted in writing.
B. Additional Time Period for City Council Approval  Where City Council action is required or requested on a subdivision application as provided in this Chapter, the action shall be taken no later than thirty (30) days after the date the subdivision application was considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission. A subdivision is considered approved if the City Council fails to act on a plat within the prescribed period. Provided however, that the subdivider may request a deferral of action on the subdivision application, thereby waiving the thirty day time period for action by the City Council, provided said request is submitted in writing.
C. Certificate of Compliance  In cases where the City fails to act on a subdivision application within the thirty day time period, the Community Development Director, upon written request, shall issue a certificate of compliance stating the date the subdivision was filed and that the City failed to act on the subdivision application within the specified time.
D. Authorization to Sign Plats  The approval of a plat by the approving body, shall constitute authority for the, Community Development Director or, the Chairman and Secretary of the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the Mayor and City Secretary, to execute said plat, and shall constitute approval for recording in the County Clerks Office of Tarrant County.
E. Modification of Conditions  Where the approving body finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve modifications of conditions to these platting regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Such a finding by the City shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these platting regulations.
F. Completeness Determination  Every subdivision plat application shall be subject to a determination of completeness by the Administrative Official as provided for in this Section.
1. No later than the tenth business day from the date the application is received, the Administrative Official shall make a written determination that all documents required by the Land Development Code for a subdivision plat submittal have been received.
2. The applicant shall be provided written notice of any deficient documents no later than ten (10) business days from the date the application is received. The determination shall specify the documents or other information needed to complete the application and shall state the date the application will expire if the documents or other information are not provided. For purposes of this Section, the applicant shall be deemed to have been notified if the City has mailed a copy of the determination as provided herein.
3. The processing of an application by any City official or employee prior to the time the application is determined to be complete shall not be binding on the City as the official acceptance of the application for filing,
4. A determination of completeness by the Administrative Official shall not constitute a determination of compliance with the substantive requirements of the Land Development Code.
G. Expiration of Application  If a subdivision plat application is not completed on or before the 45th day after the application is received by the Administrative Official for processing, the application will be deemed to have expired. Thereafter, a new subdivision plat application must be submitted, including payment of the applicable application fee. The City shall retain any fee paid for reviewing the original application for completeness.
Land Development Code City of Colleyville, Texas
Chapter 8 - Plat Review Procedures Page 8 - 5
H. Incompleteness as Grounds for Denial  No subdivision plat application shall be scheduled for action by an approving body unless it is determined that the application is complete and all required items, studies and documents have been submitted to and received by the City, unless the applicant has provided a written request for a waiver or modification of said requirement. An incomplete subdivision application shall be grounds for denial or revocation of the application. No vesting right shall accrue from the filing of an application that has expired pursuant to this Section, or from the filing of a complete application that is subsequently denied.
I. Official Plat Submittal Date The date from which the statutory period requiring approval or disapproval of a subdivision plat application shall commence on the date the Administrative Official responsible for processing subdivision plat applications has determined the application to be complete and marked said date on the application and has scheduled said application for action by the approving body.
J. Development Review Committee  The City Manager shall designate a Development Review Committee (DRC) which shall be an advisory committee to the City Council and Planning and Zoning Commission and have responsibility for providing comments and recommendations on subdivision applications. In addition, the Development Review Committee shall submit comments and recommendations on vacation of public rights-of-way or easements and site plan reviews required by this Code.

M. Compliance with Zoning  No subdivision plat shall be approved that is not consistent with the existing zoning regulations applicable to the property being platted, unless a rezoning application is pending that will provide consistency with the proposed development.
N. Public Facilities  No subdivision application shall be approved by the City unless the Director of Public Works has reviewed the construction plans for the proposed public improvements and has determined that the public facilities will be adequate to support and service the area of the proposed subdivision. To expedite the review process, the Director of Public Works may accept a written offer by the developer as satisfactory evidence that public improvement requirements of the Land Development Code will be satisfied. The Director of Public Works may require the applicant to submit sufficient information and data to demonstrate that the existing public facilities are adequate to serve the proposed subdivision. Public facilities and services to be examined for adequacy shall include drainage facilities, roads, sewage, and water systems.

Upon approval of the subdivision application by the City, the offers shall be deemed dedicated and available for acceptance by the City in accordance with the requirements of this Section.
1. Whenever a subdivision proposes the dedication of land for public use and the City finds that such land is not required or is not suitable for public use, the approving body shall either deny the subdivision application or require the rearrangement of lots to include such land.
2. The approval of a subdivision plat by the City is not considered an acceptance of any dedication and does not impose on the City any duty regarding the maintenance or improvement of any dedicated parts until the City Council makes an actual appropriation of the dedicated parts by entry, use, or improvement.
3. Disapproval of a plat shall be deemed a refusal by the City to accept the offered dedications shown thereon.
Q. Nuisance Ordinances and Outstanding Liens  No subdivision plat shall be placed on the agenda for action by an approving body in which the Code Enforcement Officer has issued notice to the owner of the property being subdivided that the property being considered for development is in violation of a public nuisance ordinance of the City of Colleyville and the violation has not been abated prior to the subdivision application date. No subdivision plat shall be placed on the agenda for action by an approving body that has an outstanding delinquent lien payable to the City of Colleyville.
R. Frontage on Public Access Required  Every lot shall have frontage on a public street right-of-way. Said frontage shall not be less than eighty percent (80%) of the minimum required lot width established for the zoning district.

T. Official City Map  The Administrative Official responsible for subdivision review shall maintain an Official City Map, which shall indicate all subdivisions, lots and street rights-of-way. Subdivision plats hereafter approved shall be placed on the Official Map in a timely order and include the names of all streets and street suffix classifications. Where street name inconsistencies exist, from one subdivision to another, the Administrative Official shall place on the Official City Map the generally accepted street name, its proper spelling, and suffix classification. The Administrative Official responsible for subdivision review shall assign street address ranges for each block and coordinate these with the Office of the Fire Marshal and other emergency service providers.

Chapter 8 - Plat Review Procedures Page 8 - 7
Section 8  140 Preliminary Plats
A. Preliminary Plat Classification  Submittal of a Preliminary Plat is the first of a two-step process for approval of a subdivision plat. The Preliminary Plat procedure shall be used when the property proposed for development is not platted as defined in this Chapter, does not qualify as a minor plat, and will be platted in more than one phase. The purpose of the Preliminary Plat procedure is to allow a subdivider to submit an abbreviated subdivision proposal for approval to determine the feasibility of developing a parcel of land before proceeding to the final platting process where the development will involve more than one phase of construction.
B. Platting all Land in Common Ownership  The Preliminary Plat shall include all contiguous holdings of the owner, including land in common ownership as defined in this Chapter, with an indication of the portion which is proposed for subdivision.
C. Preliminary Plat Phasing The Preliminary Plat shall clearly indicate the parcels of land to be included in the phasing. Subsequently, Final Plats shall generally comply with the phasing lines indicated on the Preliminary Plat. Significant departure from the phase lines indicated on the Preliminary Plat shall require an amendment to the Preliminary Plat prior to further final platting of property.
D. Effect of Approval  Upon approval of the Preliminary Plat, a copy of the approved Preliminary Plat shall be signed by the Administrative Official and kept for public record. Said approved Preliminary Plat shall reflect any and all revisions to the original submitted Preliminary Plat as was directed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council which were made a condition of approval. Approval of the Preliminary Plat shall not constitute final acceptance or approval of the subdivision nor shall the approval of the Preliminary Plat confer any vesting rights in the arrangement of lots, streets and other features on the Final Plat. Approval of the Preliminary Plat shall constitute authority to proceed with the Final Plat process as described in this Chapter.
E. Expiration of Approval  Approval of a Preliminary Plat shall expire after twelve (12) months from the date of approval, unless a Final Plat is submitted for all or part of the area that has received Preliminary Plat approval. The approving body may approve a time extension upon written request from the developer or may waive the twelve month termination period when the Final Plat is determined to be consistent with the approved Preliminary Plat and no additional standards have been adopted by the City.
F. Re-submittal of Preliminary Plat  When a Preliminary Plat is disapproved, the subdivider, at any time thereafter, may submit a new design for approval, following the same procedures as required for the original application, including the payment of application fees.
G. Preliminary Plat Exhibits  The subdivider shall file an application for approval of a Preliminary Plat with the Administrative Official responsible for subdivision review, which shall contain the following exhibits to be considered complete:

The Preliminary Drainage Analysis shall be prepared in accordance with the drainage analysis requirements contained in Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards of this Land Development Code.
4. Preliminary Utility Plan  The subdivider shall submit preliminary construction drawings which shall indicate the general location and approximate sizes of all existing and proposed public utilities, unless the Director of Public Works has determined that no public utility improvements are necessary. The
Land Development Code City of Colleyville, Texas
Chapter 8 - Plat Review Procedures Page 8 - 8
size of all proposed water and sewer lines shall be determined using the design criteria contained in Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards of this Land Development Code.
5. Preliminary Topographic/Grading Plan  The subdivider shall submit a plan showing the existing topography of the property proposed for development in contours of not less than two (2) feet, together with any proposed grade elevations, if different from existing elevations.

7. Nuisance Compliance Certification  The Code Enforcement Officer shall provide certification indicating the status of the property regarding public nuisances and outstanding liens payable to the City of Colleyville.
8. Fees  The applicant shall pay the applicable plat application fee when the application is submitted to the Administrative Official.
H. Grading Site Prior to Final Approval  Following Preliminary Plat approval, the developer may apply for an earthwork permit and upon approval of said permit may commence construction to the grades and elevations required by the Preliminary Plat.
Section 8  145 Final Plats
A. Final Plat Classification  Approval of a Final Plat is the second step in the process for approval of a subdivision plat. The Final Plat procedure shall be used when the property proposed for development has been previously approved as a Preliminary Plat, was not submitted as a Combination Preliminary/Final Plat and conforms to the requirements of this Chapter. The purpose of the Final Plat procedure is to allow a subdivider to submit for approval all the documents necessary to fully develop the subdivision.
B. Final Plat Prerequisites  Unless exempt from the requirements of Preliminary Plat approval, no Final Plat shall be placed on the agenda for action by the approving body until a Preliminary Plat of a subdivision has been previously approved in accordance with this Chapter. Upon approval of a Preliminary Plat, a subdivider may file an application for approval of a Final Plat. The Final Plat shall conform to the Preliminary Plat as approved and incorporate any and all changes, modifications, corrections and conditions imposed by the prior approval. A Final Plat will not be presented to the approving body for consideration, which fails to incorporate the recommendations of the Preliminary Plat approval.
C. Final Plat Exhibits  The subdivider shall file an application for approval of a Final Plat with the Administrative Official responsible for subdivision review, which shall contain the following exhibits to be considered complete:
1. Final Plat Application  The application shall be on forms furnished by the Administrative Official responsible for subdivision review. If the applicant is not the official owner of record, written authorization from the property owner is required.

7. Nuisance Compliance Certification  The Code Enforcement Officer shall provide certification indicating the status of the property regarding public nuisances and outstanding liens payable to the City of Colleyville.
8. Fees  The applicant shall pay the applicable plat application fee when the application is submitted to the Administrative Official.
Section 8  150 Combination Preliminary/Final Plat
A. Combination Preliminary/Final Plat Classification  Approval of a Combination Preliminary/Final Plat may occur when a plat is submitted that involves more than four lots and will include a new street but will not be phased but, instead, will be developed in a single phase. The purpose of the Combination Preliminary/Final Plat procedure is to allow a subdivider to submit for approval all the documents necessary to fully develop the subdivision in a single application.
B. Combination Preliminary/Final Plat Exhibits  The subdivider shall file an application for approval of a Combination Preliminary/Final Plat with the Administrative Official responsible for subdivision review, which shall contain the following exhibits to be considered complete:

Section 8  155 Minor Plats
A. Minor Plats: A Minor Plat submittal shall be used when the property proposed for development is not platted, contains four (4) or fewer lots and will not create a new street. A Minor Plat is intended to allow a subdivider to combine the Preliminary and Final Plat procedures and thereby expedite the review and approval of a small subdivision where no new public street is created. Where applicable, the Minor Plat submittal shall contain the same exhibits as a Final Plat submittal.
B. Minor Plat Exhibits  The subdivider shall file an application for approval of a Minor Plat with the Administrative Official responsible for subdivision review, which shall contain the following exhibits to be considered complete:

8. Fees  The applicant shall pay the applicable plat application fee when the application is submitted to the Administrative Official.
Section 8  160 Replats
A. Replats: A Replat submittal shall be used when a previously platted property is proposed for redevelopment. A Replat may include an additional parcel of un-platted property when the size of the un-platted portion
Land Development Code City of Colleyville, Texas
Chapter 8 - Plat Review Procedures Page 8 - 11
does not dictate the submittal of a Preliminary Plat. The Administrative Official responsible for subdivision review shall review each Replat application and determine whether or the not the size of the un-platted portion of the proposed development warrants the submittal of a Preliminary Plat. Where applicable, the Replat submittal shall contain the same exhibits as a Final Plat submittal.
B. Additional Criteria for Replats: The following additional criteria for approval shall apply in the re-subdivision of an existing plat, without vacating the immediate previous plat:
1. A public hearing shall be required on the Replat at which interested parties and citizens have an opportunity to be heard.
2. If any of the proposed area to be re-subdivided or re-platted, within the immediate preceding five years, was limited by any interim or permanent zoning classification to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot, or if any lot in the immediate previous subdivision was limited by deed restriction to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot, notice of the public hearing shall be given in advance in the following manner:
a. Publication at least 15 days before the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
b. A written notice of the public hearing shall be forwarded no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the day of the hearing to the owners (as the ownership appears on the last approved ad valorem tax roll) of all lots in the immediate preceding plat that are within 200 feet of the lots to be re-platted. The notice may be served by depositing it properly addressed and postage paid, in the United States post office.
3. If the proposed replat requires a waiver of a requirement and is protested in accordance with this section, the proposed replat must receive, in order to be approved, the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the members present of the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council. For a legal protest, written instruments signed by the owners of at least 20 percent of the area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed replat and extending 200 feet from that area, but within the original subdivision, must be filed with the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council prior to the closing of the public hearing. In computing the percentage of land area, the area of streets and alleys shall be included.
C. Compliance with paragraphs (a) & (b) is not required for approval of a replat or a portion of a prior plat if the area to be re-platted was designated or reserved for other than single or duplex family residential use by notation on the last legally recorded plat or in the legally recorded restrictions applicable to the plat.

Section 9.7 Lots
A. Lot Arrangement  Lots shall be arranged to provide access to lots from approved streets and to avoid foreseeable difficulties due to topography and natural physical features inherent to the property.

1. Special Lot Width Requirement - The width between side lot lines at their foremost points (where they intersect with the street line) shall not be less than eighty (80) percent of the required lot width.

F. Flag Lots Prohibited  It is the policy of the City to prohibit the creation of flag lots unnecessarily, and to discourage the creation of any lot which, by virtue of its relatively great depth in relation to its width, is likely to facilitate future requests for re-subdivision to create a flag lot.
G. Building Lines  Front building lines shall be shown on all lots in the subdivision. Building lines shall be shown along each street-facing of corner lots and through-lots. The building line shall be consistent with the requirements of the applicable zoning district, however, the City may approve a building line which differs from the zoning requirements when special conditions exist.

If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be drawn so as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the adjacent lots. The City may approve an alternate plan provided the ownership of and responsibility for maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will not become a City responsibility. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provision shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, of design approved by the City. Any lot which includes a water body and contains a building site, shall contain a buildable area that is not less than the minimum buildable area for the applicable zoning district.
Section 9.9 Street Names
The developer shall submit all existing and proposed street names on any proposed subdivision plat. New street names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road names in the city so as to not cause confusion to the general public or for emergency response. A road which is, or planned, as a continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name.
Section 9.10 Reserve Strips and Common Areas

Section 9.12 General Infrastructure Policy
(03-03-09 / O-09-1712)
A. General Requirement  The developer of a subdivision shall install all water, sewer, street, sidewalk and drainage improvements, and any other facilities required by this Land Development Code, which are necessary for the proper development of the subdivision. The design, construction and inspection of any public facilities shall be a cost to the developer, unless the City has entered into an agreement for cost sharing. All such facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria contained in this Land Development Code and be in conformance with the general layout of the City of Colleyville Master Land Use Plan and Capital Improvements Plan. The public facility requirement of this section shall be applicable to the upgrading of any existing facilities which do not meet current standards.
B. Apportionment of Infrastructure Costs  As a condition of the approval of a development, the developers portion of the costs may not exceed the amount required for infrastructure improvements that are roughly proportionate to the projected impact of the proposed development, as determined by a professional engineer, licensed in the State of Texas, and who is retained by the City of Colleyville.
1. In making the rough proportionality determination, consideration shall be given to the availability of adequate and minimum levels of public facilities and accessibility to the site for delivery of emergency services.
2. The professional engineer making the proportionality determination may rely on categorical findings from comparable public improvement projects for establishing a cost basis. The basis used for determining estimated costs shall be revised annually on July 1 by the Colleyville Engineering Department.
3. A developer who disputes the determination by said professional engineer may appeal to the City Council and present testimony and evidence in support of the appeal. The appeal shall be written and filed with the City Secretary within ten (10) days after the date action taken by the Planning and Zoning Commission on the development proposal. The developer shall not be required to waive the right to appeal as a condition of approval of the development project.
C. Optional Escrow Provision Where, in the opinion of the City, construction of a required public improvement should be deferred to a future date, the developer shall place in escrow with the City via Letter of Credit or cash, an amount equal to the estimated cost of the improvements, as determined by the Director of Public Works or designee. The City Council may consider an alternate arrangement when appropriate. Any escrow related to the construction of sidewalks shall adhere to the requirements set forth in Section F.
D. City Participation in Over-Sizing  Where over-sizing of a public improvement is required by the Comprehensive Master Plan, Thoroughfare Plan, Water or Sewer Capital Improvements Plan or other planning document adopted by the City, City participation shall be in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Impact Fee Ordinance or City-Developer Agreement, which has been approved by the City Council.
E. Public Easements  All public improvements shall be constructed within easements or rights-of-way that have been dedicated for public use. The width of an easement or right-of-way shall be in accordance with the specifications contained elsewhere in this Land Development Code.
F. Escrow Policy for Sidewalks
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 5
1. Request for Escrow
Whenever these regulations require a property owner to construct a sidewalk for a dwelling unit, the property owner may petition the City for deposit of an escrowed amount, as established in this Section, in lieu of the required construction of a sidewalk. The Director of Public Works or designee shall determine whether the escrow is reasonable in lieu of the obligation to construct the improvement. If an escrow request is denied, then the applicant may appeal that denial to the City Council if a written request for appeal is received by the Director of Public Works or designee within ten (10) days of the denial.
2. Deposit with the City
Whenever the City agrees to accept escrow deposits in lieu of construction by the owner of the property under these regulations, the property owner or developer shall deposit an amount equal to his share of the costs of design and construction in escrow with the City. This amount shall be paid prior to release of construction plans by the Director of Public Works. The obligations and responsibilities of the property owner shall become those of the property owners transferees, heirs, successors, and assigns; and the liability therefore shall be joint and several.
3. Determination of Escrow Amount
The amount of the escrow shall be determined by using the average of the comparable bids awarded by the City in the preceding six (6) months for sidewalk design and construction or, if none exist, then current market value of the design and construction of a sidewalk in the City, to be determined by the Director of Public Works. The determination shall be based on reasonable current market value made as of the time the escrow is due.
4. Use of Escrow Funds
Funds escrowed pursuant to this chapter shall be expended on design and construction of pedestrian sidewalks and trails located throughout the community and in keeping with the Citys Master Plan.

Drainage Improvement Requirements  The developer shall provide for the design of storm water management in the proposed subdivision and shall be required to furnish, install, construct, or extend, at his own expense, all storm sewers and drainage structure facilities necessary for the proper development of the subdivision. Storm water facilities shall conform to the storm water drainage master plan and shall be designed in accordance with the design standards and specifications contained in this Land Development Code. Alternate earthen channels may be approved when in accordance with the criteria established in Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards.
B. Drainage Easements  All public drainage facilities shall be constructed within a public drainage easement or drainage right-of-way as required by the City. The following statement of restriction shall be placed in the dedication instrument of the subdivision plat:
Drainage Easement Restriction: No construction or filling, without the written approval of the City of Colleyville shall be allowed within a drainage easement, and then only after detailed engineering plans and studies show that no flooding will result, that no obstruction to the natural flow of water will result, and subject to all owners of the property affected by such construction becoming a party to the request. Where construction is permitted, all finished floor elevations shall be a minimum of two feet above the 100-year flood elevation.
C. Development of Flood Plain  Land within the 100-year flood plain shall be subject to the Colleyville Flood Plain Ordinance. Any land which in the natural state is subject to a 100-year flood or which cannot be properly drained shall not be subdivided, re-subdivided, or developed until receipt of evidence that the construction of specific improvements proposed by the developer can be expected to yield a usable building site. Thereafter, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council may recommend approval of the plat. However, construction upon such land shall be prohibited until the specific improvements have been planned and construction completed.
D. Floodway Easements
1. Floodway easements shall be provided along natural drainage-ways and lakes reservations. Floodway easements shall encompass all areas beneath the water surface elevation of the base flood, plus such additional width as may be required to provide ingress and egress to allow maintenance of the banks and for the protection of adjacent property, as determined and required by the Director of Public Works or designee.
2. The following statement of restrictions shall be placed in the dedication instrument of the subdivision plat:
Floodway Easement Restriction: No construction shall be allowed within a floodway easement without the written approval of the City of Colleyville, and then only after detailed engineering plans and studies show that no flooding will result.
E. Off-Site Drainage  The following provisions shall be applicable to off-site drainage of new subdivisions:
1. The developer shall accept and be responsible for all runoff from properties upstream of the proposed development. The proposed improvements shall be designed for fully developed conditions.
2. Where a drainage study indicates that additional runoff from the developing property will overload downstream drainage facilities and result in hazardous conditions, the City may withhold approval of
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 7
the development until appropriate provisions have been made. These provisions shall include any drainage design or construction plans necessary to accommodate the off-site drainage problem.
Section 9.16 Street Improvement Requirements
A. General Requirement  The developer shall construct, at his expense, street facilities necessary for the proper development of the subdivision. The street system shall provide access to every lot in the subdivision and be designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria contained in this Land Development Code.
B. Improvements to Existing Unimproved Streets and Utilities  This section is applicable to a proposed development situated adjacent to an existing street or municipal utility, which does not meet the standards contained in the Land Development Code. (O-06-1562 / 02-07-06)
1. Improvements Required  If a proposed subdivision is situated adjacent to an existing street or municipal utility, which does not meet the standards contained in this Land Development Code, the developer shall bear the cost for constructing the infrastructure improvements required by this Land Development Code in accordance with the General Infrastructure Policy contained elsewhere in the Land Development Code.
For the purpose of this regulation, the calculation used for estimating the reconstruction costs for an unimproved street shall include all street paving, curb and gutter, sidewalks, hike and bike trails, water and sewer utilities, and drainage improvements. The improvements shall be sized in accordance with the most recently approved Master Thoroughfare Plan or Capital Improvements Plan, which is applicable.
2. Escrow  The Administrative Official may recommend approval of a subdivision plat to the Approving Body conditioned upon the deposit in escrow, via Letter of Credit or cash, of the estimated costs of the adjacent unimproved street and utility improvements in-lieu of the actual construction of said facilities. Any escrow, without interest, shall be applied against any assessment for improvements levied on such property, but shall not be deemed to release such property from liability for any future costs assessed which exceed the escrow.
3. One and Two Lot Residential Subdivisions  If a proposed residential subdivision contains only one or two lots and the developer does not own any contiguous property, in lieu of actual construction, the developer shall pay the applicable perimeter street costs in accordance with the General Infrastructure Policy contained elsewhere in this Land Development Code for the initial one hundred feet of street frontage. The applicable perimeter street costs shall be reduced 0.2% per linear foot of frontage in excess of one hundred feet, not to exceed fifty percent of the applicable additional street frontage.
Exemption: A lot platted under this Section that contains an existing single-family dwelling at the time a subdivision plat application is filed with the City and the lot is situated within a zoning district that allows single-family residential uses, said lot shall have an automatic exemption from the perimeter street costs, provided that existing perimeter street facilities are sufficient to assure the safe, effective and orderly movement of traffic in and about the subdivision and utility services are adequate to serve the development. The following notation shall be placed on the plat: Any future divisions of these lots will require full compliance with the unimproved street requirements applicable at the time of any subsequent re-platting.
Section 9.17 Street Design Criteria
A. Street Functional Classification  All streets shall be designed in accordance with the functional classification shown on the most recent version of the Master Thoroughfare Plan and the following:
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 8
Functional Classification of Streets
Street
Classification
Functions - Uses
Local
Carries traffic from residential and commercial areas to collector streets and interconnects individual sites. Local streets carry light traffic volumes and trips are of a short duration.
Collector
Major
Minor
Carries traffic from local streets to arterial streets. Uses served would include medium and high density residential, limited commercial facilities, elementary schools, some small offices and as direct access within industrial parks. Collector streets also carry heavy traffic to major commercial and industrial facilities from arterial streets. Uses would include office parks, industrial parks, and community level commercial facilities.
Arterial
Major
Minor
The main function of an arterial is to carry traffic from on urban area to another. The arterial streets serve the major activity centers of urbanized areas. An arterial street is used for longer urban trips and carries a high portion of the total traffic with a minimum of mileage.
B. Street Design
1. In-General  Streets shall be designed with due regard to topography, with due consideration of the abutting uses, and the anticipated destination of traffic and traffic volumes at full development of the neighborhood. Where necessary to prevent traffic congestion and to ease the movement of vehicles to and from principal traffic generators, additional right-of-way width or other special design shall be provided. Where topographical conditions make other treatment necessary to secure the best overall design, these standards may be modified by the Director of Public Works or designee..
2. Street Continuity  The street layout shall provide for the continuation of the collector street system as shown on the Master Thoroughfare Plan. Streets shall provide connection to streets in adjacent subdivisions, but local streets shall be designed so as to discourage use by through traffic and to require the minimum number of streets necessary for convenient and safe access to property.
3. Curvilinear Streets Encouraged - The developer is encouraged to consider curvilinear, cul-de-sac, and loop street designs where such use would result in a more functional layout and not necessarily adhere to a rigid rectangular street pattern.
4. Right-of-way Widths  Every subdivision plat shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way to comply with the requirements of the Master Thoroughfare Plan. The right-of-way widths shall be designed for the intended use and anticipated traffic volume at optimum development of the area served. Additional right-of-way may be required at street intersections and to provide for left and right turn lanes at high-volume intersections.
5. Cul-de-sac Lengths  No street shall be designed as a permanent dead-end street, but shall be designed to incorporate a cul-de-sac which complies with this Section. (O-00-1261 / 12-19-00)
a. Diameter  A cul-de-sac street shall be provided at the closed end with a minimum property line right-of-way diameter of one hundred feet, and a pavement turn-around with a minimum outside diameter of eighty feet (80). (O-00-1261 / 12-19-00)
b. Length  No cul-de-sac street shall exceed six hundred feet (600) in length, unless additional right-of-way width and additional pavement width are provided as required in this Section. Furthermore, no cul-de-sac street shall exceed the maximum length of one-thousand two hundred feet (1,200). For purpose of this regulation, cul-de-sac length shall be measured along the centerline of the cul-de-sac from the intersecting street right-of-way line to the center point of the cul-de-sac. (O-00-1261 / 12-19-00)
c. Width  A cul-de-sac street shall have a minimum right-of-way width of fifty feet (50) and a minimum pavement width of thirty-one feet (31), back-to-back of curb. However, a cul-de-sac street which exceeds six-hundred feet (600) in length shall have a minimum right-of-way width of fifty-six feet (56) and minimum pavement width of thirty-six feet (36), back-to-back of curb. (O-00-1261 / 12-19-00)
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 9
d. Maximum Number of Lots  The maximum number of single-family lots served on a cul-de-sac street shall be as shown in the following table: (O-00-1261 / 12-19-00)

e. Temporary Turn-Around  A temporary turn-around is required when a street is temporarily dead-ended and is longer than one-hundred and fifty (150) feet, as measured from the intersecting street right-of-way line. The temporary turn-around shall be within a temporary easement and constructed of asphalt or concrete. (O-00-1261 / 12-19-00)
6. Temporary Dead-End Streets - Temporary dead-end streets shall have provision for future extension of the street and utilities and, if a temporary cul-de-sac is utilized, a reversionary right to the land abutting the turnaround for excess right-of-way shall be provided.
7. Stub-outs for Future Extensions - Permanent dead-end roads shall not be allowed. The street layout shall be extended to the tract boundary to provide for future access into adjoining tracts to assure adequate neighborhood circulation unless: 1) prevented by topography or other physical conditions; or 2) the City Council determines that the extension is not necessary for future development of adjacent tracts. In general, these extensions should be not more than one thousand (1,000) feet apart.
8. Pavement Required - All street surfaces within or abutting the proposed subdivision shall be paved, with curbs and gutters installed, and constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications contained elsewhere in this Land Development Code.
9. Frontage Access Road - Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed collector street or railroad right-of-way or abuts a commercial or industrial land use, the City may require a frontage street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way to separate through and local traffic, or reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or equivalent treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties.
10. Half Streets - Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and where the City Council finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining land is subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
11. Number of Subdivision Entryways  Every subdivision shall be designed to provide sufficient access into the development to accommodate anticipated traffic demands and to provide for emergency public services using the criteria contained in this Section. (O-01-1280 / 08-08-01)
a. Where a proposed subdivision, or cul-de-sac street, contains more than twelve (12) lots, the development shall provide for two entryways as follows:
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 1 0
i. The development shall provide one street entryway and one emergency access easement. The emergency access easement shall be located on an adjacent or opposite side of the subdivision from the main entryway. The widths of the right-of-way and driving surfaces of the street entryway and the emergency access easement shall be in accordance with the standards contained elsewhere in this Land Development Code, or
ii. The development shall provide two street entryways separated not less than one-hundred feet between the centerlines of the driving surfaces. The widths of the right-of-way and driving surfaces of the two entryways shall be in accordance with the standards contained elsewhere in this Land Development Code, or
iii. The development shall provide a divided entryway and one emergency access easement. The driving surfaces of the divided entryway shall be separated by a median not less than ten (10) feet in width and provide for one-way traffic. The widths of the right-of-way and driving surfaces of the divided entryway shall be in accordance with the standards contained elsewhere in this Land Development Code. The emergency access easement shall be located on an adjacent or opposite side of the subdivision from the main entryway and be constructed in accordance with the standards contained elsewhere in this Land Development Code.
b. If it is physically impractical or otherwise impossible to provide two entryways or to incorporate an emergency access easement into the development in accordance with the above stated requirements, the following alternative may be considered by the approving body:
i. A single pavement width of forty-one (41) feet shall be constructed. Said pavement shall extend back from the intersecting street right-of-way a minimum distance of one-hundred (100) feet. All residences within the subdivision shall contain automatic fire-sprinkler systems.
c. If it is physically impractical or otherwise impossible to comply with the above-stated requirements, an alternative design may be submitted to the City Council for consideration. The approving body may approve the alternate design if it finds that the above-stated requirements can not be satisfied and that all efforts have been made by the developer to comply with said requirements.
12. Reverse Curves - Between reverse curves there shall be a tangent section of centerline not less than one hundred feet (100) long.
C. Intersections
1. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be acceptable.
2. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the City.
3. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred thirty-five (135) feet shall not be permitted.
4. Local streets intersecting a collector street or larger shall have a tangent section of centerline at least fifty (50) feet in length measured from the right-of-way line of the collector street; however, no such tangent is required when the minor street curve has a centerline radius greater than four hundred (400) feet with the center located on the collector street right-of-way line.
5. At local street intersections, the property line corner shall be rounded by an arc having a radius of twelve (12) feet. This radius shall be increased when the smallest angle of intersection is less than eighty (80) degrees. At intersections of streets with major and collector streets the property line corners shall be rounded by an arc having a radius of twenty-five (25) feet. The Director of Public Works or designee may approve comparable cut-offs or cords in place of rounded corners.
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 1 1
6. Where practical, spacing of intersections along collector streets shall be at least 500 feet apart.
D. Alleys  Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts and at the rear of multifamily residential building sites for adequate circulation. Where approved by the Fire Marshal, an emergency access easement not less than twenty-four feet (24) in width shall be provided for emergency vehicle access in lieu of any alley. Alleys should intersect streets at right angles or radially to curved streets where sharp changes in alignment cannot be avoided. Property line corners shall be cut off fifteen feet (15) on each side to permit safe vehicular movement. Dead-end alleys shall be prohibited except where prior development of land adjoining the subdivision permits no other reasonable design; under such circumstances alleys shall be provided with turnaround or back-around facilities at the dead-end adequate to permit clear maneuvering of sanitation trucks, utility service vehicles and emergency vehicles. Alleys shall be not less than the following widths:
1. Twenty feet (20) where residential building sites are provided on both sides;
2. Twenty-two feet (22) wherever residential development abuts commercial or industrial areas;
3. Twenty-four feet (24) where commercial or industrial development abuts on both sides.
Section 9.18 Easements
A. Easements  Easements for drainage and utility construction, service, and maintenance shall be provided in locations approved by the City and affected utilities according to the following standards:
1. Easement for the use of public utilities of not less than seven and one-half (7.5') feet in width shall be provided on each lot and extend along the entire length of the rear property line. Easements shall connect with easements already established on adjoining properties or extend to connect with a public right-of-way. No lot shall be shown with an easement which prevents proper development and full utilization of the lot as a suitable building site for the intended zoning district.
2. For lots of more than two hundred (200) feet deep, the utility easement shall be not less than sixteen (16) feet wide.
3. The width of any drainage easement shall be determined by the Director of Public Works or designee or in accordance with the need for drainage improvements established by any drainage study.
4. All utility easements shall be dedicated as utility and/or drainage easements.
5. When an easement is granted for public purposes as a separate instrument, the following statement of restrictions shall be placed in dedication instrument:
Utility Easements
Any public utility, including the City of Colleyville, shall have the right to move and keep moved all or part of any building, fences, shrubs, other growths or improvements which in any way endanger or interfere with the construction, maintenance, or efficiency of its respective systems on any of the easements shown on the plat; and any public utility, including the City of Colleyville, shall have the right at all times of ingress and egress to and from and upon said easements for the purpose of construction, reconstruction, inspection, patrolling, maintaining and adding to or removing all or part of its respective systems without the necessity at any time of procuring the permission of anyone.
B. Easements Adjacent to State Highways  When a proposed water or sewer line or drainage facility will be placed adjacent to a public road maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation, a separate specific use easement shall be provided for each utility or drainage facility.
C. Emergency Access Easements  Emergency access easements shall have a clear unobstructed width to accommodate a pavement section of not less than twenty-four (24) feet in width.

Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 1 2
the dead-end, and appropriate turning space at inside corners to permit free movement of emergency vehicles. An emergency access easement may be used as a driveway to gain access to parking or loading spaces, but shall not be used for parking. All emergency access gates shall provide for an opening of not less than twenty four (24) feet wide by fourteen (14) feet in height and include a locking and opening mechanism acceptable to the Fire Department. (03-20-07 / O-07-1613)
D. Mutual Access Easements (O-02-1336 / 04-16-02)
1. Purpose  The purpose of this requirement is to provide public access to adjacent properties by reducing the number of driveway cuts and potential traffic accidents on adjacent streets.
2. Applicability  This Section shall be applicable to properties abutting and that may derive access from a Collector Street or Arterial Street as shown on the Master Thoroughfare Plan.
3. Requirement  The City shall require the dedication of a mutual access easement to provide cross access to adjacent properties or shared use of a driveway to conform with the minimum driveway standards contained in Chapter 14 of this Land Development Code.
4. Easement Dimensions  Easements for shared driveways shall be 16 feet in width and 35 feet in length, but may vary given the shape of the particular tract. Easements extending across the entire width of the property shall not be less than 24 feet in width.
Section 9.19 Private Utilities
A. Newly Installed Utilities Required to be Underground (O-17-2015 / 08-15-17)
1. All newly installed gas, electric, telephone utilities, street lighting, cable television, and fiber lines shall be underground except where conditions do not warrant underground installations and as approved by the City Council.
2. All electric, telephone, cable, and fiber utilities shall be placed in the rear easement. Mechanical equipment, transformers, and other visible installations will not be permitted in the front yards of any lots.
3. All support equipment (transformers, amplifiers, switching devices, etc.) necessary for underground installations shall be pad mounted or placed underground. Nothing in this section shall restrict or prohibit the placement, erection, or construction of street lighting poles or standards above ground, provided all lines and wires used to provide such lighting are placed underground.

Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 1 3
Section 9.20 Traffic Impact Analysis
When a proposed subdivision plat is estimated to generate more than 1,000 vehicle trips per day, a traffic impact analysis shall be required with the earliest submittal of a plat application. The traffic impact analysis shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Director of Public Works or designee. The purpose of the traffic impact analysis is to determine the need for traffic mitigation measures which may include, but are not limited to, dedication of additional right-of-way, construction of turning lanes, or construction of traffic control facilities. This requirement may be waived when a traffic impact analysis was submitted at the time the current zoning was adopted and the traffic impact analysis is less than one year old. Any mitigating measures required shall be the responsibility of the developer, unless a cost-sharing agreement is approved by the City.
Section 9.21 Sidewalks
A. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide for the adequate construction of, or funding for, pedestrian walkways within the City in order to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the community.
B. Sidewalk Requirements: Sidewalk installation shall be determined using the standards outlined herein.
1. New Development: requiring a new roadway
Residential: both sides of roadway; Exception = single-loaded roadway (houses/ development on one side of the street only)
Commercial: both sides of roadway
2. New Development: adjacent to existing roadway
Residential: (1) required if fronting a roadway designated on the Master Thoroughfare Plan as a non-local street; or (2) on a street designated for sidewalk placement on the 2019 Sidewalks and Trails Map. Exception = large lot with more than 300 of frontage
Commercial: along frontage of all roadways
3. Existing Development/Single Family Home Construction
Residential: (1) required if fronting a roadway designated on the Master Thoroughfare Plan as a non-local street; (2) on a street designated for sidewalk placement on the 2019 Sidewalks and Trails Map; or, (3) on a street where sidewalks exist on 50% or more of the properties on the block face. Exception = large lot with more than 300 of frontage
Commercial: along frontage of all roadways
4. Master Thoroughfare Plan
Sidewalks required on both sides of roadway on non-local streets; Exception = Roadway project listed on CIP 5-year list and planned for full reconstruction, must be installed by City. Developments along these roadways shall contribute cash-in-lieu funds to the City equivalent to the cost of installation at the time of development.
5. Repairs/Replacement/Maintenance
The City shall be responsible for the maintenance and replacement of sidewalk segments congruent with this policy. This is to ensure a safe and well connected network. In the event a sidewalk segment is damaged by misuse or neglect, the adjacent property owner shall be responsible for the cost of appropriate maintenance or replacement.
6. Design Standards
All sidewalks shall be a minimum of four (4') feet in width, except a sidewalk located within or abutting a collector street, or larger, as shown on the Master Thoroughfare Plan, which shall not be less than five (5) feet in width. All sidewalks and pathways shall be constructed in the area between the curb or grade line of the public street and the abutting property line unless the
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 1 4
pathway is situated within a dedicated pathway easement or right-of-way. The edge of the sidewalk or pathway shall generally be parallel with the curb line and be situated no more than one (1) foot from the abutting property line. The Director of Public Works may approve a plan to alter the location and size of a sidewalk to preserve a tree or for aesthetic purposes. One additional foot of width shall be added to a sidewalk that abuts a street curb.
7. Waivers/Variances
A complete waiver of the requirement for the construction of sidewalks for a specific development should be rare and allowed only where there are unusual factors. The City Manager or designee shall make a determination as to whether or not the waiver should be granted, and document that determination with supporting data that states the basis for the decision. The waiver must be reviewed by both the Director of Community Development and the Director of Public Works and a recommendation provided to the City Manager or designee. Regardless of the reason for the waiver grant, payment shall by collected by the City for the cash-in-lieu value of the sidewalk improvements waived. The City shall use said funds for the maintenance and installation of pedestrian sidewalks and trails throughout the community and in keeping with the Master Plan.
Unusual factors include:
(1) Projects where the cost of establishing sidewalks or walkways would be unreasonably disproportionate to the cost of the associated roadway construction or overall project costs (however a partial waiver may be granted in lieu of a full waiver to reduce the cost of required sidewalks such that the costs will not be unreasonably disproportionate),
(2) Areas with severe topography or other natural constraints that will constrain proper implementation of this plan,
(3) Situations inherently adverse to pedestrian activity, such as harmful noise, dust creation, and high volume truck traffic, in certain areas, such as agricultural, heavy commercial, and industrial developments, or
(4) Situations where an applicant can show other factors or circumstances amounting to reasonably justifiable good cause to support such waiver.
A denial of a request for a waiver of these requirements may be appealed to the City Council.
(1) A written appeal must be filed with the Director of Public Works within ten (10) days of the denial.
(2) The appeal must provide justification for the requested waiver based on the criteria described in (1), (2), (3), and (4) above.
(3) The Council must make findings based on these criteria in order to approve a waiver. If substantial new information, not provided as part of the original request, is provided by the applicant within 14 days of the City Council meeting, or during the City Council meeting, the item shall be referred back to the Director of Community Development and Director of Public Works for reconsideration prior to a decision by the City Council.
8. Remediation (local streets only)
The City recognizes the existence of disjointed/disconnected sidewalk segments throughout the city that serve little purpose in furthering the welfare or walkability of the community. Where such sidewalks exists, the City should pursue funding options to complete the segment, block or area sidewalk installation. Requests to remove existing sidewalks within the segments identified in the 2019 Sidewalks and Trails Map should only be permitted as the exception rather than the rule. Unless specifically identified on the 2019 Sidewalks and Trails Map as sidewalks NOT required, sidewalk removal shall require cash-in-lieu equivalency payment to the City for the value of the removed sections. In cases where removal is deemed appropriate, the property owner shall be responsible for all removal and restoration.
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 9  Subdivision Design & Public Facilities P a g e 9 - 1 5
9. Funding
The City Council should develop a multi-year plan for the installation of sidewalks in compliance with the 2019 Sidewalks and Trails Map. Such plans should include a funding source and annual allocation to specific projects.
C. Trails System Sidewalks  When a proposed sidewalk coincides with the general location of a future sidewalk shown in the most recently approved Colleyville Trails System Plan, the sidewalk shall be constructed in accordance with the design standards for a trails system sidewalk. The standards and specifications for a trails system sidewalk are contained elsewhere in this Land Development Code. The developer shall be required to provide additional street right-of-way dedication or a public access easement of sufficient width to accommodate the trails system sidewalk. Where the trails system sidewalk will be located at the rear or to the side of a lot, such as within a green-belt or similar open space, the developer shall provide sufficient right-of-way or public access easement to accommodate the sidewalk.
D. 2019 Sidewalks and Trails Map- This map shall be kept by record on file with the City Secretary and/or a City Designee.

Section 9.22 Street Lighting
A. General Requirements  The developer shall be required to install, at no cost to the City, a street lighting system at all street intersections, at the end of all cul-de-sac streets, and at additional locations in accordance with the criteria contained elsewhere in Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards of this Land Development Code. All City Lighting shall be consistent with standard light pole ONCOR Texas Style Pole D with Luminaire F with a Finial Band.

or two gate sections to meet the required minimum width of 24 feet. If the entrance is to incorporate a median, guard shack, or similar structure that necessitates a divided gate arrangement, the gate and street pavement widths may be reduced if approved by the City, but in no case shall any single gate or street pavement have a clear opening of less than 18 feet in width nor fourteen (14) feet in height. (O-00-1261 / 12/19/00)
All restricted access entrances shall be equipped with the Opticom gate opening system. The system shall be maintained by the HOA in good working condition at all times.
M. Visitor Entrance Design Standards - At least one entrance per subdivision with private streets must be equipped for visitor access. In addition to the above Restricted Access Entrance Design Standards, said visitor entrance must be equipped with a call or code box located at least 50 feet from the boundary of the subdivision to provide for visitors calling in and automobile queuing. The City reserves the right to require the developer to provide a detailed study to determine if the traffic generated by the proposed development will warrant the call or code box to be set back greater than the 50 foot minimum requirement in order to ensure sufficient vehicle storage or queuing space. A turn-around space with a minimum outside radius of 30 feet must be located between any call or code box and access control gate or cross arm to allow vehicles denied access to safely exit onto public streets in a head out position.

O. Hold Harmless - The subdivision final plat and the HOAs documents must contain language whereby the HOA, as owner of the private streets and appurtenances, agrees to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its officers, agents, licensees, servants and employees, from and against any and all claims or suits for property damage or loss and/or personal injury, including death, to any and all persons, of whatsoever kind of character, whether real or asserted, arising out of or in connection with, directly or indirectly: a) the reasonable use of the private streets, emergency access, utility easements, entrance gate or structure by the City, its officers, agents, licensees, servants and employees; b) the condition of the private streets, private street lights, private entrance gates or structures, private walls or fences, private pedestrian access, private storm drainage systems and emergency access; or c) any use of the subdivision with private streets by the City, its officers, agents, licensees, servants and employees for any purpose related to the exercise of a governmental function or service, whether or not caused, in whole or in part, by alleged negligence of officers, agents, servants, employees, contractors, subcontractors, licensees or invitees of City. The HOA shall be responsible for carrying liability insurance to meet the requirements in this paragraph. Those portions of the HOAs documents pertaining to the subject matter contained in this paragraph must not be amended without the written consent of the City.
P. Revocation of Private Street Permit - The City Council, after giving a sixty (60) day notice to the HOA, its successors or assignees and after holding a public hearing, may revoke a private street permit issued to a subdivision with private streets if the Council finds that the private street permit was obtained by fraud or deception, or if the HOA fails to provide reliable emergency access. The revocation of a private street permit shall give the City the right to inspect the private streets and levy an assessment upon each lot on a pro-rata basis for the expense of needed repairs. Said assessment shall constitute an assessment lien upon the lot against which each assessment is made. The City Council shall be the final judge of whether repairs are needed. The City shall also have the right to require, at the HOA's expense, the removal of guard houses, access control devices, landscaping or other aesthetic amenities located within the street lot. If the permit is revoked, the HOA will be assessed the cost for appropriate maintenance. The HOAs documents must provide for the City's right to require said assessment and removal of improvements.

existing residential dwelling. Any additional lots created by further subdivision of the property shall be subject to the requirements herein.

11.5.B LAND DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS
1. Standards
In reviewing proposed dedications of park land, the following criteria shall be imposed; provided, however, the approving body may vary or waive any of the following criteria on a finding that the proposed dedication of park land is in accordance with the development of the City, complies with the statement of intent of the Park Land Dedication Ordinance and because of the uniqueness of the property, requires a variance:
a. Park land shall be clearly visible from the public rights-of-way and shall be located so as to give maximum possible exposure throughout the neighborhood.
b. Access to the park land shall be available from public rights-of-way.
c. Where the proposed park land is a flood plain area which is proposed as a linear park, the following shall also be considered:
i. Whether the proposed site contains significant environmental features representative of a pre-urbanized Colleyville, including trees, plants, wildlife, topography, geological outcroppings, unique water features or any combination thereof.
ii. Whether the proposed site currently provides, or will provide in the future, an effective linkage to other existing or anticipated public park sites which will allow movement to and from places where residents live, work and play.
iii. Whether the proposed site is easily accessible, visible and identifiable.
iv. Whether the proposed site has street frontage along its entire length.
v. Whether the proposed site is designed to be used and function as a natural waterway with minimal site alteration.
d. A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of any dedicated park land shall have grades of less than three percent (3%) and shall be well drained and suitable for development of park land improvements.
e. Park land shall be provided with access to all utilities, including water and sewer, along the street frontage of the park.
f. Park land shall not be burdened with easements, rights-of-way, deed restrictions or other limitations which prohibit or inhibit the use of the park land for park purposes.
2. Amount and Location
a. Residential Developments
Based on the population projected to reside in the City of Colleyville, as stated in the 1998 Master Plan adopted by the City Council, the City desires to provide 12.93 acres of park land for every new 1,000 residents in an ultimate condition. Park Land meeting the requirements contained within this section shall be dedicated to the City at a ratio of one (1) acre of park land for every twenty-five (25) residential dwelling units or a prorated portion thereof.
Land Development Code City of Colleyville, Texas
Chapter 11  Park Land Dedication Page 11 - 3
The subdivider shall dedicate to the City a minimum of 0.040 acres of park land in fee simple for each DU (dwelling unit) within the subdivision; provided, however, no tract of park land shall be less than seven (7) acres in total area unless approved by the City Council.
b. Non-Residential Developments
Although non-residential development does not generate residential occupancies per se, it does create environmental impacts, which may negatively affect the living environment of the community. These impacts may be ameliorated or eliminated by providing park or open space areas which buffer adjoining land uses, prevent undue concentration of paved areas, allow for the reasonable dissipation of automotive exhaust fumes, provide natural buffers to the spread of fire or explosion, and provide separation of lighting, waste disposal, and noise by-products of non-residential operations and activities from adjacent residential areas. The City has therefore determined that non-residential developments must provide dedicated parks and/or reserved open space at a ratio of one (1) acre of park land for every fifty-six (56) non-residential gross acres of development or prorated portion thereof.
c. Off-site Dedications
A developer may dedicate the required park land for a development at another location owned by the same developer within the City with the consent of the City, provided that the off-site dedication is in accordance with this ordinance.
3. Documents Accompanying Final Plat
Where the subdivider proposes to dedicate land to the City for park land purposes, the following additional documents shall be submitted to the City with the submission of the final plat of the subdivision:
a. An environmental study, audit or assessment demonstrating that the property is in a condition which would allow the City to utilize the property for park purposes without expenditures to remove environmental waste or hazardous materials, that the property is suitable and safe for use as a park and is free from environmentally related problems.
b. If a developer chooses to dedicate the land or to build the park, a site plan of the park property containing a conceptual plan of the type, nature, and extent of improvements which could be made to the property and identifying the property as to type, i.e., neighborhood park, linear park, special purpose or community park.
c. A statement as to the number of proposed DUs within the subdivision.
4. Condition of Property and Acceptance by the City of Colleyville
Prior to the issuance of a building permit for the erection of any house within the subdivision, the subdivider shall apply to the City for written acceptance of the park land, which shall be accepted upon completion of the following conditions:
a. The subdivider shall permanently mark each corner of the park site with a three-quarter inch (3/4") iron pin set in concrete.
b. The subdivider shall provide the City with a survey acceptable to the City reflecting each corner monument, showing and locating any encroachments, easements and providing a metes and bounds description of the park land.
c. All rubbish, trash, junk and other offensive materials shall be removed from the park land and the property returned to its natural condition except as to approved construction and improvements thereon.
Land Development Code City of Colleyville, Texas
Chapter 11  Park Land Dedication Page 11 - 4
d. All improvements or construction on or within the park land to be installed by the subdivider shall be completed in accordance with approved construction plans.
e. All other applicable ordinances of the City have been complied with.
11.5.C ALTERNATIVES TO LAND DEDICATION
1. Authorization
In any case where a dedication is required, the City shall have the right to accept the dedication, as submitted for approval, or in the alternative, to refuse dedication of the same, and in lieu thereof to require payment of cash under the formula contained in this Section. The City may permit a combination of dedication and fees to be used to fulfill this requirement.
2. Fee Payment Alternative
Approval of Fee Payment Alternative: The City Council shall upon recommendation of the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, determine the acceptability of a developers payment of fees in lieu of land dedication requirement of this section.
3. Calculation of Fees

a. Residential Dwelling Unit Fees: Fees paid in lieu of dedication shall be based on the determined cost of 1 acre of land divided by twenty-five (25), for a resulting fee per residential dwelling unit of $1,802.
b. Non-Residential Development Fees: The fee payment alternative for non-residential development shall be calculated by dividing the determined cost of one (1) acre of land by fifty-six, for a resulting fee per non-residential acre cost of $800 per acre.
c. Park land fees shall not be assessed or collected for lots that do not impact the parks system. Examples of lots that do not impact the parks system include, but are not limited to, open space lots, greenbelts, and detention or retention lots. (O-07-1606 / 01-16-07)
4. Collection of Fees

Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 13  Impact Fees Page 2 of 22
B. No new development shall be exempt from the assessment of impact fees as defined in this Chapter.
Section 13  130 Impact Fees as Conditions of Development Approval
No final plat for new development shall be approved within the service area without assessment of impact fees pursuant to this Chapter, and no water and wastewater tap shall be issued and no building permit shall be issued unless the applicant has paid the impact fees imposed by and calculated as provided herein.
Section 13  135 Establishment of Service Areas
A. The water, wastewater and roadway service areas are established as shown on the Service Area Map, attached as Exhibit -13-B  Service Area Map. The service areas shall be established consistent with any facility service area established in the CIP for each utility.
B. The boundaries of the water, wastewater and roadway service areas may be amended from time to time, and new service areas may be delineated, pursuant to the procedures in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code.
Section 13  140 Service Units
A. Service units are established in accordance with generally accepted engineering and planning standards.
B. For water and wastewater impact fees, service units shall be calculated in accordance with the attached Exhibit -13-C  Table of Water and Wastewater Service Unit Equivalencies, as determined by the size of the water meter(s) for the development, or alternatively, as approved the City Engineer as a result of an engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering services in the State of Texas, which demonstrates that the number of service unit equivalents (SUEs) for the new development will be different than those indicated by the size of the water meter.
C. If the Director of Public Services determines that the water pressure in the City's transmission main is significantly higher or lower than standard pressure such that the size of the water meter is not indicative of actual service demand, the Director may adjust the number of (SUEs) based on a smaller or larger sized meter which more accurately reflects the flow rate and the system pressure conditions.
D. If a fire demand meter (tap) is purchased for a property, the meter size utilized to calculate the number of (SUEs) shall be the dimension of the portion of the fire demand meter which reflects the meter size which would provide only domestic service to the property. Said reduced meter size shall then be utilized to calculate the number of (SUEs).
1. The meter types used to calculate the number of (SUEs) shall be either simple or compound meters.
2. If the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the City's meter-reading and billing systems, the then-owner of the property shall be assessed the then current fee for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity.
3. To avoid the use of fire flow volumes for domestic usage, the owner of any property for which a fire demand meter is purchased shall be required to execute a restrictive covenant on a form approved by the City Attorney, which covenant shall acknowledge the right of the City to assess such fees to subsequent owners of the property. Said covenant shall be executed prior to the purchase of the fire demand meter and shall be filed in the deed records of the County.
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 13  Impact Fees Page 3 of 22
4. No fees shall be collected for the purchase of taps which shall be utilized to provide only fire protection capacity.
E. Upon wastewater tap purchase for lots for which no water meter has been purchased, service units shall be established by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Texas, shall be reviewed by the Engineer and shall be presented to Council, which shall designate the appropriate number of service units.
F. For roadways, service units shall be calculated in accordance with Exhibit - 13.D  Table of Vehicle-Mile Equivalencies.
G. The City Council may revise the service unit equivalency tables according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors.
Section 13  145 Maximum Assessable Impact Fees Per Service Unit
A. Calculation Method  The maximum assessable impact fee per service unit for each service area shall be computed by dividing the growth-related capital construction cost of service in the service area identified in the capital improvements plan for that category of capital improvements, by the total number of projected service units anticipated within the service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development, based on the land use assumptions for that service area.
B. Utility or Ad Valorem Tax Credits  The maximum assessable impact fee is determined by applying a credit back to the development community based on the utility revenues or ad valorem taxes that are allocated for paying a portion for future capital improvements. The maximum assessable water impact is 72.9 percent of the Pre-Credit Recoverable Costs. The maximum assessable wastewater impact fee is 76.1 percent of the Pre-Credit Recoverable Costs. The maximum roadway impact fee is 93.5 percent for Service Area One and 95.1 percent for Service Area Two of the Pre-Credit Recoverable Costs.
C. Maximum Assessable Water and Wastewater Impact Fees  The maximum assessable impact fees per service unit for water and wastewater facilities after applying the utility or ad valorem tax credits is contained in Exhibit -13-E  Table of Maximum Assessable Water and Wastewater Impact Fees.
D. Maximum Assessable Roadway Impact Fees  The maximum assessable impact fees per service unit for roadway facilities after applying the utility or ad valorem tax credits is contained in Exhibit -13-F  Table of Maximum Assessable Roadway Impact Fees.
Section 13  150 Assessment of Impact Fees
A. The assessment of an impact fee for any new development shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
B. Assessment of the impact fee for any new development shall be made on occurrence of the following events:
1. For new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the City's subdivision regulations after June 20, 1987, or for which replatting results in an increase in the number of service units after such date, assessment shall be at the time of final subdivision plat approval, and shall be the amount of the impact fee per service unit, as provided in the Schedule of Impact Fees to be Collected that is in effect at the time of subdivision plat approval.
2. For new development which has received final plat approval prior to June 20, 1987, and for which no replatting is necessary prior to the issuance of a building permit, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit, and shall be the amount of the impact fee per service unit set forth in the Schedule of Impact Fees to be Collected that is in effect at the time of building permit application.
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 13  Impact Fees Page 4 of 22
3. For new development which occurs or is proposed to occur without platting, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit or water or sewer tap purchase (whichever occurs first), and shall be the amount of the impact fee per service unit set forth in the Schedule of Impact Fees to be Collected that is in effect at the time of building permit application.
4. For water and wastewater facilities, fees shall not be assessed to a development for which taps previously were purchased and which development does not result in an increase in the number of living unit equivalents as determined by the service unit equivalency table. If the exchange of said taps will result in an increase in the number of (SUEs), impact fees for the increase in the number of (SUEs) shall be assessed in accordance with the Schedule of Impact Fees to be Collected that is in effect at the time of subdivision plat approval.
5. Because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole, water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to assessment or collection of a water or wastewater impact fee. However, if the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the City's meter-reading and billing systems, the current owner of the property shall be assessed the impact fees currently in effect at the time such conversion is established by the City for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity.
C. Following assessment of the impact fee above, no additional impact fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases.
D. Following the lapse or expiration of approval for a plat, a new assessment must be performed at the time a new application for such development is filed.
Section 13  155 Schedule of Actual Impact Fees Collected
A. Water Impact Fee Schedule  The actual water impact fee collection rate which is to be paid by each new development shall be 40.8% of the maximum allowed. This rate is incorporated into Exhibit 13-G  Schedule of Actual Water and Wastewater Impact Fees to be Collected, which shall become effective on August 22, 2012.
B. Residential Irrigation Meter Exemption  The payment of the water impact fee shall not be required by an existing residential customer for the installation of a meter to serve a separate lawn irrigation system provided all of the following requirements are met:
1. The lawn irrigation meter does not exceed the  x ? standard basic meter size,
2. The lawn irrigation shall be located on the same property as the residential meter,
3. the residential property must be owner-occupied and be in possession of a valid certificate of occupancy, and
4. The lawn irrigation meter only serves the lawn irrigation system.

Chapter 13  Impact Fees Page 6 of 22
C. Limitations for Offsets and Credits  All offsets and credits against impact fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this Chapter and additional standards promulgated by the City, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines.
1. No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities, except where credit is provided in this Chapter, or for any capital improvement which is not identified within the applicable capital improvements plan, unless the City agrees that such improvement supplies capacity to new developments other than the development paying the impact fee and provisions for offsets are incorporated into an agreement for capital improvements.
2. Any construction of, contributions to, or dedications of off-site roadway facilities agreed to or required by the City as a condition of development approval shall be credited against roadway impact fees otherwise due from the development.
3. The unit costs used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the capital improvements plan for the category of facility within the service area for which the impact fee is imposed.
4. An offset or credit created pursuant to prior impact fee ordinances shall expire no later than ten (10) years after the effective date of this amendatory ordinance, unless a different expiration date has been agreed to by the City by contract or certificate.

6. Offsets or credits created after the effective date of this amendatory ordinance for a development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date hereof shall be discounted to take into account the number of service units in the development which will utilize the facility for which the offset or credit was given.
D. Application for Offset or Credit  An applicant for new development must apply for an offset or credit against impact fees due for the development either at or before the time of plat recordation, unless the City agrees to a different time.

Chapter 13  Impact Fees Page 8 of 22
2. The value of the impact fee due;
3. The availability or the value of an offset or credit;
4. The application of an offset or credit against an impact fee due,
5. The amount of the refund due, if any; or
6. The alternative determination by the City Engineer concerning the size of the water meter which is to be converted to service units.
B. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the value of the fee or the value of the offset or credit was not calculated according to the applicable impact fee schedule or the ordinance provisions and guidelines established for determining offsets and credits.
C. The appellant may appeal the decision of the City Manager to the City Council. A notice of appeal to the Council must be filed by the applicant with the City Secretary within thirty (30) days following the City Manager's decision. If the notice of appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the City Attorney in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact fee due, the development application or tap purchase or building permit issuance may be processed while the appeal is pending.
Section 13  173 Refunds
A. Time Limit Prior to Refund  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to this Chapter which has not been expended within ten (10) years from the date of payment, shall be refunded, upon application, to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid, or, if the impact fee was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in Article 1.03, Title 79, Revised Statutes (Article 5069-1.03, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), or any successor statute.
B. Pro-Rated Refund  If a refund is due, the City shall pro-rate the same by dividing the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner or governmental entity shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount.
C. Determination of Excess Fees Upon Completion of Improvements  Upon completion of all the capital improvements or facilities expansions identified in the capital improvements plan upon which the fee was based, the City shall recalculate the maximum impact fee per service unit using the actual costs for the improvements or expansions. If the maximum impact fee per service unit based on actual cost is less than the impact fee per service unit paid, the City shall refund the difference, if such difference exceeds the impact fee paid by more than ten percent (10%). The refund to the record owner or governmental entity shall be calculated by multiplying such difference by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount.
D. Request of Refund Fees - Upon the request of an owner of the property on which an impact fee has been paid, the City shall refund such fees if:
1. Existing service is available and service is denied; or
2. Service was not available when the fee was collected and the City has failed to commence construction of facilities to provide service within two years of fee payment; or
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 13  Impact Fees Page 9 of 22
3. Service was not available when the fee was collected and has not subsequently been made available within a reasonable period of time considering the type of capital improvement or facility expansion to be constructed, but in any event later than five years from the date of fee payment.
E. Proportional Refund Due to Downsizing Meter  The City shall refund an appropriate proportion of impact fee payments in the event that a previously purchased unused water meter is replaced with a smaller meter, based on the SUE differential of the two meter sizes and the per-SUE fee at the time of the original fee payment, less an administrative charge of $50.
F. Procedure for Petitioning of Refund  Petition for refunds shall be submitted to the Director of Public Services on a form provided by the City for such purpose. Within one month of the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the Director must provide the petitioner, in writing, with a decision on the refund request, including the reasons for the decision. If a refund is due to the petitioner, the Director shall notify the Finance Director and request that a refund payment be made to the petitioner. The petitioner may appeal the determination to the City Manager and Council, as set forth in this Land Development Code.

Section 14-170 Drainage and Storm Sewer Improvements
A. General  This section pertains to general design requirements for drainage and storm sewer construction in the City of Colleyville. All drainage facilities shall be sized and designed in accordance with the City of Colleyville Drainage Master Plan or as determined by the Director of Public Works.
B. Runoff Calculations  The selection of which method to use for calculating runoff depends upon the size of the contributing drainage area at the most downstream point of the project. The "Rational Method" is acceptable for designing projects in which the drainage area is less than one-hundred (100) acres. A unit hydrograph method is required for projects with larger drainage areas.
1. No matter which method is used to calculate runoff, a developer or builder of residential property greater than one (1) acre in size, or any property that was platted as a part of an overall tract which was greater than one (1) acre in size (including churches and schools), shall develop the property so that the rate of runoff created by the development as it leaves the property does not exceed the rate of runoff that is currently occurring in the existing conditions. A developer or builder of commercial property greater than one-half (1/2) acre must follow the above guidelines.
2. Runoff computations shall be based upon fully developed watershed conditions in accordance with the land use projections in the latest comprehensive land use plan for the City of Colleyville. The design engineer shall size drainage facilities by disregarding the detention effects of upstream property and calculating the runoff as if the off-site property was developed without any detention. If an approved regional detention/retention facility is in operation, the design engineer may size downstream drainage facilities based on consideration of the detention effects of the regional facility.
C. Drainage Areas Less Than one-hundred acres
1. Computation of Storm water Runoff for drainage areas less than one-hundred (100) acres shall be by the "Rational Method," which is based on the principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge.
(see next page)

I = Intensity of Runoff in inches per hour (reference chart from the Ft. Worth Drainage Manual)
A = Drainage Area in acres
2. Time of concentration is the longest time, without interruption of flow by detention devices that a drop of water takes to flow from the farthest point of the drainage area to the point of concentration (i.e. the point of design). The time of concentration is composed of the inlet time and the flow time in a conduit or channel to the point of design.
The inlet time shall be 10 minutes for property zoned multiple family, churches, schools, local business, central business, commercial, or industrial.
An inlet time of 15 minutes shall be used for property zoned for parks, cemeteries, agricultural, and single family residential.
When designing inlets and laterals, the time of concentration is equal to the inlet time. The design engineer will compare the above specified inlet times to the actual calculated inlet time by computing the flow time overland and along the gutter to the first inlet. Manning's Equation shall be used to determine flow time to the inlet. The design engineer may use the actual calculated or specified inlet time. In no case shall a longer inlet time be used than 10 minutes for multiple family, commercial, churches, schools, industrial and business areas and 15 minutes for parks, cemeteries, agricultural, and single-family areas.
D. Drainage Areas of one-hundred (100) acres or More
1. For drainage areas of one-hundred (100) acres or more where the use of the "Rational Method" does not provide reliable results, the use of a unit hydrograph method shall be made. The use of a unit hydrograph calculation will be based upon standard and accepted engineering principles subject to the approval of the Director of Public Works. Acceptable methods include the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Technical Release Number 55 or the Corps of Engineers HEC-1 models for drainage areas one-hundred (100) acres or more.
2. The unit hydrograph method shall be based upon fully developed watershed conditions assuming no effects from the small on-site detention facilities for maintaining the rate of runoff as if the property was undeveloped. The detention effects of large regional detention facilities can be taken into account in unit hydrograph methods.
3. Circumstances that may require the use of a unit hydrograph method include sizing open channels, reclaiming floodplains, creating lakes, or building other types of drainage-related facilities on major drainage courses. Design engineers of these types of facilities should be aware that the requirement of designing for fully developed watershed conditions will mean that they will have to calculate these fully developed flows instead of using the flows calculated in the Federal Emergency Management

Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards Page 14 - 31
Agency's (FEMA) flood insurance studies for Colleyville or Tarrant County or from studies performed for or approved by the City of Colleyville.
E. Design Storm Frequencies  All developments submitted must provide data for the following design storm frequencies: 2-Year / 5-Year / 10-Year / 25-Year / 50-Year / 100-Year.
1. Drainage facilities shall be designed in accordance with the following table:
Drainage Facility Design Frequency
Drainage Facility
Design Recurrence Interval
Closed Storm Sewer Systems
5-year with 100-year positive overflow in streets such that the depth of flow in the street does not exceed the right-of-way or drainage easement capacity.
Closed Storm Sewer Systems and Inlets at Street Low Point or Sag
100-year with positive overflow
Culverts and Bridges
100-year
Concrete-lined Channels
100-year
Earthen Channels
100-year
2. The approved drainage system shall provide for positive overflow at all low points and these areas must be denoted on the plans as such. The term "positive overflow" means that when the inlets do not function properly or when the design capacity of the conduit is exceeded, the excess flow can be conveyed overland along a grassed or paved course. Normally, this would mean along a street or alley, or shall require the dedications of special drainage easements on private property.
F. Street and Alley Capacity
1. Streets  Streets and storm drains within new developments shall be designed so that storm water runoff resulting from a design storm of a one-hundred (100) year frequency is contained within the available right-of-way and/or drainage easement. The capacity of the street and right-of-way and/or easement and the storm sewer pipe working in combination must be designed for a capacity to safely contain a storm water from a design storm of one-hundred (100) year frequency.
2. Alleys  The flows created by the one-hundred (100) year storm shall be contained within the capacity of all paved alleys.
G. Inlet Placement and Capacity  The storm sewer system is to begin at the point where the storm water from a five (5) year frequency storm reaches curb depth, with the exception of collector streets on which storm sewer facilities must be designed to prevent one-twelve (12') foot wide lane from ponding and on major streets on which storm sewer facilities must be designed to prevent one-twelve (12') foot wide lane in each direction from ponding. At such point where the combined capacity of the street and storm drain system satisfies the five (5) year street capacity criteria (as previously described) but the one-hundred (100) year frequency storm runoff can not be contained within the right-of-way additional pick-up points (inlet capacity) shall be provided along with an increase in storm sewer capacity so that the one-hundred (100) year frequency storm runoff will be contained within the right-of-way.
1. Inlets shall be placed upstream from an intersection whenever possible. At any intersection, only one street shall be crossed with surface drainage and this street shall be the lower classified street. When an alley intersects a street, inlets shall be placed in the alley whenever flow down that alley would cause the capacity of the intersecting street to be exceeded.
2. The minimum inlet size shall be ten (10') feet. No more than twenty (20') feet of inlet shall be placed along one gutter at any given location. Minimum sizes of laterals shall be twenty-one (21") inches for use with ten (10') foot inlets, and twenty-four (24") inch laterals with fourteen (14') foot, twenty (20) foot inlets, and drop inlets. Where laterals tie into trunk lines, place the laterals on a minimum angle forty-five (45) degrees and a maximum angle of sixty (60) degrees with the trunk line and connect them so that the longitudinal centers intersect.

Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards Page 14 - 34
J. Bridges  Two (2') feet of freeboard is required between the one-hundred (100) year water surface elevation and the low chord of the bridge. Exceptions to this requirement must be approved by the Director of Public Works in writing.
1. The skew of the bridge piers and abutments shall be oriented as close to the normal or flood direction of flow resulting in an angle of attack as close to zero (0) degrees as possible.
2. Bridge piers shall be aligned to provide the minimum resistance to the flow of water during the 10, 50, 100 and 500 year events.
3. Computer modeling programs used for the hydraulic analysis of bridges shall be HEC-RAS, Version 2.2, or HEC2.
4. Stream stability shall be assessed when designing the abutments and interior bents of the bridge. Scour shall be accounted for in the design.
5. Where flows are supercritical, erosion control measures shall be used in an area from one-hundred (100') feet upstream from a bridge to twenty-five (25') feet downstream from a bridge.
K. Channels  Open channels may be used instead of an enclosed system when a pipe greater than an eighty-four (84") inch diameter (or other shape equivalent to more than thirty-eight and a half (38.5) square feet) is required to carry the design storm event.
1. Design Criteria:
a. All open channel design must follow the Corp of Engineers Guidelines.
b. Channels may be left in their natural state provided that the channel velocities are six (6.0') feet per second or less and that one (1') foot of freeboard is available during the design storm event.
c. If the natural channel is to be replaced by an improved channel, the flow from the one-hundred (100') year design flood must be contained within the improved channel while allowing for one (1') foot of freeboard.
d. Improved channels shall be trapezoidal shaped and include a lined section if the design velocity is greater than six feet per second. Lining types such as concrete, rock walls and gabions may be used upon approval of the Director of Public Works. The maximum velocity allowed in concrete lined channels is fifteen (15') feet per second.
e. Unless shown to be feasible in a soils report sealed by a licensed professional engineer in the State of Texas, and approved by the Director of Public Works, improved channels shall have minimum side slopes of:
(1) 4 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical for earthen, grassed-lined side slopes.
(2) 2 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical for concrete-lined side slopes.
f. Where practicable, all unpaved channels should have sufficient grade to avoid ponding. A minimum slope of 1.00% is required for earthen channels and swales, except those used as part of a wetlands area. In areas where 1.00% cannot be obtained a pilot channel approved by the City may be used. All lined channels are to have a minimum slope of 0.50% and earthen channels a minimum slope of 1.00%.
g. The developer or owner shall use low maintenance vegetation for vegetative cover, as approved by the Director of Public Works prior to planting. The selection of materials shall comply with the current ground cover listing for North Central Texas furnished through the Texas Agricultural Extension Service.
2. Manning's Equation can be used to design channels and determine water surface elevations and velocities when backwater effects are negligible, subject to approval by the Director of Public Works.
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards Page 14 - 35
Channels where backwater effects occur must be designed using models accepted by FEMA.
3. All channel sections must consider and account for channel stabilization in their design. This requirement pertains to all sections whether they are left in their natural condition or are modified in any manner. The design of all drainage channels and swales shall assure adequate capacity and minimum maintenance to overcome the result of erosion, silting, sloughing of bends or similar occurrences.
4. When performing hydraulic analyses for channel or drainageway design, the one-hundred year (100) year starting water surface shall be based on the following:
a. Known water surface elevations should be used where possible. Known elevations are available for some creeks and channels from previous studies approved by the City.
b. When known water surface elevations are not available the slope-area method or a rating curve may be used.
(1) A rating curve approximates the starting water surface elevation for a given flow by using the relationship between known flows and water surface elevations for the creek. This is an excellent method for determining starting conditions if good data is available to develop the rating curve.
(2) The slope-area method approximates the starting water surface elevation by calculating the normal depth for the channel. To calculate normal depth the slope of energy gradient for the channel is required. The energy slope can be approximated using the average slope of the channel or the average slope of the water surface.
5. The design of the channel lining shall take into account the super-elevation of the water surface around curves and other changes in direction. In general a radius that is three (3) times the top width of the water surface during the design storm event is recommended for channel bends.
6. A chain link fence six (6') feet in height, or other improvements as approved on a case by case basis by the Director of Public Works, shall be constructed on each side of the lined channel.
7. Gabion or other forms of channel lining may be used in lieu of reinforced concrete lining with the approval of the Director of Public Works.
L. Detention / Retention Facilities  Detention or retention facilities may be used to reduce peak discharges where conditions prevent conveying storm water to an adequate discharge point. Detention or retention facilities shall be privately maintained unless the City of Colleyville has agreed to accept public dedication of the facility. (O-05-1558 / 12/13/05)
1. Runoff rates for all land uses shall be limited to the rates that would be produced from single family residential areas. This requirement also applies to the development of sites as churches, school, and other institutional uses. Detention/retention facilities shall be designed for the fully developed one-hundred (100) year design flood according to the criteria contained in this Section.
2. The minimum amount of storage volume of the detention basin shall be that volume required to reduce runoff rate during the one-hundred (100) year event to the undeveloped rate. The outflow structure shall be sized to reduce the 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 year discharges to the undeveloped rate. Dedicated detention/retention basins shall also include an additional one (1) foot of freeboard and two (2) feet of sediment storage. The volume of runoff storage for drainage areas greater than one-hundred (100) acres shall be computed using unit hydrograph procedures. Acceptable unit hydrograph procedures are provided in Section 14-170.D.1 of this document.
For drainage areas less than one-hundred (100) acres, the above methods are recommended; however, an approximate routing method based on the modified rational method is allowable.
3. All detention facilities designed shall consider the timing of the flood peak in the main channel into which the detention facility drains. Delaying the peak from a site in lower portions of a watershed
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards Page 14 - 36
may result in a higher peak on the main channel. The Director of Public Works may require that upstream and downstream ponds be included in the detention design model.
4. A detention facility shall have enough gradient to ensure positive drainage to the outlet structures so as to avoid nuisance conditions such as standing water, odors, insects, and weeds. A minimum slope of 0.50% towards the outlet structure is required for all grass lined detention facilities.
5. Detention areas in parking lots shall not be:
a. In required parking spaces.
b. Behind speed bumps unless the speed bumps are made with reinforced concrete.
c. Deeper than six (6") inches unless otherwise approved by the Director of Public Works.
6. Drainage easements shall be provided for all regional detention/retention facilities and for other detention/retention facilities where two or more owners are involved.
7. Individual detention facilities shall be designed to empty in less than three (3) hours, unless it is also serving as an erosion control facility.
8. Detention facilities used as a sediment control facility shall meet the following requirements:
a. The sediment control facility shall be designed with minimal velocities such that sediment is dropped and not picked up by flows at any time during the storm event.
b. The basin shall be designed with two (2) feet of sediment storage area so that sediment removal is not required more than twice a year. Expected removal periods greater than twice a year must be specified in the maintenance plan and approved by the Director of Public Works.
c. Sediment control facilities cannot be used to meet detention requirements unless the volume of sediment is included in the calculations for the detention basin design.
9. The owner shall maintain detention/retention facilities unless the facilities are dedicated to the City of Colleyville. Detention facilities must be properly maintained if they are to function as intended over a long period of time. The following measures are required to ensure the facility functions properly.
a. Facilities should be mowed at least twice a year to control weeds and discourage woody growth.
b. Debris, litter and accumulated sediment should be removed from detention facilities at least twice a year. Particular attention should be given to removal of debris, litter and sediment around outlet structures. The Director of Public Works may require that the property owner remove said debris when in the Directors determination that property damage or a flood hazard may exist.
c. Detention basins designed for sediment removal shall be maintained as specified in the maintenance plan and approved by the City with construction plan submittal.
10. Retention facilities shall provide for continuous water movement, aeration facilities or other process approved by the City that is designed to prevent surface accumulation of aquatic vegetation. Failure to prevent surface accumulation of aquatic vegetation will result in additional water movement, aeration facilities or other processes approved by the City being required. (O-05-1558 / 12/13/05)
M. Flumes  The use of flumes is not recommended for widespread use. Flumes shall not be permitted when the purpose of a permanent flume is to carry runoff down the sides of earthen channels.
1. A flume may be used to direct overflow runoff along property lines until the runoff can be intercepted by streets or conduits. A flume shall not carry more than ten (10) cubic feet per second during the one-hundred (100) year storm event with a slope of 1.00%.
2. All flumes crossing sidewalks shall be covered or bridged such as to minimize danger to pedestrians.
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards Page 14 - 37
3. All edges are to be protected with rock rip-rap or other form of protection for erosion control and scour purposes.
N. Lakes  Approval to develop in any area subject to inundation by a lake must be obtained from the appropriate agency responsible for that particular lake before the city grants its approval. Agencies that should be contacted include U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tarrant County Water Control Board, TCEQ, the Trinity River Authority, and FEMA.
Regardless of approvals obtained from those agencies listed above, no filling, development or construction in any area subject to inundation by a lake shall occur without the approval of the City Manager. The City Manager may require any studies necessary to determine that filling, development or construction will not have a detrimental effect on adjacent, upstream or downstream properties and buildings. This subsection in no way diminishes other requirements of this section.
O. Lot Drainage and Grading  Grading and drainage of all residential lots shall be designed in a manner which will allow one lot to drain across an adjacent lot and into a permanent structure, such as a concrete flume, lined channel, or proper inlet to an adequate drainage facility, or to a street right-of-way. If an approved drainage structure is not present, it will be required of the developer to construct the necessary facilities. (O-00-1261 / 12/19/00)
1. Sheet flow techniques shall be used for lot to lot drainage where possible. (O-00-1261 / 12/19/00)
2. Single lots shall accommodate their own drainage into an approved structure where topographic elevations allow this to occur. (O-00-1261 / 12/19/00)
Section 14-175 Miscellaneous

On construction projects in which trench excavation will exceed a depth of five (5) feet, the uniform set of general conditions must require that the bid documents and the contract include detailed plans and specifications for adequate safety systems that meet Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and that these plans and specifications include a pay item for these same safety systems.
B. Underground Utilities  All distribution lines, cables, etc. for utilities other than those listed above shall be installed below ground within the subdivision. Transmission lines or major cables to provide utilities such as electric, telephone, and cable television to the area as a whole may be located above ground on the perimeter of the subdivision being served. The installation of these utilities shall conform to commonly accepted construction standards and be subject to review by the Director of Public Works.
Section 14-180 Drainage Studies and Engineering Certification
A. Preliminary Drainage Analysis Guidelines  The purpose of a Preliminary Drainage Analysis is to determine the need for drainage facilities and/or drainage easements either within the proposed development or offsite. A Preliminary Drainage Analysis is required for every subdivision plat or a development requesting a building permit on a parcel which does not have a previously approved drainage analysis, unless the Director of Public Works has waived this requirement due to existing conditions. The Preliminary Drainage Analysis shall consist of the following information:

5. If any portion of the proposed subdivision or its offsite improvements (including pipes or ditches) falls within the limits of a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) floodplain, additional backwater calculations may be required. Additional calculations in the form of a Conditional Letter of Map Revision will be required if:
a. Any portion of the proposed subdivision is determined to be located within a FEMA Zone "A" floodplain; or
b. Any portion of the proposed subdivision is determined to be located within a FEMA Zone "AE" floodplain and the overall subdivision (including all phases) is 5 acres or larger; or
c. Any portion of the proposed improvements from a subdivision include dredging or filling within a FEMA designated floodway.
Colleyville, Texas, Land Development Code
Chapter 14  Engineering Design Standards Page 14 - 39
6. Backwater calculations shall comply with normally accepted standards as required by FEMA for application for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). In addition, the calculations must begin with a previously defined Base Flood Elevation (BFE). The calculations shall continue upstream through the project until the proposed BFE is within .01 feet of the existing BFE or the limits of the existing Zone 'A' have been reached. A LOMR will be required prior to issuing building permits.
