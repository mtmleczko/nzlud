PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Liberty, South Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Claire E. Woelfel, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-5. - Severability of parts of Code.

(Code 1979, § 1-C-305) 
Sec. 1-6. - Amendments to Code. 
(a)  All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code of Ordinances, which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code of Ordinances, may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion in this Code; or in the case of repealed articles, sections and subsections or any part thereof by subsequent ordinances, the repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby and the subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of the subsequent ordinances until the time that this Code of Ordinances and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code of Ordinances. 
(b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That Section ____________ of The Code of Ordinances of the City of Liberty, South Carolina, is hereby amended to read as follows:...." The new provisions shall then be set out in full as enacted.

(e)  All sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed must be specifically repealed by section, article or chapter number, as the case may be. 
(Code 1979, § 1-C-306) 
Sec. 1-7. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with the Code in any manner whatsoever, which will cause the law of the City of Liberty to be misrepresented thereby. Any person, firm or corporation violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-10. 
(Code 1979, § 1-C-307) 
Sec. 1-8. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code may be prepared whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, when necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from the reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings, and titles for section and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings, and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivision to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" to words of the same meaning as "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ / ____________ / ____________ to ____________ / ____________ / ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of the ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-9. - Acts prohibited or punishable. 
    In the construction of this Code and of all ordinances of the city, all acts prohibited or punishable under this Code or under any particular ordinance shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be construed to refer to the acts when committed or occurring within the limits of the city or in other places over which the city municipal court and city police have authority or jurisdiction under the laws of the state, even though the Code or the particular ordinance only provides that the acts shall be prohibited or punishable and shall not specifically designate the jurisdiction or scope thereof. 
(Code 1979, § 1-C-309) 
Sec. 1-10. - General penalty; continuing violations.

ARTICLE V. - SMOKING REGULATIONS 

Sec. 23-101. - Findings. 
    As an incident to the adoption of this article, the city council ("city council") of the City of Liberty, South Carolina (the "city") makes the following findings: 
(1)  Secondhand smoke as defined herein includes both smoke exhaled and smoke from the end of a burning cigarette, cigar or pipe; and includes a complex mixture of nearly 5,000 chemical compounds, including 43 chemicals that are known human carcinogens; and 
(2)  The health consequences of involuntary smoking have been reported by the U.S. Surgeon General to be a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers; and 
(3)  The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that a simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same airspace does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers; and 
(4)  Secondhand smoke has been classified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a known cause of cancer in humans (Group A Carcinogen) like asbestos, arsenic, hexavalent chromium; and 
(5)  The National Institutes of Health, Centers for disease Control and Prevention, National Toxicology Program, Report on Carcinogens and the International Agency for Research and Cancer have all reported that secondhand smoke is a human carcinogen; and 
(6)  Numerous medical and scientific studies show substantial levels of exposure to secondhand smoke among the United States population, and over the past two decades, the health hazards resulting from exposure to secondhand smoke have been increasingly recognized; and 
(7)  Secondhand smoke inhaled by a pregnant woman can increase the risk for low weight babies; and 
(8)  Exposure to secondhand smoke by children leads to decreased lung function, asthma, pneumonia, ear infections, bronchitis and even sudden infant death syndrome; and 
(9)  Exposure to secondhand smoke nearly doubles the risk of heart attack; and 
(10)  460,000 annual deaths in the United States directly attributed to tobacco use, of which 55,000 are involuntary tobacco users; and 
(11)  Workplaces have been shown to be locations of significant exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke by employees working in the Town of Sullivan's Island; and 
(12)  Both the Public Health Services National Toxicology Program and the World Health Organizations' International Agency for Research on Cancer identify secondhand smoke as a human Class A carcinogen and state that there is no safe level of exposure; and 
(13)  There are laws, ordinances and regulations in place that protect workers from other environmental hazards, including Class A carcinogens, asbestos, arsenic and benzene, but none which regulate exposure to secondhand smoke; and 
(14)  Prohibiting smoking in the workplace increases public awareness of the negative health effects of smoking, reduces the social acceptability of smoking and reduces harm to children and other nonsmokers; and 
(15)  The South Carolina General Assembly at Section 44-95-10 et seq. (the "Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990") imposed certain limitations on smoking. For example, it limited smoking in government buildings (the definition of which includes city-owned buildings) except where the owner of such building shall designate smoking areas. 
    City council has now determined that additional regulation of smoking in areas beyond those addressed in the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990 is appropriate in furtherance of its duty to protect the health of its citizens and employees in the workplace and therefore enacts this article. 
(Ord. No. 06-0901, § 1(A), 10-9-2006) 
Sec. 23-102. - Intent. 
    City council finds that it is in the best interest of the people of this city to protect nonsmokers from involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace.

Therefore, the city council of Liberty does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-32. - Findings of fact. 
    The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-33. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
    It is the purpose of this article to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the article prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    The objectives of this article are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of the article are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this article is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
    Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-34. - Lands to which this article applies. 
    This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study, dated December 21, 2017, with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. 
    Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study for the unincorporated areas of Pickens County, with accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this article.

(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-37. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions, shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-38. - Partial invalidity and severability. 
    If any part of this article is declared invalid, the remainder of the article shall not be affected and shall remain in force. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-39. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-40. - Penalties for violation. 
    Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before June 25, 1976 (initial FIRM date, or January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date). 
    Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before December 2, 2002. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs). 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

    Flood-resistant material means any building material capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours) with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively after submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs. 
Some structures or districts listed on the state or local inventories may not be "historic" as cited above, but have been included on the inventories because it was believed that the structures or districts have the potential for meeting the "historic" structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced that the state department of archives and history has individually determined that the structure or district meets DOI historic structure criteria. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) means applies to all new and renewed flood insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged. 
    Limited storage means an area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant or breakaway material, void of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be temperature controlled. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in an A, AE and A1-A30 zone it must meet the requirements of section 29-81(4) of this article. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in a V, VE and V1-V30 zone it must meet the requirements of section 29-86 of this article. 
    Lowest adjacent grade (LAG) means an elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any deck support, exterior walls of a building or proposed building walls. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this article. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for the purpose of this article, the Nations Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which the base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) are shown. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 means as corrected in 1929, elevation reference points set by National Geodetic Survey based on mean sea level. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means vertical control, as corrected in 1988, used as the reference datum on flood insurance rate maps. 
    New construction means structure for which the start of construction commenced on or after December 2, 2002. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structure. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs) is completed on or after December 2, 2002. 
    Primary frontal dune means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively steep slope to a relatively mild slope. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and, 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Repetitive loss means a building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event. 
    Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The act provides that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances. 
    Stable natural vegetation means the first place on the oceanfront where plants such as sea oats hold sand in place. 
    Start of construction, for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of "substantial improvement." 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or, 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from a term or terms of this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these regulations.

(b)  In addition to the notifications required watercourse alterations per section 29-64(3)a., written reports of maintenance records must be maintained to show that maintenance has been provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is maintained. This maintenance must consist of a comprehensive program of periodic inspections, and routine channel clearing and dredging, or other related functions. The assurance shall consist of a description of maintenance activities, frequency of performance, and the local official responsible for maintenance performance. Records shall be kept on file for FEMA inspection. 
(c)  If the proposed project will modify the configuration of the watercourse, floodway, or base flood elevation for which a detailed flood insurance study has been developed, the applicant shall apply for and must receive approval for a conditional letter of map revision with the Federal Emergency Management Agency prior to the start of construction. 
(d)  Within 60 days of completion of an alteration of a watercourse, referenced in the certification requirements of section 29-63, the applicant shall submit as-built certification, by a registered professional engineer, to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(4)  Floodway encroachments. Prevent encroachments within floodways unless the certification and flood hazard reduction provisions of section 29-82(5) are met. 
(5)  Adjoining floodplains. Cooperate with neighboring communities with respect to the management of adjoining floodplains and/or flood-related erosion areas in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards. 
(6)  Notifying adjacent communities. Notify adjacent communities prior to permitting substantial commercial developments and large subdivisions to be undertaken in areas of special flood hazard and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
(7)  Certification requirements. 
(a)  Obtain and review actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor of all new or substantially improved structures, in accordance with administrative procedures outlined in section 29-63(2)b. or the coastal high hazard area requirements outlined in section 29-86(5). 
(b)  Obtain the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with the floodproofing certification outlined in section 29-63(2)a. 
(c)  When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect in accordance with the non-residential construction requirements outlined in section 29-82(2). 
(d)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in the coastal high hazard area requirements outlined in section 29-86(4), (6) and (8) of this article. 
(8)  Map interpretation. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article. 
(9)  Prevailing authority. Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations for flood protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, etc.) shall prevail. The correct information should be submitted to FEMA as per the map maintenance activity requirements outlined in section 29-82(7)b. 
(10)  Use of best available data. When base flood elevation data and floodway data has not been provided in accordance with section 29-34, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize best available base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, including data developed pursuant to the standards for subdivision proposals outlined in section 29-82(12), in order to administer the provisions of this article. Data from preliminary, draft, and final flood insurance studies constitutes best available data from a federal, state, or other source. Data must be developed using hydraulic models meeting the minimum requirement of NFIP approved model. If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used. 
(11)  Special flood hazard area/topographic boundaries conflict. When the exact location of boundaries of the areas special flood hazards conflict with the current, natural topography information at the site; the site information takes precedence when the lowest adjacent grade is at or above the BFE, the property owner may apply and be approved for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) by FEMA. The local floodplain administrator in the permit file will maintain a copy of the letter of map amendment issued from FEMA. 
(12)  On-site inspections. Make on-site inspections of projects in accordance with the administrative procedures outlined in section 29-65(1). 
(13)  Administrative notices. Serve notices of violations, issue stop-work orders, revoke permits and take corrective actions in accordance with the administrative procedures in section 29-65. 
(14)  Records maintenance. Maintain all records pertaining to the administration of this article and make these records available for public inspection. 
(15)  Annexations and detachments. Notify the state department of natural resources land, water and conservation division, state coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program within six months, of any annexations or detachments that include special flood hazard areas. 
(16)  Federally funded development. The President issued Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, May 1977. E.O. 11988 directs federal agencies to assert a leadership role in reducing flood losses and losses to environmental values served by floodplains. Proposed developments must go through an eight-step review process. Evidence of compliance with the executive order must be submitted as part of the permit review process. 
(17)  Substantial damage determination. Perform an assessment of damage from any origin to the structure using FEMA's Residential Substantial Damage Estimator (RSDE) software to determine if the damage equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(18)  Substantial improvement determinations. Perform an assessment of permit applications for improvements or repairs to be made to a building or structure that equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction. Cost of work counted for determining if and when substantial improvement to a structure occurs shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur. 
The market values shall be determined by one of the following methods: 
(a)  The current assessed building value as determined by the county's assessor's office or the value of an appraisal performed by a licensed appraiser at the expense of the owner within the past six months. 
(b)  One or more certified appraisals from a registered professional licensed appraiser in accordance with the laws of the state. The appraisal shall indicate actual replacement value of the building or structure in its pre-improvement condition, less the cost of site improvements and depreciation for functionality and obsolescence. 
(c)  Real estate purchase contract within six months prior to the date of the application for a permit. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-65. - Administrative procedures. 
(1)  Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit progresses, the local floodplain administrator shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the floodplain administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(2)  Stop-work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this article, the floodplain administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor. 
(3)  Revocation of permits. The local floodplain administrator may revoke and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. 
(4)  Periodic inspections. The local floodplain administrator and each member of his/her inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(5)  Violations to be corrected. When the local floodplain administrator finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his/her duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property he owns. 
(6)  Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the floodplain administrator shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, that: 
(a)  The building or property is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance; 
(b)  A hearing will be held before the local floodplain administrator at a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and 
(c)  Following the hearing, the local floodplain administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears appropriate. 
(7)  Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the floodplain administrator shall find that the building or development is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance, he/she shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such period, not less than 60 days, the floodplain administrator may prescribe; provided that where the floodplain administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. 
(8)  Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice of appeal in writing to the floodplain administrator and the clerk within ten days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the floodplain administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
(9)  Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the discretion of the court. 
(10)  Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared in violation of this article and after all other penalties are exhausted to achieve compliance with this article then the local floodplain administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate a Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with the article. Once a violation has been remedied the local floodplain administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the Section 1316 be rescinded.

Secs. 29-66-29-80. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 29-81. - General standards. 
    Development may not occur in the special flood hazard area (SFHA) where alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures cannot be located out of the SFHA and that encroachments onto the SFHA are minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Reasonably safe from flooding. Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
(2)  Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure. 
(3)  Flood resistant materials and equipment. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(4)  Minimize flood damage. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages. 
(5)  Critical development. shall be elevated to the 500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year flood elevation data. 
(6)  Utilities. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood plus one feet (freeboard). 
(7)  Water supply systems. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(8)  Sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(9)  Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent floatation and lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads. 
(10)  Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this article, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this article. This includes post-FIRM development and structures. 
(11)  Non-conforming buildings or uses. Non-conforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this article. Provided, however, nothing in this article shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this article. 
(12)  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in section 29-82, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-82. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard (zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE) where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 29-34 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local floodplain administrator section 29-64, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in section 29-82(4). 
(2)  Non-residential construction. 
(a)  New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in section 29-82(4). No basements are permitted. Structures located in A zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. 
(b)  A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in section 29-63(2)a. A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 29-115 of this article. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of section 29-115 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this article. Structures that are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The local floodplain administrator must approve the maintenance plan and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to it. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. 
(a)  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or sub-division, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(b)  Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions for residential construction in section 29-82(1) of this article must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower one foot than above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(c)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement in accordance with Section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height an engineering certification is required. 
(d)  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local floodplain administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator. 
(4)  Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(a)  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
2.  The bottom of each opening must be no more than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening. 
3.  Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area. 
4.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
5.  Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building. 
(b)  Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized. 
(c)  Enclosures below lowest floor. 
1.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
2.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required for safety, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
3.  One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in section 29-82(1), (2) and (3). 
4.  All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in section 29-82(1), (2), (3) and (4) should be of flood resistant materials. 
(5)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 29-34, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
(a)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
1.  It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local floodplain administrator. 
2.  A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision must be obtained upon completion of the proposed development. 
(b)  If section 29-82(5)a. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
(c)  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of section 29-82(3) and the encroachment standards of section 29-82(5)a. are met. 
(d)  Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the floodway configuration. 
(6)  Recreational vehicles. 
(a)  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is: 
1.  On wheels or jacking system; 
2.  Attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices; and 
3.  Has no permanently attached additions. 
(b)  Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be: 
1.  On site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the development permit and certification requirements of section 29-64, general standards outlined in section 29-81, and manufactured homes standards in section 29-82(3) and (4). 
(7)  Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures that flood maps, studies and other data identified in section 29-34 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data. The following map maintenance activities are identified: 
(a)  Requirement to submit new technical data. 
1.  For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical or scientific data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA as soon as practicable, but no later than six months of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood elevations or alter floodway boundaries; 
b.  Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area; 
c.  Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and 
d.  Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with section 29-83(1). 
2.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data, required in accordance with section 29-82(7), prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA.

Sec. 29-83. - Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard (zones A and V) established in section 29-34, are small streams where no base flood data has been provided and where no floodways have been identified. The following provisions apply within such areas: 
(1)  In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data are not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates base flood elevations for all subdivision proposals and other proposed developments containing at least 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less. 
(2)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and new development shall be permitted within 100 feet of the stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  If section 29-83(1) is satisfied and base flood elevation data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions of division 3 and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established in accordance with section 29-65(11). 
(4)  Data from preliminary, draft, and final flood insurance studies constitutes best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical Bulletin 1-98, Use of Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Data as Available Data. If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used. 
(5)  When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal, state, or other source one of the following methods may be used to determine a BFE. For further information regarding the methods for determining BFEs listed below, refer to FEMA's manual Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas: 
(a)  Contour interpolation. 
1.  Superimpose approximate zone A boundaries onto a topographic map and estimate a BFE. 
2.  Add one-half of the contour interval of the topographic map that is used to the BFE. 
(b)  Data extrapolation. A BFE can be determined if a site within 500 feet upstream of a reach of a stream reach for which a 100-year profile has been computed by detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope characteristics are relatively similar to the downstream reaches. No hydraulic structures shall be present. 
(c)  Hydrologic and hydraulic calculations. Perform hydrologic and hydraulic calculations to determine BFEs using FEMA approved methods and software.

(3)  All structures on slopes must have drainage paths around them to guide water away from the structures. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-86. - Coastal high hazard areas (V zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 29-34 or section 29-65(11) are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave wash. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide, first line of stable natural vegetation and comply with all applicable Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) setback requirements. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) of the lowest floor is located no lower than N/A feet above the base flood elevation. 
(3)  All buildings or structures shall be securely anchored on pilings or columns, extending vertically below a grade of sufficient depth and the zone of potential scour, and securely anchored to the subsoil strata. 
(4)  All pilings and columns and the attached structures shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, lateral movement and scour due to the effect of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. 
(5)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in section 29-86(3), (4), (6) and (9) of this article. 
(6)  There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, thereby rendering the building free of obstruction prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. Only beach compatible sand may be used. The local floodplain administrator shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist that demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
(a)  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
(b)  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
(c)  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
(7)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes that would increase potential flood damage. 
(8)  All new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Breakaway wall enclosures shall not exceed 299 square feet. Only flood resistant materials shall be used below the required flood elevation specified in section 29-82. One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in section 29-82. 
Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
(a)  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood. 
(b)  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). The water loading shall be those values associated with the base flood. The wind loading values shall be those required by applicable IBC International Building Code. 
(c)  Such enclosed space shall be useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation, finished or partitioned into multiple rooms, or temperature-controlled. 
(9)  No manufactured homes shall be permitted except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and elevation standards of section 29-82(3). 
(10)  Recreational vehicles shall be permitted in coastal high hazard areas provided that they meet the recreational vehicle criteria of section 29-82(6) and the temporary structure provisions of section 29-86(11). 
(11)  Accessory structures, below the required lowest floor elevation specified in section 29-86(2), are prohibited except for the following: 
(a)  Swimming pools. 
1.  They are installed at-grade or elevated so long as the pool will not act as an obstruction. 
2.  They must be structurally independent of the building and its foundation. 
3.  They may be placed beneath a coastal building only if the top of the pool and any accompanying decking or walkway are flush with the existing grade and only if the lower area remains unenclosed. 
4.  As part of the certification process for V zone buildings the design professional must consider the effects that any of these elements will have on the building in question and any nearby buildings. 
(b)  Access stairs attached to or beneath an elevated building: 
1.  Must be constructed of flood-resistant materials. 
2.  Must be constructed as open staircases so they do not block flow under the structure in accordance with section 29-86(2). 
(c)  Decks. 
1.  If the deck is structurally attached to a building then the bottom of the lowest horizontal member must be at or above the elevation of the buildings lowest horizontal member. 
2.  If the deck is to be built below the BFE then it must be structurally independent of the main building and must not cause an obstruction. 
3.  If an at-grade, structurally independent deck is proposed then a design professional must evaluate the design to determine if it will adversely affect the building and nearby buildings. 
(12)  Parking areas should be located on a stable grade under or landward of a structure. Any parking surface shall consist of gravel or aggregate. 
(13)  Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of base flood event plus N/A feet. This requirement does not exclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses, etc., as long as cut off devices and back flow prevention devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to the building. No utilities or components shall be attached to breakaway walls.

(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(9)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and 
(10)  Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available.

(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-118. - Floodways. 
    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In order to ensure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the variance is granted the applicant must provide a bond for 100 percent of the cost to perform the development. 
(Ord. No. 17-0814-3, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 29-119. - Conditions. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. The following conditions shall apply to all variances: 
(1)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  The local floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this article. Violations must be corrected in accordance with section 29-65(5) of this article.

c.  They should have a reasonable relationship to the foreseeable movement desired, parking and community facilities, and should be safe, secure and attractive. 
d.  Potential pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular conflicts should be minimized in laying out such a system. 
e.  Pedestrian circulation systems should be selected so as to have minimum practical change in grade (elevation) throughout their lengths. 
f.  It must be demonstrated that adequate provisions are made to maintain the pedestrian system on an ongoing basis. 
g.  The pedestrian system surface and design must be consistent with the provisions as set forth in the city's specifications, standard drawings and street design references. 
(3)  A pedestrian system shall be provided where required by the planning commission for safety, i.e., access to recreational and educational facilities. 
(b)  Design specifications. Sidewalks shall be placed parallel to streets, with exceptions permitted to preserve natural features or to provide visual interest where required for pedestrian safety. There shall be a minimum distance of 36 inches between the back of curbing to the edge of sidewalk to provide an area for a planting strip and buffer from vehicular traffic. 
(c)  Construction specifications. 
(1)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be four inches thick except at points of vehicular crossing where they shall be at least six inches thick. At vehicular crossings, sidewalks shall be reinforced with welded wire fabric mesh or an equivalent.

a.  Whenever a sidewalk is constructed between an adjoining substantial structure on one side and curbing on the other side, an expansion joint shall be formed adjacent to the curbing. 
b.  An expansion joint shall be placed between the sidewalk and the radius curbing at street intersections. 
c.  When sidewalks are constructed adjacent to existing or new pavements or structures, expansion joints shall be placed to match these existing joints. 
d.  Sidewalks shall be installed in accord with Section 720 of the Standard Specifications for Highway Construction Manual, Latest Edition, as amended. 
(3)  Contraction joints. The concrete slabs in sidewalks between expansion joints shall be divided into blocks ten feet in length by scoring transversely after floating operations are complete. Whenever the sidewalk slabs are more than ten feet in width, they shall be scored longitudinally in the center. All scoring shall extend for a depth of one inch and shall not be less than one-quarter inch or more than one-half inch in width. All scoring shall be edged and finished smooth and true in line. 
(4)  Plantings and ground cover. Graded areas shall be planted with grass or treated with other suitable ground cover, and their width shall correspond to that of sidewalks. 
(d)  Bonding requirements. The bond requirement for sidewalk is 150 percent of the estimated construction costs for the all sidewalks required by the provisions of this chapter. The contractor may secure the bond to allow for installation at the closing stages of phase or complete development of the project. The contractor must secure approval from the city engineer, and the director of public works to bond sidewalk installation and improvements. The bonding procedure is outlined in article VI of this chapter, which pertains to improvement guarantees.

(b)  Grease interceptors to be installed shall be in conformance with the International Plumbing Code as adopted by the City of Liberty and the City of Liberty City Code. The required interceptor shall be determined by the public works departments and the building official with jurisdiction upon review of the proposed facility and sized according to requirements of the applicable codes and to the manufacturers recommendations. No interceptor shall allow a wastewater discharge concentration of greater than 325 mg/l, as identified by EPA method 1664A (if hexane is used), or 275 mg/l as identified by EPA method 413.1 (if Freon is used). The interceptor shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil interceptors shall be cleaned on a regular basis as specified by the interceptor manufacturer based on size of the facility and type of food served, whichever is the most stringent, but in no case less frequently than once every 180 days. 
(c)  All grease and oil interceptors shall provide a minimum of 12 minutes' retention time at theoretical peak flow rate. Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperatures. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable covers which, when bolted in place shall be gastight and watertight. Each user shall provide protection against accidental discharge of grease and oil. Features which prevent accidental discharge of these materials shall be provided and maintained at the users' expense. Facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City of Liberty Public Works Department and the building code official with jurisdiction for review and approval prior to construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the City of Liberty Public Works Department and the building official with jurisdiction shall not relieve the user of the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(d)  Grease and oil interceptors shall be required within two months of the adoption of sections 53-16 through 53-18, at all facilities which provide food service and/or preparation activities, including, but not limited to, full service restaurants, fast food establishments, delis, cafeterias, and school facilities where commercial equipment is installed, meat distributors, food processing facilities, grocery stores with food preparation/service areas, bakeries, caterers, and/or other similar types of operations. 
(e)  All facilities with a grease trap may be tested periodically to ensure compliance. Testing may be unannounced and may be conducted by an independent testing organization engaged by the City of Liberty. The cost for such testing shall be at the facility's expense. 
A food service and/or preparation facility, which demonstrates that the discharge from its food service and/or preparation activities contains less than 100 mg/l of grease, may receive an exemption from minimum sizing requirements or installation and maintenance requirements. The sampling and testing to demonstrate the concentration of grease in the discharge must be conducted, at the facility's expense, by an independent testing organization and measured in accordance with the analytical test procedures established in 40 CFR 136 as amended from time to time. 
When testing indicates a facility is in compliance with the established discharge limits for grease and oil, testing will occur twice each calendar year. When testing indicates a facility is not in compliance with the established discharge limits for grease and oil, testing will occur monthly until such time as the facility returns to compliance. Following three consecutive years of semi-annual testing with no violations, frequency of testing will decrease to once per year. 
(f)  Grease and oil interceptors shall be cleaned on a regular basis which will ensure proper and efficient operation but not less than one time within a 180-day period. Approved internal or under-counter interceptors shall be cleaned at least once per week. Cleaning shall consist of removal of the entire contents of the device, including grease cap and sludge pocket, and inspection of the empty device for defects and/or obstructions which would prevent proper function. 
(g)  Written records shall be maintained by the user indicating maintenance and cleaning of the grease interceptor. The record shall indicate: dates of maintenance; person performing maintenance; estimated volume of grease removed; receipts or manifest from haulers; disposal locations; facility manager's verification. The records shall be maintained for a period of three years and shall be available at the facility along with a copy of the grease interceptor permit for inspection by the City of Liberty Public Works Department and utility provider, if applicable. 
(Ord. No. 06-0202, 3-13-2006) 
Sec. 53-18. - Fines. 
(a)  When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the DPW may direct the police department to fine such user in an amount not to exceed $2,000.00, pursuant to S.C. Code 1976, § 6-11-285, as amended, and in SCDHEC regulation 61-72, per day per violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis, with each violation occurring on each day being considered a separate and distinct violation. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(b)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, draw interest at the legal rate then prevailing on civil judgments. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties. 
(c)  The director may, through appropriate civil suit, recover the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city will be added to the fine. 
(d)  In determining the amount of the fine, relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factors shall be taken into account. 
(e)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the municipal judge to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. 
(f)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Liability for stoppage, damage, or abuse. All users using the public sewer shall be responsible for any stoppage or damage caused by abuse of the sewer system through the sewer connection of that user and shall be held accountable for all expenses incurred by the city or other property owners as a result of the abuse. 
(h)  Record keeping. Maintenance and cleaning events must be recorded on a form provided by the City of Liberty and kept on file on site. Receipts or manifests from private pumping septic and grease haulers should indicate destination of hauled waste. The records shall be made available to inspectors upon request. Maintenance records shall contain the following information:

ARTICLE III. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY 

Sec. 53-51. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The city is a designated SMS4 and is required by state and federal laws to control and reduce stormwater runoff and associated pollutants. The management of stormwater runoff and sediment is necessary to reduce pollution, siltation, sedimentation, local flooding and stream channel erosion, all of which impact adversely on land and water resources and the health, safety, property and welfare of the residents of the city. 
(b)  The city maintains a system of stormwater management facilities, including but not limited to, inlets, conduits, manholes, channels, ditches, drainage easements, infiltration facilities, and other components, as well as natural waterways. 
(c)  The stormwater management facilities and components of the city need to be regularly maintained, rehabilitated, upgraded or expanded, and additional stormwater management facilities and measures need to be installed throughout the city. 
(d)  There are chronic drainage problems in numerous areas of the city which, on an annual basis, threaten property, limit access to property, create unpredictable driving conditions and present a negative image of the city's ability to address community problems. 
(e)  There is no comprehensive mapping system or base line data to assist in analysis, design and/or development of comprehensive maintenance and retrofit programs, and there is no long term comprehensive drainage infrastructure maintenance program/plan in the city. 
(f)  There is a lack of resources (equipment, manpower, funds) in the city to address problems comprehensively and within a defined time frame. 
(g)  The city is a community comprised of citizens with a wide range of incomes with varying means to afford government services. 
(h)  In the city, current and anticipated growth will contribute to the need for improvements in, and maintenance of, the stormwater management system. 
(i)  The city needs to upgrade its capability to maintain existing and future stormwater management facilities and measures. 
(j)  Every parcel of real property in the city either uses or benefits from the stormwater management system, and the improvement of existing facilities and construction of additional facilities in the system will directly or indirectly benefit the owners of all real property. 
(k)  The extent of use of the stormwater management system by each classification of real property is dependent on a variety of factors that influence runoff, such as land use, topography, intensity of development, amount of impervious surface, and location in a particular watershed or basin. 
(l)  Property owners and users should finance the stormwater management system to the extent they contribute to the need for the system and to the extent they benefit from the system, and charges therefore should bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of the service, and every effort should be made to fairly and reasonably spread the cost of the system to all property owners and users. 
(m)  Creating a permanent stormwater management utility requires stormwater management utility fees and classifications be established thereunder. 
(n)  In general, two methods for determining rates/fees are widely used: impervious area method and intensity of development method. Both rate structures attempt to provide a fair, equitable and cost-effective method of financing the utility. The city has evaluated the two methods for determining rate structures and has decided to use a modified version of the intensity of development method as detailed in this chapter, and believes this decision to be in the best interests of the community and environment. 
(o)  After careful review, a base rate in the amount of $24.00 per year is determined to be fair and reasonable, and in the best interests of the community. 
(p)  It is in the best interests of the citizens of this city and, most specifically, the owners of real property, that a stormwater management utility with fees and classifications thereunder be established by ordinance and implemented as part of the city's utility enterprise system as authorized by S.C. Code 1976, § 48-14-10 et seq. and specifically § 48-14-120, § 5-7-30, and other relevant laws and regulations of the state. 
(q)  In accordance with state and federal laws and regulations the requirements applicable to designated SMS4s and the city will become more stringent since municipal compliance is an iterative process. Therefore, the creation of a stormwater management utility, that provides for a source of funding, will ensure that the city attains compliance with the state and federal requirements. The failure to attain compliance with applicable state and federal requirements will subject the city to fines, penalties and liabilities under the Clean Water Act.

(Ord. No. 12-0401, 5-7-2012) 
Sec. 53-54. - Stormwater management utility established; duties and powers. 
(a)  Establishment. The council hereby establishes a stormwater management utility (also called "utility" in this article) to carry out the purposes, functions and responsibilities herein set forth. The governing body of the utility shall be the mayor and council. The stormwater manager shall administer the utility under the engineering division of the department of planning and development. The utility shall have the powers and duties set out in division (b) of this section, which powers are not necessarily exclusive to the utility. 
(b)  Duties and powers. The stormwater management utility shall have the following duties and powers: 
(1)  Stormwater management planning and preparation of comprehensive watershed master plans for stormwater management. 
(2)  Regular inspections of public and private stormwater management facilities and measures and the construction thereof. 
(3)  Maintenance and improvement of stormwater management facilities that have been accepted by the city for that purpose. 
(4)  Plan review and inspection of stormwater management plans, measures, and practices.

(Ord. No. 12-0401, 5-7-2012) 
Sec. 53-57. - Stormwater utility fees. 
(a)  The council shall establish by ordinance the amounts and classifications of stormwater management utility fees to be implemented to help fund the utility and its programs and projects. 
(b)  The council shall consider, among other things, the following criteria in establishing fees: 
(1)  The fee system must be reasonable and equitable so that property owners and users pay to the extent they contribute to the need for and benefit from the utility, and the fees must bear a substantial relationship to the cost of the service. The fees shall be apportioned with approximate equality and upon a reasonable basis of equality with due regard for the benefits conferred. The council recognizes that these benefits, while substantial, in many cases cannot be measured directly. 
(2)  Cost analysis, construction, maintenance, and the overall operation of the stormwater system should be borne equally by all classifications of property owners in the city, in that all will enjoy the direct and indirect benefits of an improved and well-maintained system. 
(3)  Any fee established should be in an amount that is reasonable and equitable and not unduly burdensome on each property owner and user. 
(4)  The components of the calculations used to establish fees may include, but shall not be limited to, the following cost factors: 
a.  Stormwater management planning and preparation of comprehensive watershed master plans for stormwater management; 
b.  Regular inspections of public and private stormwater management facilities and measures and the construction thereof; 
c.  Maintenance and improvement of stormwater management facilities that have been accepted by the city for that purpose; 
d.  Plan review and inspection of stormwater management plans, measures, and practices; 
e.  Retrofitting designated watersheds to reduce existing flooding problems or to improve water quality; 
f.  Acquisition of interests in land, including easements; 
g.  Design and construction of stormwater management facilities and measures and acquisition of equipment;

a.  Commercial and land uses other than single-family residential; 
b.  Vacant and/or undeveloped land; 
c.  Imperviousness of land as it relates to the intensity of development as derived from use classifications hereof; and 
d.  Other generally accepted factors relevant to such calculations based upon the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 12-0401, 5-7-2012) 
Sec. 53-58. - Classification of property and determination of fee. 
(a)  Classification. For purposes of determining the fee, all properties in the city are classified as follows: 
(1)  Single-family residential property: R-12, R-10, R-8. 
(2)  Agricultural residential property. Agricultural residential property is exempt from the fees determined herein if the property is being used for production of plants and animals useful to man. Any construction on agricultural residential property that requires the issuance of a building permit is subject to the requirements of this article. 
(3)  Commercial property, including but not limited to the following classifications: CBD, GBD, NBD, RLI, GI. 
(4)  Recreation facilities, parks, golf courses and appurtenances thereto. 
(5)  Multifamily property: RM-8, RM-16, MHP. 
(6)  Mixed use property. 
(7)  Undeveloped property. 
(b)  Base rate . The base rate shall be $24.00 per year. For purposes of this article, a year shall coincide with the county's property tax billing year, from January 1 of the current year through December 31. 
(c)  ERU . One commonly accepted rate unit for stormwater utilities is the equivalent residential unit (ERU). This is a descriptive value based on the total gross land area and the amount of impervious surface. The ERU is used to relate a rate charged for a typical residential property, and this becomes the common denominator by which all other classifications of properties are evaluated. In general, there are two principal methods used to assign values for impervious surfaces: actual amounts of impervious surface on a parcel can be physically measured, or accepted land use coefficients can be used to relate imperviousness to the intensity of development. The latter method is adopted herein. Pursuant to this chapter, an ERU is considered to be a single-family lot less than or equal to 20,000 square feet. The run-off coefficient assigned to the ERU is 0.36. The run-off coefficients assigned to the classifications are as follows: 
(1)  Single-family residential (SF1) ..... 0.25 
(2)  Residential (R-8, R-10, R-12) ..... 0.25 
(3)  Low/high density multifamily (RM-8, RM-16, MHP) ..... 0.56 
(4)  Neighborhood business district (NBD) ..... 0.60 
(5)  Central business district (CBD) ..... 0.86 
(6)  General business district (GBD) ..... 0.86 
(7)  General industrial (GI, RLI) ..... 0.73 
(d)  Computation of stormwater utility fee and example calculation . 
(1)  Computation of stormwater utility fee . 
a.  Determine rate to assign ERU. 
b.  Equate base range (0-0.5 ac) of commercial to the ERU. 
c.  Assign area ranges for commercial zones. 
d.  Calculate ratios for parcels >0.5 ac based on area. 
e.  Using the ratios calculated in (d)(1)d., multiply by base rate to obtain the yearly fee. 
(2)  Example calculation. In order to find the fee for 2.75 ac property in a GBD zone: 
a.  ERU = $24.00/year. 
b.  Ratio of GBD to ERU 0.86/0.36 = 2.39. Therefore, a parcel </=20,000 sf has a ratio of 2.39. 
c.  The property (2.75 ac) falls within the assigned area of 2.1-5.0 ac. 
d.  Multiply ratio by average value for this range: 2.39/.5 × 3.55 = 16.97. 
e.  Compute fee based on ERU: 16.97 × $24.00 = $407.28/year. 
(e)  Stormwater utility fee: assigned ratios based on "C" factors and acreage .

Parcels larger than 30 ac based on actual acreage. 
*Note: Average area within each range is used to determine ratio. 
(f)  Annual fees. Annual fees for all property, whether occupied or vacant, shall be as follows: 
(1)  Single-family residential property . Single-family residential property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times one equivalent residential unit (ERU), regardless of the size of the parcel or the improvements. 
(2)  Agricultural residential property. Agricultural residential property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times one equivalent residential unit (ERU), regardless of the size of the parcel or the improvements. Provided, however, that land disturbance activities on agricultural residential property for the production of plants and animals useful to man are exempt from the requirements of this article. Any construction on agricultural residential property that requires the issuance of a building permit is subject to the requirements of this article. 
(3)  Commercial property. The intensity of development factor is greater than the single-family unit used as the base ERU because of the amount of impervious area. Pursuant to generally accepted engineering data, the run-off coefficient or C-factor for commercial property has been determined to be as set forth below in (3)a. through e. An equation is used to relate the run-off coefficient of the multi-family property to the base ERU. This equation is then multiplied by the average acreage for the appropriate size range of the property in question. The determined ratio is then multiplied by the base rate to determine the yearly fee. 
a.  Light industrial (RLI, GI) ..... 0.73 
b.  Neighborhood business district (NBD) ..... 0.60 
c.  Central business district (CBD) ..... 0.86 
d.  General business district (GBD) ..... 0.86 
e.  Multifamily (RM-8, RM-16, MHP) ..... 0.56 
(4)  Undeveloped property. Undeveloped property shall be charged one-half of the ERU base rate. Pursuant to generally accepted engineering data, the run-off coefficient is approximately one-half of the run-off coefficient for the ERU definition stated herein. 
(5)  Recreation facilities, parks, golf courses, and appurtenances thereto. Recreation facilities, parks, and golf courses shall be charged one-half of the ERU base rate for each individual tax parcel. Clubhouses, tennis and pool facilities, and appurtenances thereto shall be billed at the appropriate rate as previously defined in this section under division (e). 
(g)  Minimum fee. 
(1)  All dwelling units within the city that have been assigned a tax map number by the county shall be charged the base rate multiplied by one ERU. 
(2)  All non-residential/commercial property within the city that has been assigned an individual tax map number by the county shall be charged a minimum fee based upon a parcel size of less than one-half acre within the applicable zoning classification, or a fee based upon an actual calculation as prescribed by this chapter, whichever is greater.

Section 512. - Planned Development District. 
512.1 Intent of District. The PDD district is established to encourage innovative and creative design of residential and/or commercial developments and to permit a greater amount of flexibility to a developer by removing some of the restrictions of conventional zoning. It is the intent of the district that such design and planning features be incorporated properly into all PDD districts hereafter created, and that the Planning Commission shall consider the existence and appropriateness of such features before any amendment to the Zoning Map is adopted to create such districts. The district is also intended to encourage developments that provide a full range of residential types to serve the inhabitants of the district. The regulations provide a mechanism to evaluate each application on its own merit. It is recognized that some concepts will be more successful than others and the approval of an application in one situation does not necessarily indicate the development will be applicable in other situations. It is emphasized that these provisions are not to be confused with nor designed to circumvent the intent or use of conventional zoning classifications as set forth in this ordinance. 
A planned residential development is not intended to encourage greater density of development but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning, and to ensure the provision of park and recreation land and facilities for use of occupants in order to obtain a more desirable environment. 
512.2 Types of Planned Development Districts. Two types of planned development districts accommodating primarily residential and/or nonresidential uses are created as follows: 
a)  PDD-R Planned Unit Development - Residential: The PDD-R district is intended to accommodate primarily residential uses, with non-residential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses. 
b)  PDD-C Planned Unit Development - Commercial: The PDD-C district is intended to accommodate primarily non-residential uses, with residential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses. 
512.3 Minimum Area. The minimum area of a PDD shall be ten (10) contiguous acres to be under the control of a single developer or entity at the time of zoning approval. 
512.4 Maximum Area of Commercial or Service Uses. In PDD-R districts in which commercial or service uses are permitted, the area of land devoted to such uses, including structures, parking, and related characteristics and accessory uses thereto shall not exceed the following percentages for any specific site size: 
Site Size in Acres Maximum Percentage of 
Commercial or Service [Uses] 0 but less than 25 20 25 but less than 50 30 50 but less than 80 40 80 or more 50  
Provided, however, that these percentages shall apply only to commercial and service uses, and not to other non-residential uses such as schools, parks, community buildings, or public facilities. Required parking for commercial and service uses shall be counted towards maximum percentages. 
512.5 Permitted Accessory Uses and Structures. Accessory uses and structures shall not be permitted in residential segments of planned unit developments. 
512.6 Uses and Structures Permitted Upon Review. No review action by the Board of Adjustments is required to establish any specific use. Uses and structures permitted in the least restrictive land use classifications indicated in Section 511.3 for any specific site size are permitted outright, provided, however, that the Planning Commission shall ascertain that the effect and benefit usually derived from safeguards and conditions normally imposed upon uses permitted by review. 
512.7 Minimum Lot Area. No minimum lot area is required for any specific structure. 
512.8 Minimum Lot Width, Minimum Yard Requirements, Maximum Lot Coverage, Maximum Height of Structures. No structure shall be erected within twenty-five (25) feet from any external lot line of any planned development. Minimum lot width, minimum yard sizes, maximum lot coverage, and maximum height are not otherwise regulated within PDD districts, provided, however, that the Planning Commission shall ascertain that the characteristics of building siting shall be appropriate as related to structures within the planned unit development and otherwise fulfill the intent of this ordinance. 
512.9 Minimum Off-Street Parking and Loading. The Planning Commission shall not approve a PDD site plan until the Building Inspector has reviewed and approved a parking scheme for the development. 
512.10 Amenity Area. Each PDD with a residential component shall be provided with a public common area of at least one (1) acre in size, plus four hundred (400) square feet for each dwelling unit above twenty (20). Such common area shall be developed by the person, entity, corporation or developer developing the PDD and shall be deeded over to a neighborhood association within one (1) year after all units are sold. Such common area shall be completed before seventy-five percent (75%) of the occupancy permits for the total number of proposed units are issued. Such common area may be maintained as open space or may include recreational features such as tennis courts, a swimming pool, a clubhouse or similar facilities. 
512.11 Each PDD development shall be serviced by sidewalks in the public right-of-way to be located parallel to the front yard lines of each lot in the PDD. Said sidewalks shall be installed by the developer of the PDD. 
512.12 Utilities Requirements. Each lot within a PDD development shall be serviced by underground utilities. 
512.13 Spacing Requirements. All residential structures within a PDD shall be spaced a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from any other residential structures.

512.20 Changes to Planned Development Districts. Changes to a proposed Planned Development District or to an approved Planned Development District may be permitted in accordance with one of the following procedures as determined by the Zoning Administrator. 
1.  Minor Changes - Changes to a Planned Development District which are of a design nature and which do not alter the original concept or use characteristics of the Planned Development District may be approved by the Planning Commission in accordance with the procedures established by Section 512.14, except that no minor change may be approved by the Planning Commission which is in conflict with specific conceptual considerations previously contained in City Council's preliminary approval. 
2.  Major Changes - Changes to a Planned Development District which would alter the basic concept and general characteristics of the Planned Development District may be approved by City Council in accordance with the procedures established by Section 512.15. Examples of major changes include but are not limited to the following: boundary changes, changes in the maximum number of structures or residential units; increased density; substantial changes to residential housing type; use changes; access changes, etc. Approval of a major change by City Council must be followed by final approval of a detailed design plan showing such changes as approved by the Planning Commission in accordance with Section 512.6. 
512.21 Failure To Begin, Failure To Complete, of [or] Failure To Make Adequate Progress. One year after final approval and each year thereafter, the Zoning Administrator shall present to the Planning Commission a status report on the progress of an approved development.

The fee shall be used by the City of Liberty to retain an engineer, planning consultant, or other such professional to assist in the review of the preliminary plan, amendments to the plan and/or final plan. Upon completion of the project any unused portion of the application fee shall be refunded to the applicant. 
512.25 Prohibited Uses. Sexually Oriented Businesses (see Liberty Ordinance 0102) and mobile homes. 
Section 513. - Overlay Districts. 
The purposes of the Overlay Districts are to promote economic development and provide for a safe, clean, attractive environment in key areas of the city. Overlay Districts include regulations to protect the heritage of Liberty and to provide development standards and guidelines that will result in quality development in the city center, as well as along key entryways into the community. 
An overlay district is a separate set of regulations applicable only to a specific geographic area. An Overlay District may grant additional uses, restrict permitted uses, or impose development requirements differing from those in the underlying zoning district. The underlying zoning district and overlay districts together will control development. Overlay district designations are established below. 
513.1 Overlay Districts Identified. 
City Center Overlay District: The City Center Overlay District shall apply to all parcels zoned Section 509 Core Commercial. 
Commercial and Industrial Overlay Districts: Applies to the following Zoning Districts: 
502 & 503 Multiple family 
506 Office Commercial 
507 Neighborhood Commercial 
508 General Commercial 
510 Limited Industrial 
511 Basic Industrial 
513.2 City Center Overlay District. The City Center Design Overlay is designed to encourage the redevelopment and expansion of the traditional City center. 
Downtowns traditionally form near the convergence of large, coherent neighborhoods. The downtown should provide higher-density, balanced growth of workplaces, commerce, and residential opportunities. The area should balance the needs of pedestrians and automobiles. Increased street connectivity and accessibility in this area is important since it is the community's commercial, civic, and cultural hub. While allowing an array of permitted building types, the district encourages mixed uses, new development in this area should retain and reinforce the area as the commercial center of the City. Transitions from residential neighborhood areas should be accomplished through architectural design and streetscape treatment. Individual buildings are encouraged to be mixed vertically with street level commercial and upper level residential. Higher densities of residential development are encouraged. 
513.3 Commercial and Industrial Overlay Districts. The Commercial and Industrial Design Overlay Districts are designed to promote a quality impression of the community, and to provide integration between existing or established neighborhoods and market driven pressures for increased mixed-use development resulting from the location of transportation infrastructure in adjacent areas. Corridors of mixed-use buildings typically form entryways into the formalized City Center and promote a higher level of commercial development due to the presence of transportation infrastructure and high traffic volumes. These districts permit the construction of various scales of commercial activity along the transportation corridors. The intent of this section is to facilitate mixed-use development that will provide convenient access, minimize traffic congestion, and reduce visual clutter along the commercial and industrial districts in Liberty. 
The architectural guidelines detailed in this section are enumerated to permit the construction of various building types that relate to the character of the Liberty area, in order to preserve the architectural heritage of Liberty. 
513.4 Application of Overlay District Regulations. The design review regulations in this article shall apply to the right to erect, demolish, remove in whole or in part, or alter the exterior appearance of buildings and structures located within overlay districts. Within overlay districts, a certificate of approval is required before any permit for a particular project can be issued. The certificate of approval is based entirely upon the approval of, and any conditions established by, the City of Liberty Board of Architectural Review (Board). 
513.5 Exceptions to Overlay District Requirements. These regulations shall not apply to: 
1.  Temporary uses or structures permitted by district regulations; 
2.  Ordinary maintenance, painting, or repair which does not require a building permit; 
3.  Demolition of any structure which the building official certifies, in writing, to the Board, is required to protect the public from unsafe or dangerous conditions. 
513.6 Board of Architectural Review Established; Organization. 
1.  A Board of Architectural Review (Board) is established to review proposals within architectural review districts. The Board shall consist of five (5) members appointed by the city council. The officers shall be elected for one year terms at the first meeting of each calendar year. Any vacancy in membership shall be filled for the unexpired term by the city council, which shall have the authority to remove any member for cause. No member of the commission may hold another public office position in the city. 
2.  The board shall be composed of professionals from among the following fields: architecture, landscape architecture, horticulture, building construction, engineering, and urban planning. 
3.  The board shall elect annually a chair and vice-chair from among its members. It shall adopt bylaws and rules of procedure and keep a record of its proceedings in accordance with state law and these regulations. Minutes of meetings shall state the reasons for granting or denying certificates of approval. 
4.  Three (3) members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of business. The members shall serve without compensation, except for reimbursement for authorized expenses attendant to the performance of their duties. The Board shall meet at the call of the chair or at such regular intervals as determined by the Board. Meetings shall comply with the Freedom of Information Act, S.C. Code 1976, § 30-4-10 et seq. 
513.7 Powers and Duties of the Board. 
1.  The Board of Architectural Review shall review applications for permits for the following activities within overlay districts: 
A.  All new buildings and structures, excluding single-family residential development and existing exterior signs for existing commercial buildings; 
B.  All changes of use from a residential use to a nonresidential use; 
C.  Any alteration that increases the total impervious site area or gross floor area of a building; 
D.  All new exterior signs; 
E.  All exterior alterations to any non-single family residential structure. 
2.  The Board shall issue a certificate of approval for activities which comply with the applicable standards. 
3.  The Board may initiate zoning text amendments pertaining to this article. 
4.  The Board, by rules of procedure, may delegate to the zoning administrator the authority to approve specified activities, as outlined in this section, which meet all applicable standards in this chapter without review by the Board, subject to appeal to the Board as provided in this article. 
5.  The Board may grant an exception from the strict application of architectural review standards to a particular parcel or structure, that would result in unnecessary hardship, and that the property or structure to be protected and the alternative site planning and building design approach meet the same design objectives; and the character of the district will not be harmed by the variance. In granting a variance of architectural review standards, the Board may attach reasonable conditions in conformity with the purpose of this article. 
513.8 Overlay Design Guidelines, General. The design guidelines listed in this section shall apply to all overlay districts in the city. 
1.  The natural terrain and landscape shall be preserved and protected, where feasible. Trees and shrubs shall not be destroyed indiscriminately. 
2.  Scale, location, form, line, color, texture, and other design elements of buildings, structures, and signs shall be in harmony with the character of the district. 
3.  Exterior lighting shall be used for safety and comply with Liberty's design. 
4.  Open space, parking, pedestrian walks, signs, illumination, and landscaping shall relate to the site and shall provide safe and efficient development with minimum impact on adjoining districts. 
5.  Electrical and mechanical equipment, refuse, and storage areas shall be concealed or screened from view. 
6.  Applications shall not be approved for projects which will result in aesthetically objectionable structures not in harmony with existing uses in the district. 
7.  Proposed development which adversely impacts surrounding property values by reason of factors subject to architectural review shall not be approved. 
8.  Signs and advertising form shall be restrained and not detract from the sense of a continuous landscape. 
9.  A diversity of architectural styles is encouraged, but individual buildings shall not exhibit arresting or spectacular effects; violent contrasts of materials or colors and intense or lurid colors; a multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance, the absence of unity and coherence in composition not in consonance with the dignity and character of the environs. Materials and colors shall be compatible with natural features and existing buildings in the immediate area of the project. 
10.  Preservation of history. The appearance of new structures must be compatible with structures which remain from earlier periods. 
11.  Preservation of natural areas. Site development shall minimize impact on natural or scenic areas. 
12.  Structures shall have a scale compatible with district uses. 
513.9 Overlay Guidelines Specific to the City Center Overlay District. 
1.  Architectural style. New buildings should be designed to be respectful in context to the existing built environment, not as explicit reproductions of past historical styles. This regulation does not preclude use of materials, scale or massing found on older buildings. Spatial elements like massing, proportions, scale, setbacks, spaces between buildings, and their relative positions should be used to integrate new buildings into the existing environment. 
Buildings that are stylized in an attempt to use the building itself as advertising should be discouraged, particularly where the proposed architecture is the result of a "corporate" or franchise style. New construction should provide variety and diversity and express its own uniqueness of structure, location or tenant. 
2.  Scale and proportion. The patterns, sizes, and shapes of elements, materials, and openings all influence a building's scale. Two important considerations are how these elements relate to human size and how they relate to each other in terms of scale. Proportion is the relationship of one dimension to another and creates visual order among the elements of a building. 
Height can lend a building dignity and grace. Conversely, it can contribute to unacceptable bulk and dominance. It is the height in combination with other features that results in a positive or negative outcome. The height and scale of each building should take into consideration its site and existing (or anticipated) neighboring buildings. 
Windows, doors, columns, eaves, parapets, and other building components should be proportional to the overall scale of the building. Changes of plane should have clearly delineated material transitions. 
3.  Façade articulation and detailing. Buildings serve to spatially define streets. Proper spatial definition is achieved with buildings or other architectural elements that make up street edges aligned in a disciplined manner with an appropriate ratio of height to width. 
Architectural elements like openings, sill details, bulkhead, posts, and other architectural features should be used to establish human scale at the street level. Buildings should avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes on their visible facades. Building wall offsets, including projections, recesses, and changes in floor level should be used in order to: add architectural interest and variety; relieve the visual effect of a single, long wall; and subdivide the wall into human size proportions. Similarly, roofline offsets should be provided to lend architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single, long roof. For larger scale developments, the building façade should create repetitive bays, or the façades should be divided into a balanced, yet asymmetrical, composition. 
All sides of the building should use materials consistent with those on the front if visible from public streets or neighboring properties, and should be carefully designed with similar detailing, and be comparable in quality and materials. 
4.  Roof Form and Pitch. The character of the roof is a major feature of all buildings. When repeated along the street, the repetition of similar roof forms also contributes to the sense of visual continuity. In each case, the roof pitch, its materials, size and orientation are all important to the overall character of the building. New construction should not break from this continuity. New structures and their roofs should be similar in character to their neighbors. 
5.  Window and Door Proportions and Design. The location of window of [or] door size and location also contributes to a sense of visual continuity along the street. In order to maintain this sense of visual continuity, a new building should maintain the basic window and door proportions and placement seen traditionally. 
6.  Signs. A sign typically serves two functions: first, to attract attention, and second to convey information, essentially identifying the business or services offered within. If it is well designed, a building front alone can serve the attention-getting function, allowing the sign to be focused on conveying information in a well-conceived manner. All new signs should be developed with the overall context of the building and of the area in mind. 
7.  Building Materials and Color. Building materials of new structures should contribute to the visual continuity of the city center area. They should appear similar to those in existence to establish a sense of visual continuity. While color in itself does not affect the actual form of a building, it can dramatically affect the perceived scale of a structure and it can help to blend a building with its context. 
Building materials should be similar to the materials already being used in the city center area, or if dissimilar materials are being proposed, other characteristics such as scale and proportion, form, architectural detailing or color and texture, should be used to ensure that enough similarity exists for the building to relate to its surroundings. 
Materials should be selected for suitability to the type of building and design for which they are used. Material or color changes at outside corners of structures, which give the impression of "thinness" and artificiality, are prohibited. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material should be avoided. Metal buildings should be prohibited. 
Commercial building walls should be composed of brick, cast concrete, stucco, stone, marble, or other materials similar in appearance and durability and in keeping with the traditional architecture of the area. Decorative concrete block may be used on building walls not visible from a public street or as an accent material only. All accessory buildings shall be clad in materials similar in appearance to the principal structure. 
8.  Mechanical Screening. Utilities that serve properties may include telephone and electrical lines, ventilation systems, utility meters, mechanical equipment, transformers, generators, air conditioners, and similar features or other utility hardware. Adequate space for these utilities should be planned in a project from the outset and they should be designed such that their visual impacts are minimized. Service areas for trash, recycling containers, loading facilities, and site maintenance equipment should be carefully planned as an integral part of a site. At the same time, the visual impacts of service areas should be minimized. When laying out a site, adequate provisions should be made for service areas. 
9.  Alignment. The alignment of buildings at the sidewalk's edge should be maintained by locating the front building wall at the sidewalk line when feasible. Where a building must be set back from the sidewalk, landscape elements should be used to define the sidewalk edge. 
10.  Building Adaptation. When adapting a residence to a commercial use, the residential character of the building should be respected. Seek uses that are compatible with the traditional character of the building. 
11.  New Additions and Expansions. The design of new additions or expansions should be such that the original character of the building can be clearly seen and should be compatible in scale, materials and character with the main building. An addition should not damage or obscure architecturally important features. Any rooftop addition should keep the mass and scale subordinate to the primary building and be in character with the primary structure's design. 
12.  Renovation of Existing Structures. 
A.  Changing or rebuilding 50% or more of any façade of a building requires the entire building to comply with the regulations. 
B.  Changing or rebuilding less than 50% of any façade of a building, requires only that façade to comply. 
C.  All new windows, entrances, storefronts, and doorways must be designed in accordance with these regulations. 
D.  Any addition of 50% or more of the first floor area requires the entire building to come into compliance. 
E.  Routine maintenance and repair are exempt from these requirements. 
13.  Design Guidelines for Signs. 
A.  Signs should be coordinated with the composition of the overall façade and in proportion to the building such that it does not dominate the appearance. 
B.  Signs should be located on a building such that they will emphasize design elements of the façade itself and fit within existing architectural features. 
C.  When feasible, a wall sign should be placed such that it aligns with others on the block. If decorative moldings exist that could define a sign panel, locate a flush-mounted sign to fit within the panel formed by the moldings or transom panels.

513.10 Overlay Guidelines Specific to the Commercial and Industrial Overlay Districts. 
1.  Building Materials and Color. Building materials of new structures should contribute to the visual continuity of the commercial and industrial overlay area. They should appear similar to those in existence to establish a sense of visual continuity. While color in itself does not affect the actual form of a building, it can dramatically affect the perceived scale of a structure and it can help to blend a building with its context. 
Building materials should be similar to the materials already being used in the area, or if dissimilar materials are being proposed, other characteristics such as scale and proportion, form, architectural detailing or color and texture, should be used to ensure that enough similarity exists for the building to relate to its surroundings. 
Materials should be selected for suitability to the type of building and design for which they are used. Material or color changes at outside corners of structures, which give the impression of "thinness" and artificiality, are prohibited. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material should be avoided. Metal buildings should be prohibited. 
Building walls should be composed of brick, cast concrete, stucco, stone, marble, or other materials similar in appearance and durability and in keeping with the traditional architecture of the area. Regular or decorative concrete block may be used on building walls not visible from a public street or as an accent material only. All accessory buildings shall be clad in materials similar in appearance to the principal structure. 
2.  Landscaping. Landscape design standards are as follows: 
A.  A landscape plan shall be provided for the entire site. 
B.  All trees planted in front of the front building line shall be at least two inches in diameter for single-stemmed trees, or 8 to 10 feet in height for multi-stemmed trees at the time of planting. 
C.  Existing trees having a DBH (diameter-at-breast-height, measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level) over eight inches shall be preserved unless removal is approved by the Board of Architectural Review. If a preserved tree dies, it must be replaced with a two-inch-diameter tree of the same or similar tree species, subject to approval by the zoning administrator. 
D.  Impervious materials shall not be placed over the critical root zone of a preserved tree. The critical zone is a ratio of one inch DBH to one-foot radius around the tree. 
E.  All exposed soil areas shall be covered with bark, mulch, or other weed control measures. 
F.  Canopy trees shall be planted along property lines abutting a street at a ratio of one tree for every 30 linear feet in a minimum eight-foot-wide planting strip. Trees may be clustered. 
G.  Shrubs shall be evergreen only. 
3.  Off-Street Parking. 
A.  Parking areas shall be designed as a series of smaller lots that provide space for no more than 20 cars for double-sided parking and ten cars for single-sided parking. The small parking lots shall be separated by minimum five-foot-wide internal planting areas that feature trees planted in grass or other approved landscape material. 
B.  In areas where off-street parking is provided in front of the front building line, one canopy tree shall be provided at a ratio of one tree to every five parking spaces in that area. 
C.  In areas where parking is provided behind the front building line, each parking space shall be within 50 feet of a planted or retained tree trunk. 
D.  Where slopes over five percent exist, parking bays shall be terraced, with planting between changes in level. 
E.  Where over 100 parking spaces are provided, pedestrian pathways identified with smaller scale pavement (pavers or scoring) oriented toward the principal building entrance shall be provided. 
F.  Each separate planting area shall have a minimum of 150 square feet per tree and shall have a minimum dimension of at least five feet. 
G.  In addition to required trees, planting areas shall be landscaped with shrubs, ground cover, or other approved landscaping material not exceeding 3 1/2 feet in height. 
H.  Where parking is adjacent to a public right-of-way, a six-foot-wide landscape buffer shall be provided between the edge of the right-of-way and the edge of the parking lot. In addition to the required trees, the buffer shall consist of one of the following: 
(1)  Landscape requirements: at least one shrub to every three linear feet. 
(2)  Berm requirements with a two-foot minimum height. Berms shall be planted with ground covers and shrubs. 
4.  Fencing and screening design. 
A.  Screening walls and fencing are allowed only in side and rear yards and behind the front building line, with the exception of outdoor eating and play areas. 
B.  Fencing and wall materials shall be consistent with the site and architectural design of the principal structure. 
C.  Fences and walls shall be made of masonry, ornamental metal, stucco, or a combination of these materials. 
D.  Fences or walls greater than 50 feet in length or six feet in height shall have a change in plane, height, material, or material texture, or significant landscape massing. 
5.  Mechanical Screening. Utilities that serve properties may include telephone and electrical lines, ventilation systems, utility meters, mechanical equipment, transformers, generators, air conditioners, and similar features or other utility hardware. Adequate space for these utilities should be planned in a project from the outset and they should be designed such that their visual impacts are minimized. Service areas for trash, recycling containers, loading facilities, and site maintenance equipment should be carefully planned as an integral part of a site. At the same time, the visual impacts of service areas should be minimized. When laying out a site, adequate provisions should be made for service areas. Material shall be made of masonry, metal, stucco or a combination of these materials. 
6.  Lighting. Street lighting should be used to enhance the pedestrian experience at night by providing a well-lit environment. Light pole and lamp design should be similar to those used by the City of Liberty. Streetlights should convey a pedestrian oriented scale and convey a color spectrum that is similar to daylight. Exterior lights should be used to accent architectural details, building entrances, signs, and illuminate sidewalks. Visual impacts of site and architectural lighting should be minimized through the use of low intensity white lights that are similar to daylight. Glare should be prevented by using shielded and focused light sources that focus light downward. Unshielded, high intensity light sources and those that direct light upward should not be permitted. 
7.  Design Guidelines for Signs - Article VI - Section 600 Sign Regulations. 
8.  Nonconforming Signs. Under the following conditions nonconforming signs for single or multiple businesses shall be removed or brought into conformity within thirty (30) days after written notice by the Zoning Administrator.

Section 726. - Bufferyards. 
726.1 Purpose. The purpose of the bufferyard is to ameliorate the relationship between adjacent land uses including (1) minimizing nuisances and (2) promoting compatibility. 
The bufferyard offers several options, each of which will buffer to an equivalent degree by varying distance (setback) and/or density (mass). 
726.2 Definition. A bufferyard is a permanent unit of land, together with planting, fences, berms, walls, and other screening devices required thereon. 
726.3 Location. Bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. Bufferyards shall not be located on any portion of an existing public or private right-of-way. 
726.4 Determination of Bufferyard Requirements. To determine the bufferyard required between two adjacent parcels, the following procedure shall be followed: 
(1)  Identify the proposed land use; 
(2)  Identify the use of lands adjacent to the proposed use; 
(3)  Determine the bufferyard required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the proposed land use by referring to the Table of Bufferyard Requirements and Illustrations contained in Appendix B, which specify the bufferyard options required between a proposed use and the existing adjacent uses. 
726.5 Responsibility for Bufferyard/Screening. A buffer shall be required along any property line that borders a property of less intense zoning, as specified in Appendix B. 
726.6 Bufferyard Specifications. The illustrations in Appendix B specify the type and quantity of plant materials required by each bufferyard. The requirements are stated in terms of width of the bufferyard and the number of plants required per 100 feet of bufferyard. The requirements of a bufferyard may be specified by any one of the options illustrated. The "plant unit multiplier" is a factor by which the basic number of plant materials required for a given bufferyard is determined given a change in the width of that yard. Each illustration depicts the total bufferyard required between two uses. Whenever a wall, fence, or berm is required within a bufferyard, these are shown as "structures" in the following illustrations wherein their respective specifications also are shown. 
The exact placement of required plants shall be the decision of the developer except that evergreen (or conifer) plant materials shall be planted in clusters rather than singly in order to maximize their chances of survival and increase screening. All bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn grass or suitable ground cover. 
726.7 Minimum Plant Size. Plants shall be sufficiently sized to ensure buffering and screening at the time of installation. Where the Bufferyard Illustration indicate a mass or line of plants parallel the length of the property line, the plant materials shall be sufficiently sized to ensure obscurity at the time of installation. However, seeding plants may be used where berms or structures are required as part of the bufferyard.

726.8 Bufferyard Substitutions. 
(1)  Any existing healthy, well-formed plant materials which are greater than or equal to the recommended buffer and which otherwise satisfy the requirements of this section may be counted towards satisfying all such requirements. 
(2)  Structures, where required, may be substituted with approval of the Planning Commission. 
726.9 Use of Bufferyards. A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation; however, no plant material may be removed and such use shall not be a nuisance. 
726.10 Containers and Dumpsters. All exterior dumpsters or exterior garbage containers (excluding containers of groups of containers with a combined capacity of less than six cubic yards) shall be screened on all but one side by a fence or wall, intensive landscaping, or other suitable opaque enclosure. The average height of the enclosure shall be one (1) foot more than the height of the container but shall not be required to exceed eight (8) feet in height. The open side shall not be visible from the street. 
726.11 Fences and Walls - Appearance. All fences and walls used as part of the bufferyard requirements must have a finished side facing adjoining property. The interior side of the fence or wall may be finished as the owner deems appropriate. Where fences or walls are applicable bufferyard requirements, they shall be established along the inside line of the bufferyard, toward the proposed use, except for ornamental fences, which may be built on the property line. 
726.12 Berms. Where required, berms may be located anywhere within the bufferyard, provided they parallel the property line. 
726.13 Required Maintenance. The maintenance of required bufferyards shall be the responsibility of the property owner. And all such yards shall be properly maintained so as to assure continued buffering. Failure to do so is a violation of this Ordinance, and may be remedied in the manner prescribed for violations.

Section 728. - Nuisance Abatement of Conditions Creating a Threat to the Public Health and Safety. 
(1)  It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to enforce this Article. He may enforce the provisions of this Article by the inspection of the property, investigation of complaints and observance of persons who violate any of its provisions. He may enter at any reasonable time upon public or private property to investigate conditions related to the matters covered by this chapter. 
(2)  The Zoning Administrator shall be empowered to issue a written notice when any provisions of this Article have been violated. Such notice shall allow ten (10) days from its receipt for performance of any act it requires, shall specify the manner in which the violation may be corrected, and shall state that noncompliance may result in further legal action, provided, however, that where it appears that the same owner, occupant, or person responsible has been given notice for the same violation at the same location within the previous one hundred eighty (180) days, such requirements of a ten (10) day waiting period may be waived and action commenced immediately. 
(3)  Within five (5) days following receipt of the notice, any person receiving such notice, believing that the literal application of this Article will cause undue hardship or has been misconstrued, may file a written appeal with the Construction, Maintenance and Aesthetic Board of Appeals for such relief as may grant, by way of a reasonable extension of time or relief from strict compliance with the provisions of this Article. The circumstances justifying such findings are: 
(a)  inability to immediately comply due to severe financial distress; 
(b)  the non-availability of services or equipment with which to comply, without fault of the applicant; or 
(c)  other extenuating circumstances showing a good faith intention on the part of the applicant. 
(4)  In the event that any person receiving such notice fails or refuses to correct the violation within the time prescribed, such person shall be deemed in violation of this Article. 
(5)  Such violation shall be a misdemeanor, punishable by penalty as prescribed herein. In the event such violation has not been corrected within ten (10) days as set forth above, the City of Liberty, or its agents, may go upon the property to correct the violation and the City of Liberty shall bill the owner directly for such costs (including inspection, administration, labor and equipment costs), and if not paid in full within ninety (90) days, the City shall obtain a judgment against the property owner or add the costs to the ad valorem taxes on such property. 
728.1 Notification of Violators. Service of notice to violators shall be as follows: 
(1)  by delivering personally to one or more of the following: the owner of the property, or the person responsible; 
(2)  by depositing the notice in the U.S. postal service addressed to the owner or person responsible at his last known address with the postage prepaid thereon, and certified; and 
(3)  in the event service of notice cannot be obtained in either of the above methods, by posting and keeping posted for 24 hours a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises where the violation has occurred and published once a week for three (3) weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the City such information as is necessary to inform an owner or person responsible of the location of the premises and type of offense. 
728.2 Nuisance Abatement of Conditions Creating Peril to Public Health and Safety. Whenever the Zoning Administrator shall determine that a public nuisance is such an imminent peril to the health or safety of the public or to public or private property and that the time required to follow the procedures outlined in Section [728] would seriously threaten the health or safety of the public or create injury to public or private property, the Zoning Administrator may order forthwith the abatement of such nuisances in the form of public nuisance, requiring that the public nuisance be eliminated within 72 hours, or else the party or parties responsible shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The City may use city forces or it may employ contractors when, after 72 hours, the party or parties responsible have not acted in accordance with the City's notice. Thereafter, all proceedings required by Section [728] shall be held. The City may at its option bill the owner directly for such costs (including inspections, administration, labor and equipment costs) and if not paid in full within ninety (90) days, a judgment against the property owner may be obtained. 
728.3 Immunity. No person carrying out the provisions of this Article shall be held to answer in any civil or criminal action. 
Section 729. - Property Appearance. 
729.1 Purpose. It is the intent of the City of Liberty to provide for uniform prohibition throughout the City of all litter on all public or public property, and to curb thereby the desecration of the beauty of the City and harm to the health, welfare, and safety of its citizens caused by individuals who litter.

The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.

b)  the application of the Ordinance on this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
c)  such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved;

In exercising the above powers, the Board of Appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this act: reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination; and, to that end, shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.
