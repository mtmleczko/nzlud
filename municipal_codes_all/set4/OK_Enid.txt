   The holder of any elective office may be removed at any time by the electors
qualified to vote for a successor of such incumbent. The procedure to effect
the removal of an incumbent of an elective office shall be as follows: A
petition signed by electors entitled to vote for a successor to the incumbent
sought to be removed, equal in number to at least thirty (30) per centum of the
vote of those that voted in the particular ward for commissioners if the recall
is for a commissioner or thirty (30) per centum of all those who voted for the
office of the Mayor if the recall is for the Mayor at the last preceding
general municipal election, demanding an election of a successor of the person
sought to be removed shall be filed with the City Clerk, which petition shall
contain a general statement of the grounds and charges for which the removal is
sought. The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to one paper,
but each signer shall add to his signature his place of residence, giving the
street and number. One of the signers of each such paper shall make oath before
an officer competent to administer oaths that the statements therein made are
true as he believes, and that each signature to the paper appended is the
genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Within ten (10)
days from the date of filing such petition the City Clerk shall examine and
from the voters' register ascertain whether or not said petition is signed by
the requisite number of qualified electors, and, if necessary, the Council
shall allow him extra help for that purpose; and he shall attach to said
petition his certificate, showing the result of said examination. If by the
Clerk's certificate the petition is shown to be insufficient, it may be amended
within ten (10) days from the date of said certificate. The Clerk shall, within
ten (10) days after such amendment, make like examination of the amended
petition, and if his certificate shall show the same to be insufficient, it
shall be returned to the person filing the same without prejudice, however, to
the filing of a new petition to the same effect. If the petition shall be
deemed to be sufficient, the Clerk shall submit the same to the Mayor and
Commissioners without delay. If the petition shall be found to be sufficient,
the Council shall order and fix a date for holding the said election, not less
than thirty (30) days nor more than forty (40) days from the date of the
Clerk's certificate to the Mayor and Commissioners that a sufficient petition
is filed.
   The Mayor and Commissioners shall make, or cause to be made, publication of
notice and all arrangements for holding such election, and the same shall be
conducted, returned and the result thereof declared, in all respects as are
other city elections. The successor of an officer so removed shall hold office
during the unexpired term of his predecessor. Any person sought to be removed
may be a candidate to succeed himself, and unless he requests otherwise in
writing, the Clerk shall place his name on the official ballot without
nomination. In any such removal election, the candidate receiving the highest
number of votes shall be declared elected. At such election if some other
person than the incumbent receives the highest number of votes the incumbent
shall thereupon be deemed removed from the office upon qualification of his
successor. In case the party who receives the highest number of votes shall
fail to qualify, within ten (10) days after receiving notification of election,
the office shall be deemed vacant. If the incumbent receives the highest number
of votes, he shall continue in office. The same method of removal shall be
cumulative and additional to the methods heretofore provided by law.
   No recall petition shall be filed against any officer until he has actually
held his office for at least six (6) months.

arrested person;
      3.   The arrested person signs a written promise to appear as provided

proof thereof to such defendant, if the defendant personally appears, or shall
mail such proof by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the defendant at the
address noted on the citation or at such other address as is furnished by the
defendant. Additionally, the court or court clerk shall notify the home
jurisdiction of the defendant as listed on the citation, if such jurisdiction
is a member of the nonresident violator compact, and shall in all cases notify

handicap; or

1-13-3: EXCLUSIVE RECOGNITION:
   A.   A labor organization seeking exclusive recognition shall submit to the
employer a roster of its officers and representatives, a copy of its charter
and constitution and bylaws.
   B.   The mayor and board of commissioners shall accord exclusive recognition
to a labor organization when the organization has been selected, in a secret
ballot election, by a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining
unit as their representative. When a labor organization has been accorded
exclusive recognition, it is the exclusive representative of employees in the
unit and is entitled to act for and to negotiate agreements covering all
employees in the unit. It is responsible for representing the interests of all
employees in the unit without discrimination and without regard to labor
organization membership.
   C.   Bargaining units shall ensure a clear and identifiable community of
interest among the employees concerned, promote effective dealings between the
labor organization and the employer, and promote the efficiency of city
operations. Therefore, there shall be established only one bargaining unit as a
result of secret ballot election. No bargaining unit shall be established if it
includes:
      1.   Police officers or firefighters;
      2.   Any management official or management/confidential employee,
supervisor or confidential employee;
      3.   An employee engaged in administering this chapter; or
      4.   A temporary or seasonal employee hired for a time certain of less
than six (6) months during a fiscal year.
   D.   All elections shall be conducted by secret ballot. Each employee not
excluded from the bargaining unit shall be eligible to vote and shall be
provided the opportunity to choose the labor organization he wishes to
represent him from among those on the ballot, or "no union". When no category
on the ballot receives a majority of the valid ballots cast, a runoff election
shall be held between the two (2) categories receiving the largest and second
largest number of votes in the first election. Elections may be held to
determine whether:
      1.   A labor organization should be recognized as the exclusive
representative of the employees;
      2.   A labor organization should replace another labor organization as
the exclusive representative; or
      3.   A labor organization should cease to be the exclusive
representative.
   E.   The employer shall call and hold an election upon receipt of a timely,
written petition signed by no less than thirty percent (30%) of the employees
eligible for membership in the union indicating their desire to be represented
by that particular labor organization or to change or to withdraw recognition.
No labor organization will be permitted to intervene in the election proceeding
and secure a place on the ballot unless it has submitted a timely, written
petition signed by no less than twenty percent (20%) of the employees eligible
for membership in the unit indicating their desire to be represented by that
particular labor organization. The employer may hold an election when he has
evidence supporting a good faith belief that the labor organization no longer
is the choice of employees in the bargaining unit.
   F.   When the employer has received an appropriate petition, the employer
shall post notices to all employees containing information as to the name of
the petition. All interested labor organizations wishing to participate in the
election must seek intervention within the ten (10) day period following the
date of the posting of the notice by submitting a timely, written petition with
the employer and otherwise meeting the requirements of this chapter. As soon as
possible after the close of the period of intervention, the employer shall meet
with representatives of the successful petitions to arrange the details of the
election. Following the meeting, the employer shall post appropriate notices of
election. Between the meeting and the date of the election set by the employer,
all parties to the election may campaign freely. Such notices shall set forth
details and procedures for the election, the eligibility period, the date,
hour, and place of the election and shall contain a sample ballot, which is
clearly marked "sample" on its face. The employer shall provide the voting
booths and ballot boxes.
Each labor organization on the ballot and the employer may be represented by no
more than two (2) observers of its own selection at the polling place. The
observers' function is to see that the election is conducted fairly, the
security of the ballot is maintained, and all eligible voters are given an
opportunity to cast a ballot. At the conclusion of the balloting the ballots
will be counted by the observers and an appropriate tally of ballots will be
issued. Representatives of the labor organizations and the employer shall sign
the tally of ballots indicating that the tally is correct. The signing of the
tally does not constitute a waiver of any rights by any party to file
objections. The city manager shall promptly report the final results of the
election to the mayor and board of commissioners. If a labor organization
receives votes equaling fifty percent (50%) plus one, this organization will be
recognized as their bargaining agent by the mayor and board of commissioners.
Otherwise, no bargaining unit will be recognized.
   G.   There shall be no election to determine whether a labor organization
should become, or continue to be recognized as, exclusive representative of the
employees within twelve (12) months after a prior valid election for those
employees. When an agreement covering these employees has been signed by the
employer and the incumbent exclusive representative, an election petition will
not be timely unless filed with the employer not earlier than October 1 and not
later than October 15.
   H.   Recognition of a labor organization does not preclude an employee,
regardless of whether he or she is in the union, from exercising rights
established by law, or from choosing his or her own representative in the
exercise of such rights. (Ord. 2014-02, 1-7-2014)

the city in situations of emergency.

initial or basic agreement and apply to all supplemental, implementing,
subsidiary, or informal agreements between the employer and the labor
organization. (Ord. 2014-02, 1-7-2014)
1-13-5: COLLECTIVE BARGAINING:

collectively with the employer and to be represented by a bargaining agent in

recognized bargaining agent notifies the employer within one hundred fifty
(150) days before the mayor and board of commissioners must adopt a budget for
the fiscal year. (Ord. 2014-02, 1-7-2014)
1-13-6: MEET AND CONFER:
It shall be the obligation of the employer to meet at reasonable times and
confer in good faith with the labor organization within ten (10) days after
receipt of written notice by the bargaining agent requesting a meeting for
collective bargaining purposes. The obligation shall include the duty to cause
any collective bargaining agreement resulting from negotiations to be reduced
to a written agreement. The employer shall enter into no agreement with a labor
organization without the express, written authorization of the mayor and board
of commissioners. (Ord. 2014-02, 1-7-2014)
1-13-7: ARBITRATION:
In the event that the bargaining agent and the employer are unable within sixty
(60) days from and including the date of the first meeting, to reach an
agreement on a contract, any and all unresolved issues shall be submitted to
arbitration, upon request of either party. (Ord. 2014-02, 1-7-2014)
1-13-8: ARBITRATORS; SELECTION:
Within five (5) days from the date of the request for arbitration referred to
in section
1-13-7 of this chapter, the bargaining agent and the employer shall each select
and name one arbitrator and shall immediately thereafter notify each other in
writing of the name and address of the person so selected. The two (2)
arbitrators so selected and named shall, within five (5) days from and after
the expiration of the five (5) day period hereinabove mentioned, agree upon and
select a third arbitrator. If, on the expiration of the period allowed
therefor, the arbitrators are unable to agree upon the selection of a third
arbitrator, the bargaining agent and the corporate authorities shall request
the federal mediation and conciliation service to provide a list of seven (7)
arbitrators. Within five (5) days after receipt of the list of arbitrators from
the federal mediation and conciliation service, the two (2) arbitrators already
selected shall alternately strike the name of one arbitrator from the list of

hearing to be held within ten (10) days after the date of the appointment of
the chair and shall, acting through its chair, give at least seven (7) days'
notice in writing to each of the other two (2) arbitrators, the bargaining
agent and the employer of the time and place of such hearing.
      2.   At least seven (7) days before the date of the hearing the employer
and the bargaining agent shall submit to each other and to the arbitration
board members a written arbitration statement listing all contract terms which
the parties have resolved and all contract issues which are unresolved. Each
arbitration statement shall also include a final offer on each unresolved
issue. The terms and offers contained in the arbitration statements shall be
known collectively as each party's last best offer.
      3.   The hearing shall be informal and the rules of evidence prevailing
in judicial proceedings shall not be binding. Any and all documentary evidence
and other data deemed relevant by the arbitrators may be received in evidence.
The arbitrators shall have the power to administer oaths and to require by
subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses, the production of books,
records, and other evidence relative or pertinent to the issues presented to
them for determination. A hearing shall be concluded within twenty (20) days
from the time of commencement.
      4.   Within seven (7) days after the conclusion of the hearing, a
majority of the arbitration board members shall select one of the two (2) last
best offers as the contract of the parties. The criteria to be used by the
board in determining which offer to select shall be limited to subsections
1-13-10A1 through A5 of this chapter. The arbitration board may not modify, add
to or delete from the last best offer of either party. Written notice of the
selection decision shall be mailed or delivered to the bargaining agent and the
employer.
   B.   If the employer's last best offer is not selected by the arbitration
board, that party may submit the offers which the parties submitted to the
arbitration board to the voters of the city of Enid, for their selection by
requesting a special election for that purpose. The request for an election
must be filed with the clerk of the municipality within twenty (20) days of the
date of the written decision of the arbitration board. Written notice of the
filing of the request shall be given to the bargaining agent. If a request for
an election is not filed in a timely manner, the board's selection decision

this section, the clerk shall notify the mayor and board of commissioners of
the request. Within twenty (20) days of such notification the municipal
authorities shall call for a special election. The election shall be governed
by the state laws on special municipal elections. Only residents of the
municipality shall be eligible to vote in said election. The ballot shall
inform the voters that they must choose either the last best offer of the
bargaining agent or the last best offer of the employer. The last best offer
receiving a majority of the votes shall become the agreement of the parties.
   D.   Concerning issues relating to money, such ballot shall clearly state
the total dollar amount of the offer from the employer and the total dollar
amount of the offer from the bargaining agent. Such ballot shall also disclose
the total percentage of increase or decrease both offers have over or under the
last contract of the two (2) parties. This calculation shall include all
monetary issues.
   E.   Agreements which are reached as a result of selection by the
arbitration board or by election shall be effective on the first day of the
fiscal year involved regardless of the date of the final selection. (Ord. 2014-
02, 1-7-2014)
1-13-10: FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED:
   A.   The arbitrators shall conduct the hearings and render their decision

disputes between the employees and the employer. The factors, among others, to
be given weight by the arbitrators in arriving at a decision shall include:

benefits of the employees in question with the prevailing wage rates of skilled
employees of the building trades and industry in the local operating area

benefits of the employees in question with wage rates maintained for the same
or similar work of employees exhibiting like or similar skills under the same

benefits of the employees in question with wage rates of similar employees in
cities, towns, or other political subdivisions of comparable size and economic
status within the state of Oklahoma and bordering states. "Comparable size"
shall be defined as no less and no more than ten percent (10%) difference in
population based on the last census. "Comparable economic status" shall be
defined as cities which own and operate only a water utility (no other
utilities) and which sales tax revenue for the previous year was no less and no
more than ten percent (10%) different from the city of Enid's sales tax
revenue.
      4.   Interest and welfare of the public and revenues available to the
municipality; or
      5.   Comparison of peculiarities of employment in regard to other trades
or professions, including specifically:

         b.   Physical qualifications,
         c.   Educational qualifications,
         d.   Mental qualifications, and

Fees and necessary expenses of the arbitrator selected by the bargaining agent
and the arbitrator selected by the employer shall be borne by the bargaining
agent and the employer respectively. The reasonable fees and necessary expenses
of the third arbitrator shall be borne equally by the bargaining agent and

1-13-12: AGREEMENTS; CONTENTS:
Any agreement actually negotiated between the bargaining agent and the employer
either before or within thirty (30) days after arbitration shall constitute the
collective bargaining contract governing the employees for the period stated
therein. Any collective bargaining agreement negotiated under the terms and
provisions of this chapter shall specifically provide that the employees who
are subject to its terms shall have no right to engage in any work stoppage,
slowdown, or strike, the consideration for such provision being the right to a
resolution of disputed questions. Every such agreement shall contain a clause
establishing arbitration procedures for the immediate and speedy resolution and
determination of any dispute, which may arise involving the interpretation of
any of the provisions of such agreement. (Ord. 2014-02, 1-7-2014)

associated with known patterns of fraud, such as a customer failing to make the
first payment or makes the first payment but fails to make subsequent payments.
      3.   An account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. (For example, there is a
nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments, or a material
change in consumption of services.)

although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer's account.

1-14-8: PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF IDENTITY THEFT:
   A.   Existing Accounts: In the event that a city employee responsible for or
involved in restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a
covered account becomes aware of one or more red flags with respect to existing
covered accounts, such employee shall use discretion to determine whether such
red flag or combination of red flags suggest a threat of identity theft. If
such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is
likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to
the finance director. If such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or
that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee
shall convey this information to the finance director, who may determine that
no further action is necessary. If the finance director determines that further
action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following
responses, as determined to be appropriate by the finance director:
      1.   Contact the customer;
      2.   If after contacting the customer, it is apparent that someone other
than the customer has accessed the customer's covered account, the following
changes to the account should occur:
         a.   Change any account numbers, passwords, security codes or other
security devices that permit access to an account; or
         b.   Close the account;
      3.   Cease attempts to collect additional charges from the customers, and
decline to sell the customer's account to a debt collector in the event that
the customer's account has been accessed without authorization and such access
has caused additional charges to accrue;
      4.   In the event that a customer's account has been sold to a debt
collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or probability of identity
theft relating to such account, notify the debt collector within seventy two
(72) hours of the discovery of a probable identity theft related to a customer
account;
      5.   Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the
customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to
accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or
      6.   Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft.
   B.   New Accounts: In the event that a city employee responsible for or
involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of one or more red
flags with respect to an application for a new account, such employee shall use
discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags
suggests a threat of identity theft. If such employee determines that identity
theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall
immediately report such red flags to the finance director. If such employee
deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available
to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the
finance director, who may determine that no further action is necessary. If the
finance director determines that further action is necessary, a city employee
shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be
appropriate by the finance director:
      1.   Request additional identifying information from the applicant;
      2.   Deny the application for the new account;
      3.   Notify law enforcement of possible identity theft; or
      4.   Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

discontinued types of covered accounts. Any recommended material changes to the
program shall be submitted to the city council for consideration.
   B.   The finance director will review the program in November 2009, and
prepare a report for the city manager and the city council in May 2010. The
report will address material matters related to the program and evaluate issues
such as:
      1.   The effectiveness of its policies and procedures in addressing the
risk of identity theft in connection with the covered accounts;
      2.   Service provider arrangements;
      3.   Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's
response; and
      4.   Recommendations for material changes to the program.
Thereafter, the finance director shall report at least annually to the city
manager on compliance with the identity theft prevention program.
   C.   The finance director is responsible for providing training to all
employees responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account,
restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered
account with respect to the implantation and requirements of the identity theft
prevention program. The finance director shall determine the amount and
substance of training necessary. (Ord. 2009-12, 4-21-2009)
1-14-10: AMENDMENTS TO PROGRAM:
Based upon the annual reviews of the program, recommendations and amendments to
the program should be considered by the city council whenever necessary. The
council should consider updating this chapter to reflect changes in risks to
customers or to the safety of the city and its covered accounts from identity
theft. It shall consider the following factors and exercise its discretion in
amending the program:

In the event that the city engages a service provider to perform an activity in
connection with one or more covered accounts the finance director shall
exercise discretion in reviewing such arrangements in order to ensure that the
service provider's activities are conducted in accordance with policies and
procedures that are designated to detect any red flags that may arise in the
performance of the service provider's activities and that appropriate steps are
in place to prevent or mitigate identity theft. This should be covered in the
contract between the service provider and the city. (Ord. 2009-12, 4-21-2009)
1-14-12: TREATMENT OF ADDRESS DISCREPANCIES:
   A.   Customer Identity: Pursuant to 16 CFR section 681.1, the city must
establish a process for determining the identity of a customer when there is a
discrepancy between the address provided and the one listed on the customer
credit report.
   B.   Activities To Be Performed: In the event that the city receives a
notice of address discrepancy, the city employee responsible for verifying a
consumer's address for the purpose of providing the municipal service or
account sought by the consumer shall perform one or more of the following
activities, as determined to be appropriate by such employee:
      1.   Compare the information in the consumer report with:
         a.   Information the city obtains to verify a consumer's identity in
accordance with the requirements of the customer information program rules
pursuant to 31 USC section 531.8(l);
         b.   Information the city maintains in its own records, such as
applications for service, change of address notices, other customer account
records or tax records; or
         c.   Information the city obtains from third party sources that are
deemed reliable by the relevant city employee; or
      2.   Verify the information in the consumer report with the consumer.
   C.   Address Confirmation; Reporting To Consumer Reporting Agency: In the
event that the city reasonably confirms that an address provided by a consumer
to the city is adequate, the city is required to provide such address to the
consumer reporting agency from which the city received a notice of address
discrepancy with respect to such consumer. This information is required to be
provided to the consumer reporting agency when:
      1.   The city is able to form a reasonable belief that the consumer
report relates to the consumer about whom the city requested the report;
      2.   The city establishes a continuing relationship with the consumer;
and
      3.   The city regularly and in the ordinary course of business provides
information to the consumer reporting agency from which it received the notice
of address discrepancy.
Such information shall be provided to the consumer reporting agency as part of
the information regularly provided by the city to such agency for the reporting
period in which the city establishes a relationship with the customer.
   D.   Methods Of Confirming Consumer Addresses: The city employee charged
with confirming consumer addresses may confirm the accuracy of an address
through one or more of the following methods:
      1.   Verify the address with the consumer;
      2.   Review the city's records to verify the consumer's address;
      3.   Verify the address through third party sources; or
      4.   Use other reasonable processes. (Ord. 2009-12, 4-21-2009)

1-15-1: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
The City of Enid recognizes that special events in the City help create a
community that is engaged with both its civic and private leaders. The City
understands that in order to better serve the community, a streamlined and
efficient application and permit process is necessary to allocate the proper
resources for each event. These resources allocated to the health, safety,
welfare, and environment of the community may become strained and affect the
community if not coordinated between the operators of the special event and the
City. The City wishes to prevent situations which exceed the City's capacity to
provide adequately for security, public safety, health, sanitation, parking,
water, medical care, lodging and waste disposal. Further, the City desires to
protect sensitive environmental areas and prevent noise, congestion, and other
nuisances which interfere with the inhabitants' peaceful enjoyment of their
homes, businesses, and property. It is the intent of this chapter to regulate
special events and improve quality of life in the community by mitigating any
adverse effects special events may cause. (Ord. 2016-15, 7-7-2016)

submit an application to the City of Enid on a form prescribed by the Parks and
Recreation Department. The application must be submitted no less than thirty
(30) days prior to the proposed date of the event. However, the City of Enid
recognizes some small, informal events may materialize in a short period and
are not subject to the thirty (30) day deadline unless they are of a nature,
size and logistical challenge as is intended by this chapter. Exceptions to
this deadline will be reviewed on a case by case basis, but the spirit and
intent of this chapter shall be observed by all applicants.
   B.   Fees: The operator must submit the necessary fees as determined by the
city of Enid after processing and approval of the permit application.
Determination of applicable fees depends on the size and the type of the event,
as well as other services needed for the event. These fees may include, but are
not limited to: a beer license fee, a traffic control fee, a park rental fee, a
cleaning fee, and an electrical setup/service fee, as applicable. The city of
Enid intends to ensure the cost of such events is held to a minimum and will
review each application for accommodation of fees.
   C.   Unique Circumstances: Recognizing that many special events are unique
and present their own special circumstances, the city manager is authorized to
promulgate regulations to meet the intent of this chapter and to waive or
modify requirements of this chapter or regulations to meet unique circumstances
of a particular special event.
   D.   Application: The operator shall provide the following supporting
documents for the application:
      1.   A completed application with all applicable information attached to
the documentation for review;
      2.   If determined essential to the specific event, a map of the event
area showing the location of all street closures, fire lanes, water supplies,
points of illumination, tents, trash containers, first aid stations,

caused by the public sanitary sewer system due to continual and persistent
sanitary sewer backups into such customer's private property, not covered by
any negligence on the part of the customer, after the application by the city
and/or authority of all reasonable operational and maintenance procedures for
resolving the condition, may file an application with the city clerk for
financial assistance. Such application shall contain such information as
required by the city manager and shall contain a verification clause. The city
engineer or his designee shall review such application to determine whether the
sanitary sewer backup event falls within the purview of this program. The city
engineer's determination shall be provided in writing to the customer. In the
event that the city engineer determines that the backup event is covered under
this program as provided hereinabove, then the customer shall provide the
receipts for the cost of the repairs, replacements or installations
necessitated due to the sewer backup, including the receipts for the
installation of the backflow prevention system, and which receipts shall
further show that such work has been performed or material or equipment
replaced or installed and paid for by the customer.
         b.   All applications must be filed within ninety (90) days after the
date the customer is notified that the city's insurance will not be paying said
claim. The maximum amount paid on any application based on a single occurrence
shall be five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Such funds shall be allocated on a
first come, first serve basis, and no additional city or authority funds shall
be used to make reimbursement under this program and subaccount. All claims for
damages must be reasonable. Reimbursement shall not exceed fifty percent (50%)
of the actual, reasonable damages incurred, including the actual cost of
installation of a backflow prevention system as approved by the city engineer,
which system shall include a manual shutoff valve and/or sump pump.
         c.   No reimbursement shall be made unless the customer: 1) first
files a claim with the city's insurance and is turned down by the insurance
carrier; and 2) installs the backflow prevention system or systems as required
to provide protection for all buildings subject to damage by the public
sanitary sewer system located at or adjacent to the damaged home, building or
structure; and 3) executes a contract with the city permitting the right, but
not the duty or obligation, to inspect such backflow prevention system; and 4)
signs a release and waiver releasing the city and all its employees and
officers from any and all liability based on the sewer backflow occurrence and
any and all damage that may be occasioned in the future by the backflow
prevention system. No home, building or structure fitted with a backflow
prevention system with any funds from this subaccount shall be eligible for
future funding from the subaccount. Any loss claim paid to customer by any
insurance policy due to the sewer backup event shall be deducted from the total
amount sought by customer for reimbursement.
         d.   In the event that the city is deemed to be legally liable for the
damage due to the backflow of sewage into any home, building or structure, any
such claim or judgment shall be paid in accordance with the city's insurance,
and not in accordance with this section.
         e.   The city engineer or his designee shall review all applications
and implement the terms of this section to the extent of available funding.
         f.   Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to place any
duty or obligation on the city or authority to pay such funds to any person,

signals exhibiting different colored lights or colored lighted arrows
successively one at a time, or in combination, only the colors green, red and
yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word
legend, and said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and
pedestrians as follows:
      1.   Green Indication:
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal, except when
prohibited under subsection
6-1-12B of this title, may proceed straight through or turn right or left
unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn, but vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other
vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or on adjacent
crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
         b.   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
         c.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as
provided in subsection
6-3-7A of this chapter, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the

signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in
subsection
6-3-7A of this chapter, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to
cross the roadway before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall
then start to cross the roadway.
      3.   Steady Red Indication:
         a.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall
stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown,
except as provided in subsection A3b of this section.
         b.   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular
traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to
turn right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street after
stopping as required by subsection A3a of this section. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the
provisions of this section shall be applicable, except as to those provisions
which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made
at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made,

      2.   Wait Or Don't Walk: No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway
in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed
his crossing on the walk sign shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island
while the wait signal is showing.
   B.   School Crossing Signals 2 : Whenever a pedestrian actuated school
crossing signal is provided, it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic
and pedestrians in accordance with sections

   A.   Residential Sidewalk Repair Partnership Program: Eligible residential
property owners that desire to install or improve the sidewalks located in the
right of way may apply to the city for partnership funds to be used to make
repairs to the sidewalks.
      1.   To qualify, the property must be located within the city limits and
have or have been developed with sidewalks or the properties on either side of
the subject property have or have been developed with sidewalks. The sidewalk
must be in need of repair or reconstruction due to its condition or because it
does not comply with current sidewalk standards.
      2.   To be accepted into the program, the property owner must be able to
provide fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the repair or reconstruction or be
willing to have fifty percent (50%) of the cost be assessed against the
property to be paid back as provided for by state law as a sidewalk assessment
or as a lien.
      3.   Acceptance is contingent on the availability of matching funds and
priority will be given to applications on the basis of the condition of the
sidewalk, the need, and the scope of the project. Work that will result in a
general improvement to pedestrian access rather than provide only a localized
benefit will be given priority. Landowners are encouraged to consider making an
area wide application where appropriate.
      4.   If a property is accepted into the program, an agreement will be
drawn up between the property owner or owners and the city. If the
circumstances warrant, the city may provide more than a fifty percent (50%)
match if the scope of the project involves more than repair or is coupled with
additional municipal objectives.

owners that desire to install or improve sidewalks in the right of way may
apply to the city for partnership funds to be used to install or improve the
sidewalks.
      1.   To qualify, the property must be the location of an existing
business within city limits which was not required, when developed, to include
sidewalks.
      2.   To be accepted into the program, the property owner must be able to
provide fifty percent (50%) of the cost for the installation or be willing to
have fifty percent (50%) of the cost be assessed against the property to be
paid back as provided for by state law as a sidewalk assessment or as a lien.
      3.   Acceptance is contingent on the availability of matching funds and
priority will be given to applications on the basis of what type of street the
property abuts, the need and the scope of the project. Landowners are
encouraged to consider making an area wide application where appropriate.
      4.   If a property is accepted into the program, an agreement will be
drawn up between the property owner or owners and the city. If the
circumstances warrant, the city may provide more than a fifty percent (50%)
match if the scope of the project is coupled with additional municipal
objectives.
   C.   Ineligibility For Program: A property for which a sidewalk development
fee has previously been paid in lieu of construction of a sidewalk shall be
ineligible for the sidewalk partnership program. (Ord. 2016-03, 2-2-2016)

residential districts and local streets in commercial districts. Type I
pavement shall be a six inch (6") slab of Portland cement concrete on one-half
inch (1/2") sand cushion and six inch (6") compacted subgrade of suitable
material or six inch (6") compacted stabilized base as directed by the city
engineer. The stabilized base or subgrade shall extend ten inches (10") beyond

7-8-9: PERMIT AND VARIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Future Uses:
      1.   Except as specifically provided in subsections A1a, A1b, and A1c of
this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure
shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any
zone created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted.
Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit
is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether
the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be
granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter
shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with
subsection D of this section.
         a.   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
         b.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a
horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred feet (4,200')
from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height above the
ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such approach zones.
         c.   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones
beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall be required for
any tree or structure less than seventy five feet (75') of vertical height
above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land
contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such transition zones.
      2.   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter, except as set forth in subsection
7-8-6G of this chapter.
   B.   Existing Uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto, or than it is
when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all
applications for such a permit shall be granted.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned Or Destroyed: Whenever the joint airport
zoning board determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than eighty percent (80%) torn down, physically deteriorated,
or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree
to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning
regulations.
   D.   Variances:
      1.   Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the board of
adjustment for a variance. The application for a variance from such regulations
shall be accompanied by a determination from the federal aviation
administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard
to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with
the spirit of this chapter.
      2.   Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of
this chapter may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the
application has been furnished to the joint airport zoning board for advice as
to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the joint airport zoning board
does not respond to the application within thirty (30) days after receipt, the
board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
   E.   Obstructions; Marking And Lighting: Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain,
at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed
proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require
the owner to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate, and
maintain the necessary markings and lights. (Ord. 2002-05, 3-12-2002)

the joint airport zoning board, cause imminent peril to life or property. In
such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the board of
adjustment on notice to the administering agency and the joint airport zoning
board, and on due cause shown.
   D.   Action In Timely Manner: The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable
time for hearing appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any
party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.

responsible and save the licensee harmless for all claims and demands for
damages to persons or property arising out of the use by the city of the cable
system.
   E.   Time Limit For Upgrade And Installations: The upgrade and installations
required under this section shall be completed on or before December 31, 1996.
The city shall grant reasonable extensions of time to complete construction in
particular areas of the city if, prior to the scheduled time for completion,
the licensee shows that, notwithstanding its due diligence, it has been unable
to extend service to a specified area because the acts or omissions of a third
party (not including the licensee's subcontractors or agents) have caused a
delay in construction beyond delays reasonably expected during the course of a
rebuild or upgrade, and the licensee proposes a reasonable alternative deadline
for extension of service to that area. (1994 Code § 9-9)
7-9B-2: CABLE SYSTEM DESIGN REVIEW PROCESS:
   A.   Elements Of Plan: At least thirty (30) days prior to the date that
construction of any required upgrade is scheduled to commence, the licensee
shall make available a detailed cable system design and construction plan,
available for review by the city at the local office of the licensee, which
shall include at least the following elements:
      1.   Design type, trunk and feeder design, number and location of hubs or
nodes.
      2.   Distribution system cable, fiber, equipment to be used.
      3.   Plans for standby power at headend.
      4.   Longer amplifier cascade in system (number of amplifiers, number of
miles, type of cable/fiber).
      5.   Design maps and tree trunk maps for the cable system.
   B.   Design Shown On Maps: The system design will be shown on maps of
industry standard scale using standard symbology, and shall depict all
electronic and physical features of the cable system. (1994 Code § 9-10)

The licensee shall perform all tests necessary to demonstrate compliance with
the requirements of 47 CFR 76 subpart K of the FCC rules and regulations. All
tests shall be conducted in accordance with most current publications of
Tektronix, "No Loose Ends", and/or NCTA's "Recommended Practices for
Measurements on Cable Systems". The licensee shall perform at least the
following tests:
   A.   Acceptance Tests:
      1.   The licensee shall perform acceptance tests on the entire system at
the conclusion of the upgrade to demonstrate compliance with 47 CFR 76 subpart
K of the FCC rules and regulations.
      2.   The city has the option of witnessing the tests. The test results
shall be submitted to the city for review. The licensee shall have the
obligation, without further notice from the city, to take corrective action if
any segment is not operating or performing within 47 CFR 76 subpart K of the
FCC rules and regulations.
   B.   Continuing Tests: The licensee and the city will jointly select test
points at various points of the system. The quantity of these test points will
be mutually agreed upon based on what best represents the architecture of the
cable system. The licensee shall perform proof of performance tests at these
locations annually in conjunction with 47 CFR 76 subpart K through the term of
the license, and at other points mutually agreed upon where cable system user
complaints indicate tests are warranted or as required to test all major trunk
lines. The city shall have the option of witnessing the tests. A written report
of the test results shall be filed with city within thirty (30) days of the
test. If a location fails to meet performance specifications as outlined in 47
CFR 76 subpart K, the licensee, without requirement of additional notice or
request from the city, shall take corrective action, retest the locations and
advise the city of the action taken and results achieved. (1994 Code § 9-11)
7-9B-4: INSPECTIONS DURING CONSTRUCTION:
The city may conduct inspections of construction areas and subscriber
installations, including to assure compliance with the applicable laws, codes,
and requirements of this license. The licensee shall be notified of any
violations found during the course of inspections. The licensee must bring
violations into compliance within thirty (30) days of the date it receives
notice, and submit a report to the city describing the steps taken to bring
itself into compliance. Inspection does not relieve the licensee of its
obligation to build in compliance with all provisions of this chapter. (1994
Code § 9-12)
7-9B-5: OTHER CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES:
The licensee:
   A.   Shall follow a system design and construction plan consistent with its
obligations under this license, use the equipment specified (or substitute
equipment of equivalent or better quality) in such distribution system design
plan and construction plan (except insofar as those plans, if carried out,

consistent with all ordinary care and all applicable laws, ordinances,
construction standards, and FCC technical standards. Upon request, the licensee
shall provide the city a report of the results of any FCC required proof or
performance test conducted by the licensee.
      2.   Furnish the best possible signals available under the circumstances
existing at the time, without causing cross modulation in the cable or
interfering with other electrical or electronic systems, and shall provide
quality reception so that both sound and picture are produced free from visible
and audible distortion and ghost images on standard television receivers in
good repair.
      3.   Except where there exists an emergency situation necessitating a
more expedited procedure, the licensee may interrupt service, for the purpose
of repairing or upgrading the cable system, only during the periods of minimum
use, and only after twenty four (24) hours' minimum notice to its subscribers.
      4.   Maintain equipment capable of providing standby battery power for
trunk amplifiers for a minimum period of three (3) hours.
      5.   As a part of the cable system rebuild, provide capacity for
interactive services which may be added to the cable system as such services
become technically and economically feasible.
      6.   Under normal operating conditions, the following standard shall be
met no less than ninety five percent (95%) of the time on an annual basis:
Except when beyond the control of the licensee, the licensee shall respond to
cable service interruptions promptly and in no event later than twenty four
(24) hours.
      7.   Establish procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving
subscriber complaints, which procedure shall be subject to the approval of the

      8.   Notify the city in writing of any unresolved complaints from
subscribers. The licensee shall promptly investigate any complaints received
from subscribers and take such action as is necessary to provide cable service
to subscribers and to operate the system as required by this chapter. (1994
Code § 9-14)
7-9B-7: CABLE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE:
The city may regulate technical standards for the cable system to the fullest
extent permitted by federal law and regulations, or as same may be hereinafter
amended. Initially, the cable system shall be constructed so as to meet or
exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 CFR section 76.601 et seq. ("FCC
Rules"), as amended, and shall be operated and maintained to satisfy those
standards. (1994 Code § 9-15)
7-9B-8: CABLE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION, EXTENSION, AREA TO SERVE:
   A.   Extend System Upon Request Of Potential Subscribers: The licensee shall
timely construct the cable system as provided by this chapter, and whenever it
shall receive a request for service from at least five (5) subscribers within
one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) cable feet of its trunk cable, extend
its cable system to said subscribers at no cost to the subscribers for cable
system extension other than the usual connection fees for all subscribers;
provided, that such extension is technically and physically feasible. The one
thousand three hundred twenty feet (1,320') shall be measured in extension
length of licensee's cable required for service located within the public
easement or street and shall not include length of necessary service drop to
subscriber's home or premises. The number of dwellings per street mile shall
also be included in the number necessary to determine whether the extension
complies with this section.
   B.   Refusal Of Service: No person shall be arbitrarily refused cable
service unless the prospective subscriber is more than one hundred fifty feet
(150') from distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers, or
there is a density of less than ten (10) subscribers for one thousand three
hundred twenty feet (1,320') of cable system.
   C.   Construction Of System For Future Service: If technologically and
financially feasible, a licensee shall have constructed its system sufficient
to make its cable service available to substantially all of the residential,
commercial and public buildings within the city, before offering cable services
requiring the use of portions of its CATV system to buildings and structures
located in unincorporated areas outside the city's boundaries.
   D.   Application To Territorial Limits: The license shall apply to the
territorial limits of the city as it now exists or may hereafter be determined.
   E.   Capital Contribution In Aid Of Construction: For areas outside the
distance as provided in subsection A of this section, and where there is a
density of less than five (5) potential subscribers per one thousand three
hundred twenty (1,320) cable bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution
cable, the cable system shall be extended on the basis of a capital
contribution in aid of construction, including actual cost of material and
labor. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid
of construction to be borne by the licensee and subscribers in the area in
which cable service is expanded, the licensee will contribute an amount equal
to the construction and other costs per quarter mile, multiplied by the length
of the extension in quarter miles, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator
equals the actual number of potential subscribers per one thousand three
hundred twenty (1,320) cable bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution
cable, and whose denominator equals 5. Persons requesting service will bear the
remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The licensee
may require that the estimated payment of the subscriber's share of the capital
contribution in aid of construction be paid in advance. Any excess amounts
collected in advance must be returned to the subscriber.
   F.   New Subdivisions: In addition, the licensee shall extend its cable
system to any new subdivision; provided, however, the licensee shall extend at
the same time as the gas and electric utilities extend.
   G.   Time Limit For Extending Service: Subject to the provisions in this
section, the licensee must extend cable service to any person requesting it
within seven (7) business days of the request where cable service can be
provided by activating or installing a standard drop. Upon completion of the
system upgrade, cable service must be extended to any person requesting it
within five (5) business days of the request where cable service can be
provided by activating or installing a standard drop. Cable service must be
extended within ten (10) business days of the request for a nonstandard
installation. Where an extension of the distribution system is required,
service must be extended within ninety (90) days of the request for an
extension of one-half (1/2) mile or less or, in other cases, within six (6)
months; provided, however, such time limits shall be extended for a sufficient
period of time necessary to obtain any required permits or permission from
third parties.
   H.   Public And Governmental Buildings:
      1.   The licensee shall, within the city, provide a single installation
of its nonpremium cable service at each public building containing offices of
the city government; each public library, fire and police station, public
schools (including the board of education administration building), Zollars
Library, Gantz Center, the administration building of Phillips University, and
the Enid higher education facility.
      2.   Such installation shall be made at such reasonable locations as
shall be requested by the respective units of government or institutions, at
the sole cost and expense of the licensee. Additional installments or
relocation of installations made pursuant to this chapter shall be performed
and charged by the licensee at actual cost. No monthly service charges shall be
made for distribution of the licensee's nonpremium cable service within the
buildings enumerated in this section. (1994 Code § 9-16)

third channel (or channels) will revert back to the licensee's use until such
time as the remaining channels are programmed with video or text at least four
(4) hours per day, five (5) of seven (7) days a week for three (3) consecutive
months, at which point the channel or channels will be reactivated on request.
The channels reactivated shall be in addition to and not displace, the then
existing services.
   B.   No Charge: The PEG channels shall be available at no charge to users.
   C.   Liability For Obscenity, Defamation, Or Invasion Of Privacy On Access
Channels: Liability for obscenity, defamation, or invasion of privacy on any
access channels shall rest with the person or group of persons utilizing the
access channels.
   D.   Other Programming: When the PEG use channels are not being used to
carry programming provided by other access users, the city or its designee, at
their sole cost and expense, shall have the right to backup PEG programming
with other programming, consistent with promoting public, educational and
governmental use of the channels. This subsection shall not limit the
licensee's rights under 47 USC section 531(d). (1994 Code § 9-17)

royalty has not been compensated for through a rate increase or by other means.
   C.   Periodic Community Surveys: Upon request by the city, the licensee
shall develop and conduct community surveys at least three (3) months prior to
each successive periodic review as provided for in section
7-9C-10 of this chapter, and within six (6) months following the completion of
the upgrade as provided for in section
7-9B-1 of this article, to determine the cable related needs and interests of
the subscribers. The licensee shall bear the costs of such surveys. The
licensee shall commission the use of a professional independent third party to
conduct such survey.
   D.   Access Channel Reserved: The commander's access channel (channel 43)
will be reserved. The channel is to be set aside for government use during
periods of actual government use. In no event is this channel to be viewable by
nongovernment subscribers during periods of government use and should not be
broadcast off base to nonair force subscribers. (1994 Code § 9-18)
7-9B-11: TECHNOLOGY LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
A licensee shall build the latest state of the art cable television system as
is available in similarly sized cities in the state and upgrade its facilities,
equipment and services so that its cable system is as advanced as the current
state of technology in Oklahoma will allow. Provided however, at no time shall
such licensee be required to upgrade its facilities if it demonstrates that
such upgrading would not be financially or technologically feasible or in the
best interest of the city or its subscribers; this limiting condition shall not
apply to the initial rebuild as provided in section
7-9B-1 of this article. (1994 Code § 9-19)
7-9B-12: LICENSEE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROGRAM CONTENT:
   A.   Authority Of City: During the term of this license, the city may not
prohibit the licensee from providing any program or class of programs over the

anniversary of December 31, 1996, and every five (5) years thereafter, the city
may commence a review of the cable system to determine the technological and

community needs and interests, including channel capacity and customer service,
and reviewing the licensee's performance during the proceeding five (5) year
period; to review customer service standards; to review PEG use channel

review provided for in this section, the licensee and the city shall meet,

the licensee of its obligation to comply with the license. The subscriber rates
and charges imposed by the licensee shall not be increased or affected, either
directly or indirectly, by reason of any payment licensee may be required to
make pursuant to this section. (1994 Code § 9-34)

   A.   For any wilful violation of any material provision of the license or
this chapter;
   B.   If the licensee is adjudicated bankrupt, or if any other license
required under state or federal law to provide cable service in the city is
revoked;
   C.   For any attempt to evade any material provision of the license or this
chapter, or practicing any fraud or deceit upon cable system subscribers or the
city. (1994 Code § 9-35)
7-9D-5: PROCEDURES FOR TERMINATION AND FORFEITURE:
   A.   Notice To Licensee: The city shall notify the licensee in writing of
the alleged violation which may warrant termination, under section
7-9D-4 of this article, which notice shall:
      1.   Describe the specific alleged violation(s);
      2.   Direct the licensee to correct or to show cause why the alleged
violation(s) should not be corrected; and
      3.   State the time for response which shall be no less than thirty (30)
days from the date licensee receives such written notice.
   B.   Remedial Action: Within the time designated, the licensee must:
      1.   Cure the violation(s) or, in the event the violation(s) cannot be
completely cured within the time period specified, take reasonable steps to
begin to cure, and submit a written response to the city, identifying the
specific steps taken; or
      2.   Contest the assertion of violation(s), describing all facts relevant
to the claim, supported by affidavits and documents.
   C.   Notice Of Hearing In Case Of Default: If the licensee contests the
city's assertion of violation(s), or fails to completely cure the alleged
default, including paying any damages owed, unless waived, the city shall
schedule a hearing to review the alleged default. The city shall cause to be
served upon such licensee, at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of
such hearing, a written notice of the city's intent to review; specify if
termination is sought as a remedy; and state the time and place of the meeting,
notice of which shall be published at least once, no later than seven (7) days
before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The
city shall hear any person interested therein, and shall specifically provide
the licensee an opportunity to be heard, and shall determine whether or not any
licensee has complied, or submitted a reasonable plan for compliance.
   D.   Determination Of Noncompliance: If the city shall determine that the
licensee is not in compliance or has failed to submit a reasonable plan, then
the city may take any actions it is permitted to take under this license,
chapter or applicable law. Such actions may be taken immediately upon
completion of the hearing contemplated by this section or after such additional
proceedings as the city may specify.
   E.   Conduct Of Hearing; Selection Of Hearing Officer: Notwithstanding the
above, before it can revoke the license, the city must conduct a hearing in
which the licensee and the city shall be afforded a fair opportunity for full
participation, including, as permitted by Oklahoma law, the right to introduce
relevant evidence, to require the production of evidence, to compel the
relevant testimony of officials, agents, employees or consultants of the other,
to compel the testimony of other persons and to question witnesses. The city
and the licensee shall attempt to select jointly a third party to conduct the
hearings described above. If the parties are unable to agree upon a single
hearing officer, each shall select one officer and the two (2) officers so
selected shall select a third officer. The hearing officer(s) shall determine
whether or not the licensee has complied or submitted a reasonable plan for
compliance as required by subsection B of this section.
   F.   Licensee Challenge Of Decision: If the licensee is adversely affected
by a decision of the city, it may file an appropriate action in any court of
competent jurisdiction. For purposes of any action challenging a decision
issued after the hearing required by subsection C of this section, the parties
stipulate that the record of the administrative hearing and the decisions of
the hearing officer(s) and the city shall constitute the entire factual record.
The licensee shall be entitled to such relief as the court deems appropriate:
1) if the licensee demonstrates that the action of the city was not supported
by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the stipulated record; or 2) if
the court finds that the city's actions were not in compliance with the
procedural requirements of this section. (1994 Code § 9-36)
7-9D-6: CONTINUITY OF SERVICE; RIGHT TO PURCHASE:
   A.   Obligation Of Licensee: The licensee has an obligation to provide for
continuous, uninterrupted service to its subscribers, as far as is possible, at
all times.
   B.   Transition Period: Upon termination of this license by passage of time
or otherwise, the licensee and the city agree to cooperate in maintaining
continuity of service to all subscribers in the service area. To this end, upon
the lawful termination of the license, the city may require the licensee to
continue to operate and maintain the cable system after the license is
terminated for a period not to exceed thirty (30) months from the date of the
final adjudication of any dispute holding that the license has been lawfully
terminated. This period is referred to as the "transition period". During the
transition period, the licensee shall be bound by the terms of the license and
this chapter, as if the license remained in effect.
   C.   City Entitled To Injunctive Relief: The city shall be entitled to
injunctive relief:
      1.   If after the passage of ninety six (96) consecutive hours, if
licensee fails to provide cable service over a substantial portion of the
service area, consistent with this license and chapter, unless the city
authorizes a longer interruption of cable service; or
      2.   Immediately if the licensee wilfully and without cause refuses to
provide cable service over a substantial portion of the service area,
consistent with this license and chapter; and
In the event the city seeks injunctive relief, the city shall be entitled to
have the licensee immediately resume operation of the cable system and to
obtain such other injunctive relief which may be appropriate under the
circumstances.
   D.   Removal Of System Facilities: Within twelve (12) months of the lawful
termination of the license or the date upon which the licensee is last required
to provide cable service, whichever is later, the licensee shall remove its
system facilities from the public ways, unless the city exercises its purchase
option under subsection E of this section. If the licensee or any of its
assigns fails to remove the cable system within such time, that portion of the
cable system found in the public ways on subscriber property or other public
property shall be deemed abandoned.
   E.   City Option To Acquire Ownership: Without limiting any rights of the
city under other provisions of federal, state or local law:
      1.   If renewal of the license is denied, and such denial is upheld by a
final unappealable order, the city shall have an option to acquire ownership of
the cable system or require the licensee to transfer ownership to another
person. Any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value,
determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with
no value allocated to the license itself.
      2.   If the license is revoked for cause, and such revocation for cause
is upheld by a final unappealable order, the city shall have an option to
acquire ownership of the cable system or require the licensee to transfer
ownership to another person. Any such acquisition or transfer shall be at an
equitable price, as that term is used in section 627(b) of the cable act.
   F.   Licensee Selling To Third Party: Nothing in subsections A through D of
this section shall prevent the licensee from selling its cable system to a
third party during any transition period, or from selling unabandoned assets in
place prior to their removal; provided, that any successor in interest shall be
bound and must agree to be bound by all the obligations of the licensee under
this section, including specifically its obligation to remove or abandon
facilities as provided herein. Every such sale or other assignment shall be
subject to the approval as provided for in subsection 7-9A-7A of this chapter,
and further shall:
      1.   Agree in writing to comply with the terms of this section and to
assume and be bound by all of licensee's obligations under this section; and
      2.   Agree in writing to waive any claim or defense that, as a result of
the assignment or otherwise, it has a right to operate or maintain the cable
system, except as provided in this chapter, to construct a new cable system
without a license, to obtain a new license for the cable system or to renew any
authorization to operate or maintain the cable system under 47 USC section 546.
(1994 Code § 9-37)

The city shall notify the licensee of its intent to exercise the option to buy
upon termination for cause within six (6) months of the final determination of
the validity of the city's decision to terminate. The city and the licensee
shall enter into good faith negotiations promptly to establish price in
accordance with subsection 7-9D-6E2 of this article and terms and conditions
which reflect usual industry practices. (1994 Code § 9-38)
7-9D-8: EFFECT OF BOND LIMITATIONS:
A licensee's maintenance of the surety bonds or corporate guaranty required by
this chapter shall not be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by the
licensee or to limit the liability of the licensee to the amount of such bonds,
or otherwise to limit the city's recourse to any other remedy available under
this chapter. (1994 Code § 9-39)
7-9D-9: NOTICE OF TERMINATION TO CITY:
Any bond required by this chapter shall provide that at least thirty (30) days'
prior written notice of intention to cancel, materially change, or not to renew
must be given to the city by filing the same with the city clerk. (1994 Code §
9-40)

with any accumulated interest, on or before the forty fifth day after the end

maintain an action against the licensee for the amount of such fee and interest
and all expenses of collecting same, including reasonable attorney fees.

city's right to recovery of such licensing fee shall be deemed barred.

   A.   Notice: Upon the adoption of this article and the certification of the
city by the FCC, the city shall immediately notify all cable operators in the
city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the city intends to
regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated
equipment as authorized by the cable act of 1992.
   B.   Cable Operator Response: Within thirty (30) days of receiving notice
from the city, a cable operator shall file with the city, its current rates for
the basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material
concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   C.   Expedited Determination And Public Hearing.
      1.   If the mayor and board of commissioners are able to expeditiously
determine that the cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and
associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as
determined by the applicable benchmark, the mayor and board of commissioners
shall:
         a.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         b.   Act to approve the rates within thirty (30) days from the date
the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city.
      2.   If the mayor and board of commissioners take no action within thirty
(30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the
city, the proposed rates will continue in effect.
   D.   Extended Review Period:
      1.   If the mayor and board of commissioners are unable to determine
whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based
on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service
showing, the mayor and board of commissioners shall, within thirty (30) days
from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city and
by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of
time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         a.   Ninety (90) days if the mayor and board of commissioners need
more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard;
or
         b.   One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted
a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
      2.   If the mayor and board of commissioners have not made a decision
within the ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150) day period, the mayor and
board of commissioners shall issue a brief written order at the end of the
period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are
paid.
   E.   Public Hearing: During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the mayor and board of commissioners shall hold at
least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views
and record objections.
   F.   Objections: An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the
proposed initial basic rate may request the city clerk to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the city clerk with the objector's
name and address.
   G.   Benchmark Analysis: If a cable operator submits its current basic cable
rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard,
the mayor and board of commissioners shall review the rates using the benchmark
analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on
the mayor and board of commissioners' findings, the initial basic cable rates
shall be established as follows:
      1.   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates
will be capped at that level.
      2.   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by ten percent (10%), or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for
inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September
30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation.
      3.   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable
operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the
initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation.
   H.   Cost-Of-Service Showings: If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic
cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The mayor and board of
commissioners will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC
standards for cost-of-service review. The mayor and board of commissioners may
approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator
makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting
in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992,
rates minus ten percent (10%), will prescribe the cable operator's new rates.
   I.   Decision:
      1.   By Formal Resolution: After completion of its review of the cable
operator's proposed rates, the mayor and board of commissioners shall adopt its
decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
         a.   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the mayor and board of
commissioners shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable
operator; or
         b.   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
and the cost of service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the mayor and board of commissioners shall establish initial basic cable rates
that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a
cost- of-service analysis.
      2.   Rollbacks And Refunds: If the mayor and board of commissioners
determine that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable
rate standard or that the cable operator's cost- of-service showing justifies
lower rates, the mayor and board of commissioners may order the rates reduced
in accordance with subsection G or H of this section, as applicable. In
addition, the mayor and board of commissioners may order the cable operator to
pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest
(computed at applicable rates published by the internal revenue service for tax
refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The
method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with
FCC regulations as directed in the mayor and board of commissioners' decision
resolution.
      3.   Statement Of Reasons For Decision; Public Notice: If rates proposed
by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were
objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution must
state the reasons for the decision and the mayor and board of commissioners
must give public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by
advertisement once in the official newspaper of the city.
   J.   Appeal: The mayor and board of commissioners' decision concerning rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC
in accordance with applicable federal regulations. (1994 Code § 9-91)
7-9F-3: REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES:
   A.   Notice: A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the city and notify all subscribers at least thirty (30) days before the cable
operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more
often than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of
the initial basic cable rates.
   B.   Expedited Determination And Public Hearing:
      1.   If the mayor and board of commissioners are able to expeditiously
determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable
service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the
applicable price cap, the mayor and board of commissioners shall:
         a.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         b.   Act to approve the rate increase within thirty (30) days from the
date the cable operator filed its request with the city.
      2.   If the mayor and board of commissioners take no action within thirty
(30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city, the
proposed rates will go into effect.
   C.   Extended Review Period:
      1.   If the mayor and board of commissioners are unable to determine
whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on
the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service
showing, the mayor and board of commissioners shall, by adoption of a formal
resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to
make a final determination.
         a.   Ninety (90) days, if the mayor and board of commissioners need
more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable
rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and
         b.   One hundred fifty (150) days, if the cable operator has submitted
a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the
applicable price cap.
      2.   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      3.   If the mayor and board of commissioners have not made a decision
within the ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150) day period, the mayor and
board of commissioners shall issue a brief written order at the end of the
period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the
amounts are paid.
   D.   Public Hearing: During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, the mayor and board of commissioners
shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views and record objections.
   E.   Objections: An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the
proposed rate increase may request the city clerk to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the city clerk with the objector's
name and address.
   F.   Delayed Determination: If the mayor and board of commissioners are
unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase
within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into
effect, subject to subsequent refund if the mayor and board of commissioners
later issue a decision disapproving any portion of the increase.
   G.   Price Cap Analysis: If a cable operator presents its request for a rate
increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the mayor and board
of commissioners shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in
accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the mayor and
board of commissioners' findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as
follows:
      1.   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      2.   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the mayor and board of commissioners shall disapprove
the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the
price cap.
   H.   Cost-Of-Service Showings: If a cable operator submits a cost- of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
the mayor and board of commissioners will review the submission pursuant to the
FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The mayor and board of commissioners
may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the
necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate
below the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will
prescribe the cable operator's new rate.
   I.   Decision: The mayor and board of commissioners' decision concerning the
requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate
increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if
objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the
resolution must state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at
the public hearing by a person requesting the city clerk to record the
objection or may be submitted in writing at anytime before the decision
resolution is adopted.
   J.   Refunds:
      1.   The mayor and board of commissioners may order refunds of
subscribers' rate payments with interest if:
         a.   The mayor and board of commissioners were unable to make a
decision within the extended time period as described in subsection C of this
section; and
         b.   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         c.   The mayor and board of commissioners determine that the rate
increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable
operator failed to justify the rate increase by a cost- of-service showing, and
the mayor and board of commissioners disapprove any portion of the rate
increase.
      2.   The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the mayor and board of
commissioners' decision resolution.
   K.   Appeal: The mayor and board of commissioners' decision concerning rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC
in accordance with applicable federal regulations. (1994 Code § 9-92)
7-9F-4: CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION:
   A.   Requirements: The city may require:
      1.   In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates
or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the mayor
and board of commissioners may require the cable operator to produce
information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information,
if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may
request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section.
      2.   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, the mayor and board of commissioners may request additional
information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in
accord with the standard.
   B.   Request For Confidentiality:
      1.   A cable operator submitting information to the mayor and board of
commissioners may request in writing that the information not be made routinely
available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and
cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it
applies.
      2.   If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be
physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply.
If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request
applies shall be identified.
      3.   Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for
withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons
are based.
      4.   Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this
subsection shall not be considered.
   C.   Mayor And Board Of Commissioners Action:
      1.   Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection B of this
section will be acted upon by the mayor and board of commissioners. The mayor
and board of commissioners will grant the request if the cable operator
presents, by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure
consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the
ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from
public inspection.
      2.   If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the
mayor and board of commissioners deny the request, the mayor and board of
commissioners shall take one of the following actions:
         a.   If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any
direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the city return
the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with
this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so
requires, will the information be made available for public inspection.
         b.   If the information was required to be submitted by the mayor and
board of commissioners, the information will be made available for public
inspection.
   D.   Appeal: If the mayor and board of commissioners deny the request for
confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the
FCC within five (5) working days of the mayor and board of commissioners'
decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review.
(1994 Code § 9-93)
7-9F-5: AUTOMATIC RATE ADJUSTMENTS:
   A.   Annual Inflation Adjustment: In accordance with FCC regulations, the
cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic
service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index.
   B.   Other External Costs:
      1.   The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its
rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost
factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the
GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs,
state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service,
and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a
franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without
regard to its relation to the GNP-PI.
      2.   For all categories of external costs other than retransmission
consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external
costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the
date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February
28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be
adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees
incurred before October 6, 1994.
   C.   Notification And Review: The cable operator shall notify the city at
least thirty (30) days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic
adjustment items. The city shall review the increase to determine whether the
item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the city makes no objection
within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may
go into effect. (1994 Code § 9-94)
7-9F-6: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Refunds: The city may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers
a portion of previously paid rates under the following circumstances:
      1.   A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in
excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or
      2.   The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order
issued by the city.
   B.   Fines: If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or
refund order, the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for each day the cable operator fails to comply. (1994 Code §
9-95)
7-9F-7: CONTINGENT RATE REGULATION:
In the event this article is rendered inapplicable, the city shall regulate the
rates of the licensee for basic cable service and associated equipment in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the 1992 cable act and the FCC
regulations, as amended from time to time, and shall be authorized to take all
necessary and appropriate action in connection therewith. In connection with
such regulation, the city will ensure a reasonable opportunity for
consideration of the view of interested parties. (1994 Code § 9-100)

7-9G-1: GENERAL CONDITIONS ON USE:
   A.   Use Of Public Ways Restricted: The licensee may not endanger nor
unreasonably interfere with the lives or property of persons; unreasonably
interfere with property of the city or any public utility; or unnecessarily
hinder or obstruct use of the public ways. The license does not establish
priority for use of public ways over holders of other permits, licenses or
franchises; it grants no vested interest in occupying any particular position
in the public ways. The city shall control distribution of space in the public
ways, but may not exercise that authority unreasonably. No location of any pole
or wire holding structure shall give rise to a vested interest in city property
or public ways and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the
licensee at its expense whenever the city reasonably determines that the public
interest will be enhanced thereby.
   B.   Installation Of Cable System: The cable system shall be installed in
public ways and other places within the limits of the city subject to the
inspection and advance approval in close cooperation and coordination with the
city engineer and traffic engineer. The cable system, as near as practical,
shall be placed so that it is parallel to the uniform grade of the public ways,
and laid at least eighteen inches (18") below the surface, or suspended from
poles above, as may be approved by the city and/or owner of the poles. The
cable system shall be installed along public ways in as straight an alignment
as possible, staying to one side of the public way and avoiding unnecessary
crossings of public ways. All cable placed under streets, roads and other
public ways crossed by vehicular traffic shall be placed in conduit.
   C.   Subdivisions: Without obtaining the prior written approval of the city,
the licensee shall not install or erect its cable system in or on public
property, rights of way or in any privately owned area within the city that has
not yet become a public way, but is designated or delineated as a proposed
public way on any tentative subdivision plat that may be approved by the city,
except insofar as the cable system may be installed or erected on public
utility facilities then existing.
   D.   Construction Or Repairs Expeditiously Performed: The licensee shall
expeditiously carry out all of its operations during the course of any
construction, repairs or maintenance operations of the licensee on public ways.
   E.   Excavations:
      1.   If the licensee performs any excavation or other construction in any
portion of any public way, the licensee shall take all reasonable precautions
to protect the public from harm, including, but not limited to, the erection of
proper barriers and warning facilities. All barriers and related signs shall
conform to the manual on uniform traffic control devices. Paved streets shall
be bored and drilled when they are crossed beneath the ground by the licensee's
cable system so that the city's paved streets will not be unnecessarily
damaged. The city engineer, upon licensee's request, in his sole discretion,
may allow other construction methods when he finds that drilling or boring is
unreasonable and will not provide a sufficient public benefit for the cost.
      2.   All excavations shall be performed so as to create the least
inconvenience to the public, and in accordance with permits and manuals issued
by the city. The city shall have the right to control all excavations.
   F.   Installation Of Service Lines:
      1.   The licensee shall bury or suspend each of its service lines from
its main trunk lines to individual customers. In no event shall it allow its
cable to lie upon the ground, except as may be necessary during actual
construction or repair to the service line and in no event shall it be allowed
to remain upon the ground for more than thirty (30) days; provided, that the
licensee is not required to bury its cable within such time period between
December 15 and March 15, if the weather prevents it; provided, however, the
licensee shall use its good faith and best efforts to bury such cable as soon
thereafter as possible.
      2.   In the event the licensee fails to bury any cable within thirty (30)
days of the date of installation, as provided hereinabove, then the city shall
give the licensee a written objection to the delay. If licensee fails to
perform the work within ten (10) days after receipt of the notice, the city may
provide for disbursements from the security fund as provided in section
7-9D-2 of this title. (1994 Code § 9-57)
7-9G-2: HINDRANCE TO PUBLIC WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS PROHIBITED:
   A.   Compliance With City Instructions: The licensee shall, at its cost,
install, construct, operate and maintain its cable system as directed by the
city or other authorized government entity so as to permit the city or other
authorized government entity to install, construct, maintain or operate any
public works, public improvements or publicly owned facilities or systems.
   B.   Temporary Removal Upon Request From City:
      1.   Upon its receipt of reasonable advance written notice, not less than
five (5) business days, the licensee, at its expense, shall protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its cable system as requested by the
city for reasons of traffic conditions, public health and safety, and
protection of property, construction, repair, maintenance or relocation of any
public way, grade change, or construction, relocation, installation or
maintenance of any public works, public improvements, or other publicly owned
facilities or systems.
      2.   If, after providing the hereinabove notice, the licensee fails to
remove or relocate its cable system as required by the city, the city may
remove or relocate the licensee's cable system, and the licensee shall
compensate the city for all reasonable expenses incurred thereby; provided,
however, the licensee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its
property where such property is located underground.
   C.   Strand Map: The licensee, upon thirty (30) days' written notice from
the city engineer, shall supply the city with a strand map showing the location
of its facilities as the city may require for the design and planning of public
ways and public works, public improvements and other public facilities and
systems. This section does not require the licensee to provide as built maps
unless those are the only maps that show the actual location of the licensee's
facilities. Thereafter, the licensee shall not move or alter the location of
the portion of its cable system specifically located by the terms of this
subsection without compliance with the general notice requirements of this
license and chapter. The notice shall state that the portion of the cable
system moved had been located for city design and planning purposes. The
licensee shall perform the work required to locate its cable system at no cost
to the city. In addition, the licensee shall maintain membership in Oklahoma
One-Call System, Inc. (OKIE), and abide by its bylaws, rules and regulations.
(1994 Code § 9-58; amd. 2003 Code)
7-9G-3: REMOVAL OR RELOCATION IN EVENT OF EMERGENCY:
In event of emergency, or where the cable system creates or is contributing to
an imminent danger to health, safety or property, the city may remove or
relocate licensee's cable system without prior notice. (1994 Code § 9-59)
7-9G-4: RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS AND PRIVATE PROPERTY:
   A.   Protection Of Property:
      1.   The licensee shall expeditiously carry out all of its operations
during the course of any construction, operation or maintenance operations on
public or private property other than the licensee's private property. The
licensee, at its cost, shall protect public and private property in order to
prevent damage caused by the construction, installation, maintenance or
operation of its cable system. If the licensee fails to protect such property,
the city may do so, and the licensee shall compensate the city for all
reasonable expenses incurred thereby.
      2.   The licensee, without undue delay, and at its expense, shall
restore, repair or replace public or private property to as good a condition as
prior to the disturbance, or compensate property owners for damage caused by
the licensee. Restoration, repair or replacement of public ways shall be
completed within at least ten (10) days, and restoration, repair or replacement
of private property, with the exception of licensee's private property,
completed within at least thirty (30) days, except in those cases where the
restoration, by its nature, cannot be completed in that period, even with the
exercise of due diligence. The licensee shall take all proper steps to ensure
that any resurfacing or reconstruction of public ways rests upon a properly
filled and tamped foundation.
      3.   The licensee may trim trees and other vegetation from public ways,
at its expense and subject, at the city's option, to the city's supervision.
Prior to the trimming of any tree, the licensee shall submit a tree trimming
plan from a graduate forester or landscape architect, which plan shall be
approved by the city engineer, and all work shall be in accordance with such
plan. The purpose of this requirement is to protect the aesthetics and beauty
of the community by preventing the stumping and otherwise destruction of the
integrity and beauty of trees in the community.
      4.   Upon request and for good cause shown, the city engineer may
authorize an extension of the period within which the licensee may perform its
restoration work.
   B.   Notify Property Owner Of Damage: The licensee shall notify any person
whose property is damaged by the licensee within four (4) hours of the time the
damage is discovered or occurring, whichever is first. At a minimum, this
section requires the licensee to place a prominent notice in a prominent place
on the damaged property, and to make diligent efforts to contact the property
owner or resident directly. (1994 Code § 9-60)
7-9G-5: AERIAL AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION:
With regard to all areas of new construction or line extension, where the
transmission and distribution facilities of public utilities providing

   A.   Placement Of Facilities: The city shall require to be provided and
operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurements of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
system. The monitoring facility should normally be situated in the user's
premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles. The user shall be responsible for relocation of
the facility, if necessary, for street improvements or public utility
construction, maintenance or repairs. The monitoring facility designed by the
industrial user as the proper sampling site for regulated categorical or
industrial processes will be approved by the city prior to the use of such
facility.
   B.   Sampling Manhole: There shall be ample room in or near such sampling
manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at
all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   C.   Compliance With City Standards: Whether constructed on public or
private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in
accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction
standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety
(90) days following written notification by the city.

particular industrial subcategory and if they are more stringent than the local
limitations, then the categorical standards shall immediately supersede the
local limitations imposed in this chapter. (1994 Code § 34-111)
8-3E-2: NOTICE OF NEW FEDERAL STANDARDS; APPEAL PROCEDURE:
   A.   Determination Of Affected Users; Notice: In the event new, or revised,
federal categorical pretreatment standards are mandated and promulgated by EPA,
the environmental compliance specialist will analyze such standards and
determine which users are affected thereby. After the environmental compliance
specialist makes such determination, the affected users shall be notified in
writing of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR section 403.12.
   B.   Contesting Determination:
      1.   After receipt of the notice mentioned in subsection A of this
section, any user may contest the determination of the environmental compliance
specialist by addressing a letter of protest to the environmental compliance
specialist within ten (10) days from the date such notice is received.
      2.   The environmental compliance specialist, after receipt of the
protest, shall review the new standards and respond, in writing, to the protest
within thirty (30) calendar days from the receipt of protest.
      3.   If, after the completion of this review, the environmental
compliance specialist issues a determination that the new or revised

protest must be submitted to the Oklahoma department of environmental quality.
(1994 Code § 34-112)
8-3E-3: MODIFICATION OF STANDARDS:
The city may modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment
standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR part 403.7 are fulfilled and
prior approval from the ODEQ or EPA is obtained. (1994 Code § 34-113)
8-3E-4: COMPLIANCE DATE REPORT:
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement
of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to
pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the environmental
compliance specialist a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow
for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user. (1994 Code § 34-114)
8-3E-5: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS:
The environmental compliance specialist may impose mass limitations on users
which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass or concentration
limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report shall indicate the mass
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or long term
production rates and mass, where requested by the environmental compliance
specialist, of pollutants contained therein, which are limited by the
applicable pretreatment standard. For all other users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measures of operation), this report shall include
the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standard. (1994 Code § 34-115)
8-3E-6: SAMPLING FROM CATEGORICAL INDUSTRIAL USERS:
All samples from significant categorical industrial users shall be taken
immediately downstream from their pretreatment facilities or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. The samples
shall be taken before the effluent joins or is diluted by any other
wastestream, body of water or substance. If other wastewaters are mixed with
the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, and cannot be separated, the
user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the
combined wastestream formula in order to evaluate compliance with the
pretreatment standards. Monitoring points shall not be changed without
notification to, and the approval of, the environmental compliance specialist.
All pretreatment equipment must be routinely inspected and maintained to ensure
compliance. (1994 Code § 34-116)
8-3E-7: PRETREATMENT:
   A.   User Responsibility For Compliance; Expense: Users shall provide and
operate at all times necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with
this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical
pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal
pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a
level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
user's expense. The categorical industrial user shall control production of all
discharges, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment
facility, until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment
is provided. Proper operation and maintenance includes, but is not limited to,
adequate laboratory controls, effective performance, adequate operator staffing
and training, and quality assurance procedures. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city
for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the
facility.
   B.   Modifications Acceptable To City: The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent change in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
   C.   Availability Of Records: All records relating to compliance with
pretreatment standards shall be made available to the city, ODEQ or the EPA
upon request. (1994 Code § 34-117)
8-3E-8: NET/GROSS CALCULATIONS:
Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of
pollutants in the industrial user's intake water. The industrial user must
demonstrate that categorical pretreatment standards would be met in the absence
of pollutants in the intake water. Upon request of the user, the applicable
standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit
for pollutants in the intake water) by the city. (1994 Code § 34-118)
8-3E-9: COMBINED WASTESTREAM FORMULA:
Where process effluent is mixed prior to treatment with wastewaters other than
that generated by the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may
be derived by the city, or by the industrial user with the written concurrence
of the city. These alternative limits shall be applied to the mixed effluent.
When deriving alternative categorical limits, the city or industrial user shall
calculate both an alternative daily maximum value using the daily maximum value
(s) specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards and an
alternative consecutive sampling day average value using the monthly average
value(s) specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards.
   A.   Alternative Limits Below Detection Limit: An alternative pretreatment
limit may not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical
detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants.
   B.   Monitoring: Where a treated regulated process wastestream is combined
prior to treatment with wastestreams other than those generated by the
regulated process, the industrial user may monitor either the segregated
process wastestream or the combined wastestream for the purpose of determining
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. If the industrial user
chooses to monitor the segregated process wastestream, it shall apply the
applicable categorical pretreatment standards. If the user chooses to monitor
the combined wastestream, it shall apply an alternative discharge limit
calculated using the combined wastestream formula. The industrial user may
change monitoring points only after receiving approval from the city. The city
shall ensure that any change in an industrial user's monitoring point(s) will
not allow the user to substitute dilution for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with applicable standards. (1994 Code § 34-119)

concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process
which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average
and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are
limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state
whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on
a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance (O&M)
and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified by
a qualified professional.
   D.   Report Of Changed Conditions: Industrial users shall give notice to the

increased or reduced discharges (of 10 percent or greater) or a change in the
nature of the discharge or the increased or decreased concentrations of
pollutants to the POTW.
      1.   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s)
until and unless the environmental compliance specialist has responded to the
industrial user's notice.
      2.   For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of ten percent
(10%) or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants,
shall be deemed significant.
   E.   User Give Notice Of Changes: Any new source or any existing user, whose
discharges are subject to federal categorical pretreatment standards, or any
significant noncategorical industrial user, shall notify the environmental
compliance specialist of any of the following changes of condition, within
thirty (30) days prior to the occurrence of such changes, the same being as
follows:
      1.   Transfer of ownership;
      2.   Change of product line;
      3.   Alterations of discharge volume, flow rate, character, chemical
composition, etc.;
      4.   Facility expansion; or
      5.   Production increase.
   F.   Hazardous Waste Notification:
      1.   The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste
management division director, and ODEQ hazardous waste authorities in writing
of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261.
      2.   The contacts are: EPA Region VI, Director, Hazardous Waste
Management Division, 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 1200, Dallas, Texas, 75202; and
the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, Hazardous Waste Management
Services, 1000 NE 10th Street, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73117-1299.
      3.   Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste, the
EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or
other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms
of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also
contain: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes; an estimate of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharge during the calendar month; and an estimation of the mass
of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the effective date of this rule. Any notification
needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
      4.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirement during a calendar month
in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous
wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of
nonacute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one time notification.
      5.   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of the
resource conservation and recovery act (RCRA) listing any additional substances
as hazardous wastes, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional
waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities
of the discharge of such substances within ninety (90) days of the effective
date of such regulation.
      6.   In case of notification to the POTW, the industrial user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical. (1994 Code §§ 34-124.1, 34-124.2, 34-124.3, 34-124.4, 34-124.5, 34-

8-3G-4: Retention Of Records
8-3G-5: Confidential Information
8-3G-6: Industrial Users In Significant Noncompliance
8-3G-1: PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS:
   A.   Time Of Reporting; Basis For Reporting:
      1.   Any significant categorical industrial user subject to a
pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard,
or in the case of a new source, after the commencement of the discharge into
the POTW, or any significant noncategorical industrial user, shall submit to
the environmental compliance specialist, during the months of June and December
or July and January, depending upon the requirements as specified in the
industrial user permits, unless the reports are required more frequently in the
pretreatment or local standards or by order of the environmental compliance
specialist, the report shall indicate the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment or local
standards.
      2.   These reports shall be based on appropriate sampling and analysis
performed in the period covered by the report in which data is representative
of the volume and nature of discharge occurring during the reporting period,
and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR part 136,
and amendments thereto.
      3.   If the industrial user monitors any pollutants more frequently than
required by the city, the results of this monitoring shall be included in this
report if this monitoring data conforms to 40 CFR part 136. The results of such
monitoring shall be included in any calculations of actual daily maximum or
monthly average pollutants discharged, and the results shall be reported in the
semiannual report submitted to the city. In addition, this report shall include
a record of all average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period.
      4.   At the discretion of the environmental compliance specialist, and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, or similar variables, the environmental compliance specialist may agree
to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
      5.   If the industrial user wastewater analysis indicates a violation has
occurred, the user must inform the city within twenty four (24) hours, repeat
the sampling and pollutant analysis, and submit in writing to the city the
results of the second analysis within thirty (30) days of violation awareness.
At a minimum, the results of this second analysis shall be submitted in writing
to the city within five (5) days of receiving the results from the contract
laboratory.
   B.   Sampling And Analytical Procedures: In the event 40 CFR part 136 does
not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the EPA publication, "Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening
of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977", and amendments
thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the
administrator of EPA.
   C.   Failure To Report; Written Warnings Issued:
      1.   In the event a periodic compliance report provided for in this
section is not filed with the city on its due date, the environmental
compliance specialist shall issue a maximum of three (3) written warnings to
the user who fails to comply with this provision.
      2.   These warnings shall be issued at five (5) day intervals, with the
first warning given five (5) days after the original due date of such report.
If a user does not respond to the warning, or in the event the user wholly
fails to file a report, the environmental compliance specialist shall take the
appropriate enforcement response. (1994 Code § 34-125)
8-3G-2: ANALYSIS OF WASTEWATER:
   A.   Sampling; Control Manhole:
      1.   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
wastewater to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in
accordance with 40 CFR part 136 entitled "Guidelines Establishing Test
Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants" 1991, or amendments thereto, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole in the event that no special manhole has been
required. The control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected.
      2.   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all outfalls of the
premises are appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.)
   B.   Documentation; Shipment To Laboratory: Chain-of-custody documentation
will be completed, bottles will be labeled and marked, and the samples will be
iced, if necessary, prior to shipment to the contract laboratory. The proper
type of container and preservative will be used depending upon the parameter
sampled, per 40 CFR part 136.
   C.   Contents Of Records: Records of sampling and analyses shall include:
      1.   The date, exact place, time, and type of sampling or measurements,
and sample preservation techniques or procedures;
      2.   The individual(s) who obtained the sampling or field measurements;
      3.   Chain-of-custody documentation; and
      4.   Samples shipped at four degrees Celsius (4°C) or thirty nine degrees
Fahrenheit (39°F).
   D.   Flow Proportional Sampling: Significant industrial users (SIUs) are
required to use twenty four (24) hour flow proportional composite sampling
where feasible. Where flow proportional sampling is not feasible (as determined
by the city and specified in the individual user permits), time proportional
samples are preferred. When time proportional samples are collected to make a
composite sample, at least one sample will be collected every thirty (30)
minutes (or as often as the city determines is necessary) during the sampling
period. When neither flow proportional nor time proportional sampling is
possible, grab samples may be used to make a composite. At least one sample
will be collected one and one-half (11/2) hours apart, four (4) times a day
when grab samples are used for composting. Samples will be collected during a
normal operating period.
   E.   Grab Samples: Grab samples are also collected when required by the
pollutant obtained. There are six (6) named pollutants for which grab sampling
is required. The pollutants are: pH, total cyanide, total phenol, total oil and
grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. When grab samples are collected, a
minimum of one sample will be taken for each pollutant during the operating
day.
   F.   Minimum Sampling Requirements: When significant industrial users (SIUs)
are required to collect wastewater samples by the city, these facilities shall
obtain, at least semiannually, one twenty four (24) hour flow proportional
composite or one time proportional sample for the indicated pollutants,
depending upon the parameter, to comply with minimum sampling requirements.
(1994 Code § 34-126)
8-3G-3: SELF-MONITORING VERSUS CITY MONITORING:
Self-monitoring sampling and analysis for the industrial user may be performed
by the city. If the city collects all the information required for the self-
monitoring report, including flow data, the industrial user will not be
required to submit the self-monitoring report. (1994 Code § 34-127)
8-3G-4: RETENTION OF RECORDS:
   A.   Period Of Retention:
      1.   The user shall retain records of all facility monitoring/maintenance
information, copies of all reports required, and records of all data for a
period of at least three (3) years from the date of the sample, measurement,
report or application.
      2.   This period may be extended by request of the city at any time.
   B.   Enforcement Response Or Litigation Activities: All records that pertain
to matters that are the subject of consent orders or any other enforcement
response or litigation activities brought by the city shall be retained and
preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all
periods of limitations with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
   C.   Records Required: The following records shall be contained in the
periodic compliance report or in the chain-of-custody documentation provided by
the industrial user:
      1.   The date(s) and times analyses were performed for each parameter;
      2.   The individual(s) initials who performed the analyses;
      3.   The analytical techniques or methods used;
      4.   Results received from blank, duplicate, percent recovery and spike
samples.
      5.   Name of chief chemist responsible for analyses;
      6.   Oklahoma department of environmental quality certification number,
or any other agency named to take over the responsibilities of overseeing
commercial laboratories; and
      7.   The results of such analyses. (1994 Code § 34-128)
8-3G-5: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
   A.   Certain Information Open To Public: Information and data on a user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permit and
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agency, including the EPA, without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the city that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of
the user.
   B.   Certain Information Confidential: When requested by the person
furnishing the report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental
agencies for uses related to this article, the national pollution discharge
elimination system (NPDES) permit, state disposal permit and/or the
pretreatment program; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall
be available for use by the state agency in judicial review of enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
   C.   Notice To User: Information accepted by the city as confidential shall
not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the
city until and unless a ten (10) day notification is given to the user by
certified mail. (1994 Code § 34-129)
8-3G-6: INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
   A.   Publication Of List: The city shall annually publish in the Enid News
and Eagle Newspaper a list of significant industrial users (SIUs) which, at any
time during the previous five (5) quarters were in significant noncompliance
with applicable pretreatment requirements or standards.
   B.   Criteria Determining Noncompliance: For the purpose of this provision,
a significant industrial user (SIU) is in significant noncompliance if its
violation meets one or more of the following criteria:
      1.   "Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits", defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of all of the measurements taken
during a six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit
or the long term average limit for the same pollutant parameter.
      2.   "Technical review criteria (TRC) violations", defined here as those
in which thirty three percent (33%) or more of all of the measurements for each
pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period that is equal to or
exceeds the product or the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied
by the applicable TRC (1.4 times the limit for BOD5, TSS, fat and O&G and 1.2
times the limit for all other pollutants except pH).
      3.   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum
or long term average) that the city determines has proximately caused, alone or
in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public).
      4.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health, welfare, or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
      5.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in the permit or enforcement order for
starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance.
      6.   Failure to provide, within thirty (30) days after the due date,
required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90) day
compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and compliance schedule
milestone reports.
      7.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
      8.   Any other violation or group of violations that the city determines
will adversely affect the operations or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
   C.   Notice Summarize Enforcement Actions: The notification shall also
summarize any enforcement actions take against significant industrial users
during the same five (5) quarters.
   D.   Records Available To Officials: All records relating to compliance with
pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or ODEQ
upon request. (1994 Code § 34-130)

         b.   The director of engineering services;
         c.   Two (2) representatives from among the significant industrial
users; and
         d.   A resident member.
      2.   The chairman of the board will be the director of engineering
services.
      3.   Each significant industrial user may designate a representative to
serve on the board on a rotation basis. The representatives will be placed on a
rotation list, and two (2) industrial representatives will be called to serve
for each hearing. If the representative's industry is before the board when its
representative is called, that representative will be skipped and the next
industrial representative will be called to serve. The rotation list will be
kept by the chairman of the board, and the chairman will be in charge of
developing the rotation system.
      4.   A resident member is to be appointed by the mayor and board of
commissioners after the city clerk has advertised for residents of the city to
apply if they are interested in serving on the environmental enforcement board.
The qualifications for the resident member are that they reside within the city
limits and have an interest in environmental matters, and are not an employee
or principal of a significant industrial user. The term for a resident member
is three (3) years, and said member serves at the pleasure of the mayor and
board of commissioners.
   B.   Meetings: The board shall meet as required upon receiving notice of
appeal. Reasonable notice of the place, time and date of such meeting shall be
given to all members of the board.
   C.   Duties: The duty of the environmental enforcement board is to hear
appeals from the decisions made at administrative hearings. These appeals will
be conducted as trial de novos. Written findings will be made at the conclusion
of each hearing and deliberations will occur in executive session.
   D.   Decisions: All decisions of the environmental enforcement board are
final unless appealed pursuant to 12 Oklahoma Statutes section 951 to Garfield

8-3H-2: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING; SEARCH WARRANTS:
   A.   Inspections:
      1.   The city, ODEQ, or EPA, bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing in accordance with
the provisions of this article. The city or its representatives shall have no
authority to inquire into any processes including metallurgical, chemical, oil,
refining, ceramic, paper or other industries beyond that point having a direct
bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the sewers or natural outlet or
waters of the state or POTW.
      2.   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred
to in subsection A1 of this section, the city, ODEQ, and EPA employees shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company,
and the company may be held responsible for injury or death to the city, state
or EPA employees' gauging and sampling operations, caused by negligence or
failure of the company to maintain safe conditions as required by this article.
These city, state and EPA employees shall not sign any release or waiver of
liability form prior to entering these premises.
      3.   All duly authorized employees of the city, ODEQ, and EPA bearing
proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private
properties through which the city holds a duly negotiated easement for the
purposes of, but not limited to, inspections, observation, measurement,
sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying
within the easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement,
shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement
pertaining to the private property involved.
   B.   Inspection And Sampling:
      1.   The city shall inspect the facilities of any significant or
categorical industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is
being met and all requirements are being complied with at least once per year.
Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged
shall allow the city or their representative ready access at all reasonable
times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying on site if needed, or in the performance of any
of their other duties. The city, ODEQ, and the EPA shall have the authority and
right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a
user has security measures in force which would require proper identification
and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make
arrangements with their security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city, ODEQ and EPA will be permitted to
enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.
      2.   The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
industrial user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow
and quality shall be calibrated (periodically) to ensure their accuracy.
      3.   The city shall randomly sample and analyze the effluent from
industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify,
independently of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and
continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards. The city shall inspect
and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user (SIU) at least
once a year.
   C.   Search Warrants: If the environmental compliance specialist has been
refused access to a building, structure or property or any part thereof, and if
the environmental compliance specialist has demonstrated probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this article or that there is a need
to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to
verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or
to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then
upon application by the city attorney, the applicable judge of the city shall
issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the specific location
subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be
searched and or seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be served
at reasonable hours by the environmental compliance specialist in the company
of a uniformed police officer of the city. In the event of an emergency
affecting public health and safety, inspections shall be made without the
issuance of a warrant. (1994 Code §§ 34-131. 1, 34-131.2, 34-131.3)
8-3H-3: NONCOMPLIANCE; NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
   A.   Failure To File Compliance Report; Warnings: In the event a periodic
compliance report is not filed with the city on its due date, the environmental
compliance specialist shall issue a maximum of three (3) written warnings to
the user who fails to comply. These warnings shall be issued at five (5) day
intervals, with the first warning given five (5) days after the original due
date of such report. If a user does not respond to the warning or in the event
the user wholly fails to file a report, the environmental compliance specialist
will issue a notice of violation.
   B.   Administrative Notice: Whenever the environmental compliance specialist
determines that there is a possibility of a violation of the local limits, an
administrative notice will be mailed to the industrial user. The user must
immediately resample the questionable result and submit the analysis within
thirty (30) days of violation awareness. If the second analysis indicates a
violation has occurred, a notice of violation (NOV) will be issued to said
user.
   C.   Notice Of Violation:
      1.   Whenever the environmental compliance specialist finds that any user
is in violation of this article, the environmental compliance specialist may
serve upon said user a written notice of violation (NOV) by certified mail,
return receipt requested. The user must, within five (5) working days of the
receipt of this notice, submit to the environmental compliance specialist an
explanation of the violation and its intended course of corrective action,
including the estimated date by which corrective action will be completed, and
a plan to prevent further violations. After receipt of this response, the
environmental compliance specialist will periodically inspect and monitor the
corrective action taken by the user. The environmental compliance specialist
may grant reasonable extensions to the deadline date. The financial condition
of the user shall not be considered in establishing deadlines or extensions.
      2.   Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after the receipt of the notice of violation
(NOV), nor does this section limit the authority of the city to take any
action, including emergency action, without first issuing a notice of
violation.
      3.   If the user fails to respond to a notice of violation within the
required time period, or if the user fails to complete the corrective action by
the deadline, this failure constitutes a separate violation under this article,
and the city shall use the enforcement response plan to determine the
appropriate response. (1994 Code §§ 34-132.1, 34-132.2, 34-132.3)
8-3H-4: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES:
   A.   Supporting Evidence: An industrial user who complies with the
notification provisions of section
8-3A-11 of this chapter in a timely manner shall have an affirmative defense to
any enforcement action brought by the city for any noncompliance with this
article or permit issued to the user due to noxious, malodorous or toxic
liquids, gases, vapors, fumes or solids if properly signed operational logs or

(1994 Code § 34-133)
8-3H-5: REMEDIES BY USERS; CITY ACTION UPON NONCOMPLIANCE:
   A.   Consent Orders: The environmental compliance specialist is hereby
authorized to enter into consent orders with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such orders will include the specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the
order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative
orders issued pursuant to subsections B and C of this section and shall be
judicially enforceable.
   B.   Compliance Schedule:
      1.   If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be
required of the user to meet the pretreatment standards, a compliance schedule
will be developed by the environmental compliance specialist for the user. A
compliance schedule may be made a part of a consent order, an administrative
order or a ruling of the environmental enforcement board. The user shall meet
the shortest schedule by which to provide all such additional pretreatment.
      2.   The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
completion date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The
following conditions shall apply to this schedule:
         a.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation or additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards.
         b.   No increment referred to in this section shall exceed nine (9)
months.
         c.   No later than fourteen (14) days following each compliance date,
the user shall submit a progress report to the environmental compliance
specialist, and a final report must be submitted within fourteen (14) days from
the final compliance date as well.
         d.   The report should include, at a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date. If it did not
comply, the report must contain the date on which it expects to comply with
this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by
the user to return the construction to the schedule established.
      3.   Compliance schedules may also contain other requirements to address
the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer.
      4.   A compliance schedule shall not be a prerequisite for taking any
other action against the user.
   C.   Cease And Desist Orders:
      1.   When the environmental compliance specialist finds that a user is in
violation of this article, or based upon the user's past history, similar
violations are likely to reoccur, the environmental compliance specialist may
issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations. A cease and desist order may require the user to:
         a.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and/or
         b.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation up to and
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      2.   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to
taking any other action against the user.
   D.   Cost Recovery: Any user violating any of the provisions of this article
or who causes damage to or otherwise inhibits the POTW, shall be assessed by
the environmental compliance specialist the amount of any expense, loss, or
damage which was proximately caused by such violation or discharge. These costs
may include sampling and monitoring expenses and the cost of any actual damages
incurred by the city or the POTW. The environmental compliance specialist shall
bill the user for the cost incurred by the city for any cleaning, repair, or
replacement work and enforcement costs caused by the violation or discharge.
This bill is in addition to any criminal penalty applicable under this article.
   E.   Emergency Suspension:
      1.   The environmental compliance specialist may immediately suspend a
user's discharge into the POTW and/or wastewater discharge permit whenever such
suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, or threatens to cause
interference with the POTW, the waters of the state, or threatens to result in
a violation of the city's NPDES permit. Any user notified of a suspension of
its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution.
      2.   In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the environmental compliance specialist shall take
such steps as deemed necessary, (to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, the
waters of the state or endangerment to any individuals) to include: revocation
of the permit, termination of discharge or immediate water supply severance.
      3.   A user that is responsible in whole or in part for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any further occurrence to the environmental compliance specialist
within fifteen (15) days of the date of the order of emergency suspension.
      4.   Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing or formal notice prior to any emergency suspension order.
      5.   The environmental compliance specialist will lift the emergency
suspension when the user has demonstrated that the period of endangerment has
passed.
   F.   Revocation Of Permit: Any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to having their permit revoked:
      1.   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of their discharge;
      2.   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations;
      3.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection and monitoring;
      4.   Violation of conditions of the permit; or
      5.   Failure to pay cost recovery, administrative penalty, or to perform
specific remedies such as posting performance bonds.
   G.   Termination Of Discharge Into City Sewer System: The wastewater
discharge into the city's sewer system by industrial users may be terminated
for any of the following reasons:
      1.   Falsifying self-monitoring reports concerning wastewater
constituents and characteristics of the discharge.
      2.   Tampering with monitoring equipment.
      3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to the discharge.
      4.   Refusing to allow timely access to the facility, premises, and
records.
      5.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
      6.   Failure to meet effluent limitations.

   H.   Water Supply Severance: Whenever a user has violated the provisions of
this article, orders or wastewater discharge permits, water service to the user
may be severed. Service will only recommence at the user's expense, after the
user has satisfactorily complied with all the requirements assessed against
such user by the city. (1994 Code §§ 34-134.1, 34-134.2, 34-134.3, 34-134.4,
34-134.5, 34-134.6, 34-134.7, 34-134.8)
8-3H-6: APPEALS FROM ORDERS OF CITY; HEARING PROCEDURE:
If said user disputes the appropriateness of the enforcement response of the
environmental compliance specialist, or the validity of the violation, the user
may request an administrative hearing before the public utilities director to
review said order. The request must be in writing and must specify the reasons
for appeal. It must be filed with the city clerk within fifteen (15) days from
receipt of the appealed from order.
   A.   Administrative Hearing:
      1.   Whenever any user causes or contributes to a violation of this
article and the environmental compliance specialist determines that the
appropriate enforcement response includes revocation of a permit, termination
of discharge or water supply severance, and the situation does not rise to the
level of an emergency suspension, the environmental compliance specialist will
issue an order requiring the user to appear before the public utilities
director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken.
         a.   Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reason for such
action. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by certified
mail, return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.
Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user.
         b.   Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement
action may be pursued following the hearing date.
         c.   An administrative hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking
any other action against the user.
      2.   Administrative hearings will also be held when a user appeals an
order of the environmental compliance specialist.
   B.   Appeals From Administrative Hearings:
      1.   If said user disputes the administrative order made by the public
utilities director at an administrative hearing, it may appeal to the
environmental enforcement board by filing a written request with the city clerk
within fifteen (15) days from the administrative hearing. The user must state
in its written request the finding objected to, the reason for said appeal, and
the alternative it seeks.
      2.   Whether the user disputes the appropriateness of the enforcement
response or the validity of the violation, or both, an appeal bond equal to the
amount of any and all monetary penalties assessed, or if none are assessed, in
the amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) must accompany said appeal
request.
      3.   Failure to submit a petition for review shall be deemed to be a
waiver of the appeal. (1994 Code §§ 34-135, 34-135.1, 34-135.2)
8-3H-7: PERFORMANCE BOND TO GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE:
   A.   Bond May Be Required: The environmental compliance specialist, public
utilities director, or environmental enforcement board may require the posting
of a performance bond prior to the lifting of a suspension order, reissuing a
wastewater discharge permit, or reconnecting the water supply or sewer service.
   B.   Bond Amount: The bond is to be payable to the city in a sum not to
exceed a value determined by the city to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance and to protect or restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by
similar violations. (1994 Code § 34-136)
8-3H-8: LEGAL ACTIONS:
   A.   Injunctive Relief And Civil Penalties: Whenever a user has violated a
pretreatment standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of
this article, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment requirement, the city may seek a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
article on activities of the industrial user. Such other action as appropriate
for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by the city, including any
action for damages, reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses
associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
   B.   Remedies Nonexclusive: The provisions of this article are not exclusive
remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. The city's enforcement responses
will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan.
However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant, to include pursuit of civil litigation in state,
district and/or federal courts for damages, injunctive relief and/or specific
performance. (1994 Code § 34-137)
8-3H-9: CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Violations: Any user that wilfully or negligently violates any
provision of this article, any orders or wastewater discharge permits issued

punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per
violation per day.
   E.   Separate Offense For Each Day: Each day on which a violation occurs
shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.
   F.   Considerations For Assessing Penalty: The penalties will be assessed on
an incremental basis at the sole discretion of the assessor and will take into
consideration the nature of the violation, the good faith of the user, the
compliance history of the user, and the effect of the violation on the POTW or

delinquency shall be cause for immediate discontinuing or disconnecting of the
water connection or refuse collection service or both.
      2.   Penalties, charges and fees shall be paid before either or both the
refuse collection service and water service are reestablished. The stoppage of
services for nonpayment of collection charges shall be in addition to the right

Chapter 15 Roof Assemblies And Rooftop Structures is hereby amended to add the
following language:
Section 1507.1.1 Declaration Of Policy is hereby created to read as follows:
The mayor and board of commissioners of the city of Enid has determined that
the use of wood shingles upon a building or structure increase the hazard that
the flames of a nearby fire may spread to that building or structure. Further,
the use of wood shingles may increase insurance rates charged to the owner
because of the susceptibility of said shingles to be damaged as a result of
hailstorm events. Because of these findings, the commission believes that the
citizens of the city of Enid should not be compelled by restrictive covenants
to use wood shingles for their homes, building or other structures and that the
health, safety and welfare of said citizens should be promoted by making such
requirements invalid and unenforceable. The commission is also aware, however,
that developers and residents of subdivision protected by such restrictive
covenants are vitally interested in maintaining the aesthetic value of their
neighborhood and that any law declaring these covenants to be invalid and
unenforceable should also recognize the interest of these developers and
residents.
Section 1507.1.2 Covenants Requiring Use Of Wood Shingles Invalid And
Unenforceable is hereby created to read as follows: All parts of all
restrictive covenants contained in any deed, contract, plat or other instrument

within the city of Enid, Oklahoma, are hereby declared to be invalid and
unenforceable effective January 1, 1999.
Section 1507.1.3 Option Of Owner Subject To Such Restrictive Covenants is
hereby created to read as follows: Pursuant to the declaration set forth in
subsection 1507.1.1 above, the owner of any building or structure subject to a
restrictive covenant requiring the use of wood shingles shall have the option
to substitute roof covering materials compatible in color and appearance with
the existing roofs in the same subdivision. The determination of compatibility
shall be made by the architectural, or building committee or other similar
committee of each subdivision; provided, however, that if there is no such
committee in existence for a particular subdivision, then the determination of
compatibility shall be made by the code administrator.
Section 1507.1.4. Limitations is hereby created to read as follows: The
provisions of section 1507.1.2 shall not be construed to abridge or abrogate
the authority of architectural or building committees of subdivisions in any
respect other than the right to enforce restrictive covenants requiring the use
of wood shingles. All other restrictive covenants shall remain in full force
and effect.

9-1A-1: SCOPE:
Environmental noise affects substantial amounts of land area within the United
States. Through many years of research by a number of agencies and groups, it
has been determined that exterior noise may be isolated and reduced in living
and working environments through design and construction techniques, and noise
attenuation, which selectively decrease the sound entering occupied structures
from the outside. The noise reduction required is based upon calculations of
noise exposure, with the index of noise exposure including the noise level, its
duration, frequency of occurrence, and time of day of the occurrence. (Ord. 04-
04, 1-6-2004)
9-1A-2: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
The planning administrator, or his designee, shall administer and enforce these
regulations. Regular inspections shall be made to ensure construction is
performed to the specifications submitted and approved. Whenever it appears
that variations from the sound attenuation features in the approved plan, poor
sealing methods, or defective workmanship are employed, the planning
administrator shall immediately issue a stop work order. Construction shall not
continue until the defects listed by the planning administrator have been
remedied. (Ord. 04-04, 1-6-2004)

   E.   Increased Capacity Capital Improvement; Payback Contract With
Developer:
      1.   Upon approval of an increased capacity capital improvement, the City
may enter into a contract with the developer concerning the construction,
operation, or maintenance of the capital improvement and a payment of increased
capacity fees in an amount not to exceed the allowable recovery cost to the
developer of the increased capacity capital improvement and any interest set
out in capital recovery section.
      2.   After the completion and acceptance by the City of the developer's
capital improvement constructed pursuant to this chapter, and upon connection
of the improvement to the City's infrastructure, said improvement shall
thereupon be and become a part of the City of Enid's capital improvement
system, under the City's exclusive ownership, control and operation, including
the right to make all such connections and cross connections, and use of the
improvement as it may deem necessary for the proper management and utilization

of the capital recovery sums actually paid by others. In the event the fees are
not collected, the City shall not be liable for payment.
      4.   The City shall, during the term of any increased capacity contract,
require any post-improvement developer, within the area of impact, which
desires to connect to or extend any increased capacity improvement or otherwise
use the system, to pay to the City, for the benefit of the developer of the
increased capacity improvement, that portion of the allowable costs, as
calculated herein, for payment to developers which hold increased capacity
capital improvement contracts on that portion of the City's infrastructure
which serves the property to be connected to or use the improvement.
      5.   Neither the contract nor any right contained therein may be sold,
assigned, transferred or encumbered by the developer without the advance
written consent of the City.
      6.   Nothing contained in the language of the contract shall prohibit the
City from making any connections, cross connections or use of the capital
improvement constructed by the developer at any location, and no payment or fee
shall be required.
   F.   Increased Capacity Fee Calculation: The post-improvement development
site's share of an increased capacity capital improvement cost shall be
calculated as follows:
      1.   Basis For Calculation: The allowable recovery cost shall be the cost
of the project minus the developer's cost of share, where:
         a.   Developer's share of the project shall be based on the
developer's share of the increased capacity compared to the total increased
capacity established in the agreement.
         b.   Developer's cost share shall be the developer's share of the
project multiplied by the allowable cost of the project.
      2.   Post-Improvement Development Sites: The post-improvement development
site's increased capacity fee for a qualifying capital improvement shall be
calculated as follows:
         a.   Post-improvement development share shall be based upon the post-
improvement development's share of the increased capacity compared to the total
increased capacity established in the agreement.
         b.   Post-improvement development cost share shall be the post-
improvement development share multiplied by the allowable cost, inflated by
four percent (4%) for each whole year from the date of acceptance of the
capital improvement as a capital recovery project.
   G.   Post-Improvement Development Sites:
      1.   Increased Capacity Fees: When post-improvement development occurs
within the area of impact and makes use of, or receives a benefit of, a portion
of the increased capacity capital improvement covered under this chapter, the
developer of the post-improvement development shall pay the increased capacity
fees set out in this chapter. Fees shall be due and payable to the City before
issuance of the plat, or in cases where there are no plats issued, before
issuance of any permit for the post- improvement development site or
certificate of occupancy. When a post-improvement development occurs outside of
the area of impact, AI, but makes use of and receives fifty percent (50%) or
more of the development's benefit from an increased capacity improvement
covered under this chapter, the developer of the post-development shall pay
increased capacity fees as if the post-development was within the area of
impact.
      2.   Site Requirements: Post-development sites that fall within an
increased capacity capital improvement district or districts, or where fifty
percent (50%) or more of the site will use an improvement, or improvements,
covered by an increased capacity agreement, shall provide the following:
         a.   The share of the increased capacity being accessed or used;
         b.   Payment of increased capacity fee or fees with plat submission,
or with other permits when a plat is not involved.
   H.   Capital Recovery Payments:
      1.   Increased Capacity Fees: The City shall account for the increased
capacity fees for each capital recovery improvement separately. Five percent
(5%) of all fees collected shall be retained by the City for administration.
The City shall provide notice to the developers of record of active capital
improvement districts, of the fees collected in amounts of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or more. Developers of record may then file a claim for payment of
fees, less the City's five percent (5%) administrative fee.
      2.   Unclaimed Fees: Fees not claimed by the developer within one year of
the second notice of fees on file shall become the property of the City, but
failure to collect fees in one year does not terminate the developer's right to
collect in subsequent years.
      3.   Non-Liability Or Obligation Of The City: The City shall not be
liable for payment of any increased capacity fees not collected. The sole
obligation of the City to any developer shall be to require the payment of
increased capacity fees as required by this chapter.
   I.   Term Of Capital Recovery District: Recovery of capital recovery fees is
available for a term of twenty (20) years from the date of acceptance of the
improvements by the City. Provided, however, recovery will be terminated prior
to the term of twenty (20) years if and when the entire allowable recovery cost
has been collected.
   J.   City Use: The City shall have the right to make such connections, use,
changes, improvements, or abandonment of any public improvement, as it may deem
necessary, without payment of fees.
   K.   Special Exception: Prior to payment of capital recovery fees, any
person that can show that they have an interest in property in an area of
impact, AI of a capital improvement project, and that such property is
substantially unique, and that the capital improvement fee is a substantial
hardship due to the unique qualities, may file a request for a special
exception with the City Commission. The Mayor and Board of Commissioners, upon
hearing a request, must determine that there is a substantially unique
condition that makes the proposed capital improvement fee a substantial
hardship on the property before taking any action. The actions that may be
taken include reduction of the capital improvement fee, waiving of the fee,

public services.
   B.   Increased Capacity Fee Calculation For Sanitary Sewers: The post-
improvement development site's share of an increased capacity sanitary sewer
improvement cost shall be calculated as follows:
      1.   Basis For Calculation: The allowable recovery cost shall be
proportioned out based on the post-development site's projected peak hourly
wastewater flow compared to the established design peak hourly wastewater flow,
less the peak hourly wastewater flow established for the original development
site. This calculation shall be made for each improvement district the post-
development site is within.
      2.   Hourly Wastewater Flow Designations: The post-development projected
peak hourly wastewater flow shall be:
         a.   Nine hundred fifty (950) gpd for each single residence;
         b.   Four hundred (400) gpd for each motel unit, hotel, or other

8-3A-5 of this Code, (which requires connection to the City's sewer system),
will not apply to properties within a sanitary sewer capital recovery project
until the recovery of capital recovery fees is terminated. (Ord. 2017-19, 9-19-
2017)
10-4-6: SPECIAL CONDITIONS FOR STORMWATER IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Approval Of Increased Capacity Capital Improvements:
      1.   A developer desiring to make an increased capacity public
improvement for stormwater shall include the following additional information
in their application:
         a.   A detailed drawing of the proposal, indicating the drainage area
to be served (AI), and the proposed location of improvement, drainage report
identifying the existing capacity of the facility and the proposed improved
capacity of the facility.
   B.   Increased Capacity Fee (IFC) Calculation:
      1.   For subdivisions, plats, and site plans:
         a.   The post-improvement development site's increased peak stormwater
discharge shall be determined by the stormwater drainage report prepared by the
developer. The allowable recovery cost adjusted by the time factor shall be
proportioned based upon the post-development site's increase in the peak
stormwater discharge flow compared to the projected total increase in the peak
stormwater discharge for the fully developed drainage area using these
equations:
Post Q - Pre Q = Post-developer increase (PDI)
PDI ÷ projected increase in Q by improvement = Developer's Share (DS)
DS x ARC = ICF
         b.   These calculations shall be made for each drainage area the post-
development site is within.
      2.   For individual lots or tracts of land not covered by subsection B1
of this section, the increased capacity fees will be calculated based upon the
type of development using this equation:
 
ICF = ARC divided by BUA x Lot size x I.
Agricultural and R-1 Estate I = 0.57
Single-Family Residential   I = 0.87
Multi-Family Residential    I = 1.00

(1/2) of the distance to the next existing or planned water line, of equal size
or larger, on both sides of the improvement, but not more than one-half (1/2)
mile from the improvement.
   B.   Increased Capacity Fee Calculation For Water Improvements: The post-
improvement development site's share of an increased capacity water improvement
cost shall be calculated using two (2) methods:
      1.   Half is based upon the area of development, which shall be
determined to be the area of the lot or tract of land associated with any
building and associated with all impervious surface on the site; and,
      2.   Half is based upon the water capacity of the development by using
the following table:
         a.   Meter size shall be the larger of the tap size placed on a water
main or the meter size.
         b.   Water capacity is used to determine the proportional share of the
ARC for this subsection B2.
 
Meter Size Water Capacity
3/4" and smaller 0.56
   1"         1
   1.5"       2.25
   2"         4
   3"         9
   4"         16
   6"         36
 
   C.   Basis For Calculation: The ARC shall be proportioned out based on the
post-development site's area and water tap size. Post- developments shall pay
their proportional share of one-half (1/2) of the allowable recovery cost based
upon the post-development site's developed area compared to the basin area, and
the other half of their payment is their proportional share of one-half (1/2)
of the ARC based on their tap size, in the area, compared to the projected
total metered area established in the basin. In the case where a post-
development site outside the basin boundary ties to or makes use of a capital
recovery improvement, the required increased capacity fee shall be capped at
not more than one-half (1/2) of the ARC, after the inflation multiplier is
applied as required by subsection
10-4-4F2b of this chapter.
   D.   Post-Improvement Development Requirement: At the time of site plan,
platting, permitting or application to connect and in advance of connecting to
the water system, developments within a current area of impact shall provide
its area of development and the water tap size, or sizes. (Ord. 2017-19, 9-19-
2017)
10-4-8: SPECIAL CONDITIONS FOR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS:

Transportation: A developer desiring to make an increased capacity public
transportation improvement shall include the following additional information:
         a.   A traffic study by a professional licensed engineer establishing
ADT, peak hour traffic for both A.M. and P.M., and an equivalent single axle
load (ESAL) for the highest use lane and level of service for existing
conditions, the increased condition with full development of the proposed site
and for the increased condition considering growth for a period of twenty (20)
years from completion of the improvement; and
         b.   When a traffic control signal is included in the improvement, the
traffic study should include the above information for the signaled
intersection and each lane of the intersection. Growth should include the
projected growth of the development with one- half (1/2) mile of the
intersection in all directions or half way to the next traffic light.
   B.   Increased Capacity Fee Calculation For Transportation Improvement: The
post-improvement development site's share of an increased capacity
transportation improvement cost shall be calculated as follows:
      1.   Roads: Post-improvement developments within the area of impact for a
road or multiple roads shall provide as part of the site plan or plat a traffic
study the ESAL generated by the development for the life of the improvement and
the distribution of such loads to the road system. The post-improvement
development's increased capacity fee shall be calculated by multiplying its
ESAL share of the total ESAL for the road by the ARC, after the inflation
multiplier is applied as required by subsection
10-4-4F2b of this chapter.
      2.   Traffic Control Signal: Post-improvement developments within the AI
for a traffic signal shall provide a traffic study showing the distribution of
development generated traffic through the intersection for the life of the
improvement. The post- improvement development increased capacity fee shall be
calculated by multiplying the post-improvement developer's share of traffic
impact on the signal system of the total traffic impact on the signal system by
the ARC, after the inflation multiplier is applied as required by subsection
10-4-4F2b of this chapter.
      3.   Traffic Study Not Required, Fee Calculation: For post- improvement
developments that are not required to provide a traffic study the increased
capacity fee shall be calculated based on the area of the development compared
to the AI. (Ord. 2017-19, 9-19-2017)
10-4-9: CITY AS DEVELOPER:
   A.   The City of Enid or any of its trusts may act as the developer for the
purpose of capital recovery. When the City of Enid acts as the developer, the
following provisions apply:
      1.   Predevelopment Site: No development site is required.
      2.   Allowable Recovery Cost: The allowable cost may be used as the ARC.
      3.   Notice Of Area Of Impact: The City of Enid may file a notice by
resolution in place of a "payback contract" to establish the area of impact,
estimated ARC and any other items necessary and usually covered by the
contract. (Ord. 2017-19, 9-19-2017)

treatment, services, and habilitation in a setting that is least restrictive of
personal liberty. These residential facilities have similar off site impacts
and service demands as do conventional residences for nondisabled persons and
shall be permitted in any residential zoning district subject to density
limitations of other residential uses permitted in each district.
   B.   The purposes of this chapter are:
      1.   To promote the rights of the developmentally disabled to enjoy
adequate habilitative services in the least restrictive community based
setting; and
      2.   To provide the disabled with the patterns and conditions of everyday
living which are as close as possible to the regular circumstances and way of
life of society; and
      3.   To provide a clear and uniform zoning and land use policy for the
establishment of residential facilities for the developmentally disabled. (1994
Code § 25-200)

HABILITATION: Procedures and interventions designed to assist a developmentally
disabled individual achieve greater physical, mental and social development by
enhancing the well-being of the person and teaching skills which increase the
possibility that a resident of a group home will make progressively independent
and responsible decisions about social behavior, quality of life, job
satisfaction and personal relationships. (1994 Code § 25-201)

11-10A-1: GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
The planned unit development is designed to provide for small and large scale
developments incorporating a single type or a variety of residential,
commercial, industrial and related uses, which are planned and developed as a
unit. Such development may consist of individual lots or it may have common
building sites. Common land and preservation of open space should be an
essential and major element of the plan which is related to, and affects the
long term value of, the homes and other development. A planned unit development
shall be a separate entity with a distinct character in harmony with
surrounding development. (Ord. 80-29, 12-16-1980 as amended)
11-10A-2: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
It is the intent of these regulations to encourage unified design of housing,
commercial, office, institutional and industrial areas and facilities or
combinations thereof and to provide for integrated developments having harmony
of design and a variety of functions. The purpose is to provide greater
flexibility in the design of buildings, yards, courts and circulation, than
would otherwise be possible through the strict application of the general
zoning district regulations, and to produce:
   A.   A maximum choice in the types of environment and living units available
to the public;
   B.   Open space and recreation areas;
   C.   A pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding natural
topography and geologic features, and prevents soil erosion;
   D.   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development;
   E.   An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets and thereby lowering housing costs;
   F.   An environment of stable character in harmony with the surrounding
development;
   G.   A more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict
application of other zoning district regulations. (Ord. 80-29, 12-16-1980 as
amended)
11-10A-3: LOCATION:
A PUD shall be permitted in any residential, commercial or industrial zoning
district or combination of districts. (Ord. 80-29, 12-16-1980 as amended)
11-10A-4: DESIGN:
   A.   Development: The proposed PUD shall be designed to provide for the
unified development of the area in accordance with the spirit and the purposes
of the districts in which it is located.
   B.   Modifications: Design may provide for modification of yard, setback and
height requirements on individual lots; but the density and intensity of the
use requirements of the underlying zoning districts as applied to the total
area of the PUD shall not be changed, except in accordance with this article.
   C.   Building Code Requirements: Building code requirements shall not be
reduced in the design of the PUD. (Ord. 80-29, 12-16-1980 as amended)
11-10A-5: EFFECT OF PUD APPROVAL:
   A.   Overlay District: The PUD is an overlay district. The underlying zoning
and land use plan designations on the property shall continue to establish
residential densities, and amount and type of commercial and industrial land
uses. The overlay provision permits these uses and densities to be transferred
or relocated within the PUD in accordance with this article and the approved
master development plan. When a PUD is located within two (2) or more of the
following differing general classifications:
Residential
Office
Commercial
Industrial
each shall be separately calculated and allocated with the PUD by said general
classification.
   B.   Increasing Intensity Of Use Or Density: Where a parcel does not possess
adequate zoning already in place to permit the desired PUD, the property owner
shall include with the PUD request, an application for rezoning to the proper
categories. This may be approved as part of the PUD approval process.
   C.   Time Limit: Construction shall be started within one year of the
effective date of approval of the subdivision final plat for all or a portion
of the PUD. Failure to begin the development within said one year shall
automatically void the development plan within said one year, and the mayor and
board of commissioners may vacate the plat. The developer shall be notified, in
writing, of the expiration of the approval within fifteen (15) days from the
expiration date by the office of the building official. Action shall be taken
by the planning commission and the mayor and board of commissioners to amend
the zoning map to repeal the PUD designation, and the land shall remain in the
same zoning classification which existed immediately preceding the approval of
the PUD.
   D.   Platting Required: No modification of the use, bulk or area
requirements of the applicable underlying use district or districts shall be
permitted unless a subdivision plat incorporating the provisions and
requirements of this article is submitted and approved in accordance with the
subdivision regulations and shall further include such covenants as will
reasonably assure the continued compliance with the approved master development
plan. (Ord. 80-29, 12-16-1980 as amended)
11-10A-6: NUMBER OF PERMITTED DWELLING UNITS:
   A.   Gross Density:
      1.   The maximum number of permitted dwelling units within the PUD shall
not exceed a gross density of six (6) dwelling units per acre on land
designated as low intensity residential on the Enid metropolitan area
comprehensive plan.
      2.   The maximum number of permitted dwelling units/residential intensity
within a PUD on lands designated as medium intensity on the Enid metropolitan
area comprehensive plan shall not exceed a gross density of thirty five (35)
dwelling units per acre.
      3.   Location of housing types and housing density within the PUD,
however, may be reallocated irrespective of the general underlying zoning
district boundaries and shall be dependent upon the design of the approved PUD
master development plan.
   B.   Computation: The low intensity residential density shall not exceed a
maximum number of dwelling units computed as follows:
Maximum # of DUs = gross area of low intensity residential lands within the PUD
x 6 DUs per acre.
   C.   Formula Application: For purposes of computations above, each two (2)
sleeping rooms within residential structures such as, but not limited to,
boarding houses, nursing homes, convalescent homes and elderly housing projects
shall constitute a dwelling unit. Additionally, for purposes of the
computations above, "gross area" shall mean all residentially zoned land
including one-half (1/2) of the right of way of any abutting street. (Ord. 80-
29, 12-16-1980 as amended)
11-10A-7: NONRESIDENTIAL INTENSITY:
   A.   Reallocation, Acreage: The nonresidential areas as designated on the
current Enid metropolitan area comprehensive plan within a PUD may be
reallocated in comparable acreage within the PUD irrespective of the general
zoning district boundaries, if such uses are designed and located to be
compatible with the residential uses of the PUD and the residential use of
adjacent properties. The high intensity industrial areas shall comply with the
area regulations and dimensional standards of the applicable general zoning
district.
   B.   Office And Commercial Areas, Floor Area: The low and medium intensity
office and commercial areas shall not exceed a maximum permitted floor area
computed as follows:
Maximum floor area = gross area of property located within a nonresidential
district x the floor area ratio set forth below in the applicable zoning
district.
 
Zoning District Floor Area Ratio*
C-O             .3
C-1             .3
C-2             .5
C-3             .75
 
*"Floor area ratio" shall mean the gross area of building(s) divided by the lot
area.
   C.   Two Or More Commercial Districts: For the purposes of the above
computations, "gross area" shall mean all commercially zoned land including
one-half (1/2) of the right-of-way of any abutting street. The intensity of use
of a PUD containing two (2) or more commercial zoning districts shall be
separately calculated and allocated within a PUD by said general zoning
district acreage. (Ord. 80-29, 12-16-1980 as amended)
11-10A-8: PRIVATE STREETS AND ALLEYS:
Private streets and alleys may be permitted within a PUD if the following
criteria are met:
   A.   Separation From Adjacent Parcels: The private streets are not connected
with an adjacent parcel which is not a part of the PUD.
   B.   Long Term Maintenance: The owner/applicant shall clearly demonstrate
the existence and capabilities of a property owners' association to provide the
ongoing and long term maintenance of the private street and alley facilities
that will not be provided by the City.
   C.   Compliance With City Standards; Modifications Allowed: The private
streets shall be designed and constructed with the City's standards and
specifications for public streets and alleys; provided, that modifications may
be requested and approved as a part of the master development plan if the
following criteria are met:
      1.   Construction and design shall be adequate to provide a traffic
carrying and utility installation capacity related to the design of the overall
street system, the function of the individual street, and the land use served.
      2.   Paving cross sections shall be designed to be adequate to provide
acceptable drainage in conformity with the drainage plan for the PUD, to
receive loading commensurate with anticipated traffic based on the design of
the overall street system, and to be a maintenance level commensurate with that
of facilities constructed to regular City standards. (Ord. 80-29, 12-16-1980 as
amended)

      1.   It is not the intent of this article to limit new construction to
any one period or architectural style, but to preserve the integrity of
historic and architectural resources and to ensure the compatibility of new
work constructed in the vicinity.
      2.   In the case of the disapproval of plans by the commission, the
commission shall state in writing the reasons for such disapproval and may
include suggestions of the commission in regard to actions the applicant might
take to secure the approval of the commission as to the issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness.
   G.   Archaeological Resources: With regard to the development of a property
containing a designated archaeological resource, a certificate of
appropriateness shall be required prior to the issuance of the permit for which
the applicant has applied; and further, the following requirements shall be
satisfied:
      1.   Archaeological resources shall be protected from inappropriate or
improper digging by demonstration by the applicant that the appropriate permits
and standards are met for study as set by the Oklahoma historical society.
      2.   Any discovered materials shall be properly recorded, reported,
stored or exhibited according to the standards set by the Oklahoma historical
society.

certificate of appropriateness, the applicant or the commission shall cause to
have presented the comments and recommendations of a qualified archaeologist
with respect to the resource under consideration and the application which
would affect it.
   H.   Review By Commission; Criteria:
      1.   The commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness subject
to certain conditions. Work performed pursuant to the issuance of a certificate
of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate, if
any. It shall be the duty of the planning administrator and the code
enforcement department to inspect from time to time any work performed pursuant
to a certificate of appropriateness to assure such compliance.
      2.   In the event that such work is not in compliance, the planning
administrator shall issue a stop work order. The commission may request by
resolution that the planning administrator inspect the work and issue a stop
work order.
      3.   The commission shall be guided by the following review criteria:
         a.   The purpose and intent of this article.
         b.   The degree to which the proposed work may destroy or alter all or
part of a resource.
         c.   The degree to which the proposed work would serve to isolate the
resource from its historic or architectural surroundings, or would introduce
visual, audible, vibratory or polluting elements that are out of character with
the resources and its setting, or that adversely affect the physical integrity
of the resource.
         d.   The compatibility of the building materials with the aesthetic
and structural appearance of the resource, including, but not limited to, the
consideration of texture, style, color or the components and their combinations
of elements such as brick, stone, concrete, shingle, wood or stucco.

economic hardship has been submitted, the commission shall hold a public
hearing at which any person may testify concerning economic hardship.
   D.   Determination Of Economic Hardship: The commission shall review all the
evidence and information required of any applicant for a certificate of
economic hardship and make a determination within forty five (45) days of
receipt of the application, whether the denial of a certificate of
appropriateness has deprived, or will deprive, the owner of the property of
reasonable use of, or economic return on, the property. If the commission
disapproves such a certificate of economic hardship, the applicant shall
proceed with work only when issued a certificate of appropriateness as provided
in section
11-10B-13 of this article. (Ord. 2012-03, 1-19-2012)
11-10B-15: DEMOLITION APPROVAL; PROCEDURE:

      4.   At such public hearing, the mayor and board of commissioners may
enter an order approving the demolition or may enter an order postponing
demolition for an additional period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days
from the date of such order. At the conclusion of this final period of
postponement, the planning administrator shall issue a permit approving the
demolition.
   C.   Criteria For Review Of Demolition: The commission and mayor and board
of commissioners shall be guided by the following criteria in considering
certificates of appropriateness and authorizations for demolition of structures
or sites within the HP historic preservation district:
      1.   The purposes and intent of this article.
      2.   The degree to which the proposed removal of the historic resources
would serve to destroy the integrity and continuity of the historic
preservation district of which it is a part.
      3.   The nature of the resource as a representative type or style of
architecture, socioeconomic development, historic association or other element
of the original designation criteria applicable to such structure or site.

thereof, to a prospective purchaser capable of preserving such structure or
site.
         d.   The potential of such structure or site for renovation and its
potential for continuing use.
         e.   The potential of the subject structure or site for rezoning in an
effort to render such property more compatible with the physical potential of
the structure.
         f.   The ability of the subject structure or site to produce a
reasonable economic return on investment of its owner; provided, however, that
it is specifically intended that this factor shall not have exclusive control
and effect, but shall be considered along with all other criteria contained in
this article. (Ord. 2012-03, 1-19-2012)
11-10B-16: MINIMUM MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Minimum Requirements; File Resolution: Designated landmarks, or
structures, buildings, or monuments within historic preservation districts
shall be maintained to meet the minimum requirements of codes and ordinances
governing the public health, safety and welfare. The commission, on its own
initiative, may file a resolution with the appropriate codes to require
correction of defects or initiation of repairs.
   B.   Repair; Landscaping: All persons in charge of a landmark, or structure,
building or monument within a historic district shall keep in good repair all
of the exterior portions of such resources, including appropriate landscaping.

2012)
11-10B-20: KENWOOD AND WAVERLEY HISTORIC DISTRICTS:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: The Kenwood and Waverley historic district
designations are intended to promote the health, safety, economic, cultural,
and general welfare of the public by encouraging the conservation and
enhancement of the environments specifically in the areas of the city known as
Kenwood Addition and Waverley Addition. The purposes of the district
designations are:
      1.   To safeguard the heritage of the city by preserving a district in
the city which reflects elements of its cultural, social, economic, political,
and architectural history.
      2.   To stabilize and improve property values through protective zoning
and land use policies.
      3.   To foster civic improvement through private property improvement
design guidelines.
   B.   District Designations:
      1.   Boundaries:
         a.   Boundaries of the Kenwood Historic District shall include the
South 1/2 of Blocks 13, 14, 15, and all of Blocks 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 41,
43, Lots 5 through 24, Block 29, and Lot 1, Block 42, inclusive, Kenwood
Addition to the City as shown by the recorded plat thereof, and any replats
which have been filed of record.
         b.   The boundaries of the Waverley Historic District shall include
the South half of Blocks 5 and 6 and all of Blocks 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, Waverley
Addition; the South half of Block 2 and all of Blocks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
Waverley 2nd Addition; the South half of Blocks 3 and 4 and all of Blocks 5, 6,
7, 8, Waverley 3rd Addition; Lots 1 through 8, Block 3, Lots l through 6, Block

Block 7, Lots 1 through 6, Block 8, Waverley 4th Addition to the City, as shown
on the recorded plat thereof, and any replats which have been filed of record.
      2.   Overlay Zoning Districts Established:
         a.   The Kenwood historic district and Waverley historic district
shall each be an overlay zoning district. The underlying zoning on the property
designated by the regular zoning district regulations of this title shall
continue to regulate the use and development of land unless expressly modified
by this article.
         b.   Areas, tracts, or sites within these districts shall henceforth
be identified on the official zoning map and in other official writings by the
attachment of the suffix "HP" for the underlying zoning district
classification.
         c.   Regulations established in this article shall take precedence
over all the regulations in this title whether they are more or less
restrictive.
      3.   Historic Districts: The Kenwood and Waverley historic districts
shall be those areas shown and bounded as such on the official zoning map of
the city of Enid, Oklahoma, entitled "Kenwood Historic District" and "Waverley
Historic District" each of which is incorporated by reference herein as if
fully set out.
   C.   Architectural And Historic Significance Of Each District:
      1.   The city finds and designates the Kenwood historic district due to
its cultural, economic and architectural history.
      2.   In particular, the Kenwood historic district, platted in 1894,
contains some of the finest examples of prairie and Victorian cottage
architectural styles. The district contains certain residential structures
designed by the best architects in the area and which served as homes for
prominent early day citizens. The original architectural and structural
integrity of many of the residences still exists.
      3.   The city finds and designates the Waverley historic district due to
its cultural, economic and architectural history. In particular, the Waverley
historic district, platted in 1902 and 1907, contains fine examples of a
variety of architectural styles including bungalows, colonial revival, medieval
period revival, Spanish, prairie, and neoclassical styles. The district
contains certain residential structures designed by the best architects in the
area and which served as homes for prominent early day citizens. The original
architectural and structural integrity of many residences still exists.
   D.   Regulation Of Structures: No exterior of any structure or site shall be
regulated, erected, moved, demolished, reconstructed, rehabilitated, restored,
stabilized, or altered within the Kenwood and Waverley historic districts
unless such action complies with the requirements of this section.
      1.   Land Use Regulations: The zoning provided in ordinances 86-13 and
86-17 is in accordance with either the current use being made of the property
or the original intended use of the property, whichever is more consistent with
the overall character of the district. The primary use of the Kenwood and
Waverley historic districts is single-family residential and the city shall
strive to preserve and protect this character. In certain instances there may
be structures deteriorated to the extent that they cannot be feasibly used as
originally intended. If adaptive reuse is not allowed in these cases, the only
alternative is "nonuse" which results in increased deterioration or pressure
for demolition. If an owner submits substantial evidence indicating that a last
resort to saving the structure is an alternative use, the historic preservation
commission may recommend to the zoning board of adjustment that a use variance
be granted. A use variance may be permitted when the resulting conversion of
the structure to an alternative use would not compromise the historic, cultural
and/or architectural integrity of the structure or the district. If a use
variance is granted, it shall be for the particular property involved and shall
be for that use only. Should the use discontinue for a period of ninety (90)
days, such discontinuance shall establish a presumption of intent to abandon,
and then the property may only be used in accordance with the zoning of the
property.
      2.   Design Guidelines:
         a.   New Construction: The design guidelines for new construction in
the Kenwood and Waverley historic districts are applicable to the following
types of activity:
            (1)   Types Of Activity:
               (A)   Construction of a new building or auxiliary structure;
               (B)   Any addition to or alteration of an existing structure
which increases the square footage in that structure or otherwise alters its
size, height, contour, or outline;
               (C)   Addition or removal of one or more stories; or
               (D)   Alteration of rooflines.
            (2)   Guidelines For New Construction:
               (A)   Intent; Technical Assistance: These guidelines are not
intended to discourage contemporary design. Imitation and duplication of
architecturally significant details compromises the integrity of both the old
and the new. Nevertheless, the guidelines are adopted in order to integrate new
construction with existing structures in such a way that they harmonize with
the surrounding environment of the historic district. Technical assistance is
available to the public through the city's historic preservation commission
when specific projects are affected by new construction guidelines.
               (B)   Specific Guidelines:
(i) The height of new buildings or additions to existing structures must be no
greater than the cornice height of the highest contributing structure within
the same block on the same side of the street.
(ii) The building setbacks and rhythm of spacing of buildings along the same
side of a street within a block must be maintained when new construction is
proposed.
(iii) The directional expression and sense of entry of buildings along the
street facade must be maintained when new construction is proposed. Further,
garages should be set back behind the house if that is the prevailing pattern
in the area.
(iv) The materials, colors and textures of new construction must be consistent
and compatible with the existing contributing structures within the same block
on the same side of the street.
(v) The scale (the proportion between 2 sets of dimensions) of new construction
must be consistent and compatible with the existing contributing structures
within the same block on the same side of the street.
(vi) New construction within a historic district shall be consistent and
compatible with existing and prevailing elements of contributing structures in
the block with regard to all of the following design elements:
Rhythm of solids and voids on the front facade, which is the rhythm of masses
to openings.
Rhythm and proportion of window and door openings, including the width and
height relationships of windows and doors.
Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections.
Relationship of architectural details, including shutters.
Relationship of ground cover and landscaping, primarily mass and continuity.
Relationship of roof shapes; i.e., gable, hip, or mansard.
Walls of continuity which involves the physical ingredients which form
continuous walls of enclosure along the streets, including walls, facades,
fences, trees, or a combination of these.
               (C)   Waiver: The city understands that some sites may have
their own unique problems and may require special consideration. A strict
interpretation of these guidelines may be waived on a case by case and item by
item basis by the historic preservation commission.
         b.   Rehabilitation: The design guidelines for rehabilitation in the
Kenwood and Waverley historic districts are as follows:
            (1)   Guidelines For Rehabilitation:
               (A)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a
compatible use for a property which requires minimal alteration of the
building, structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
               (B)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a
building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
features should be avoided when possible.
               (C)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized
as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historic basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
               (D)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time
are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site
and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own
right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
               (E)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be
treated with sensitivity.
               (F)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired
rather than replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary,
the new material should match the material being replaced in composition,
design, color, texture, and other visual qualities.
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on
accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
               (G)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken
with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that
will damage the historic building materials shall not be permitted.
               (H)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and
preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
               (I)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to
existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historic, architectural or cultural
material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material,
and character of the property, neighborhood or environment.
               (J)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to
structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations
were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
            (2)   Interpretation: The secretary of the interior has prepared
guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings. The city will use these
guidelines as a reference when interpreting the guidelines listed above.
         c.   Technological Advancements: The design guidelines for
technological advancements relate to certain accessory appurtenances to
development which may compromise the integrity of the Kenwood and Waverley
historic districts. For this reason, the following standards shall be used when
addressing technological advancements that have occurred since the district was
developed. Any technological advancements visible from the street facade
require a certificate of appropriateness prior to installation. Examples of
same technological advancements are as follows:
            (1)   Synthetic Siding:
               (A)   Synthetic clapboard siding may be permitted in the
construction of a new building if the dimensions, colors and textures match
that of the contributing structures on the same block.
               (B)   Synthetic siding may be permitted when proposed for any
addition to, or alteration of, an existing structure if such siding is
consistent with the dimensions, colors and textures of the contributing
structures on the same block.
            (2)   Satellite Dishes: Satellite dishes shall be located in the
rear yard and screened so that they are not visible from any street.
            (3)   Solar Panels And Skylights: Solar panels and skylights are
permitted if they are constructed parallel to, and project no more than eight
inches (8") from, the surface of the roof. Solar panels shall not be visible
from any street.
            (4)   Fences: Walls of continuity (subsection D2a(2)(B)(vi) of this
section under design guidelines for new construction) addresses this concern.
However, it should be emphasized that fence materials should enhance rather
than detract from the property they protect. The commission suggests wrought
iron, picket fencing, or brick walls to add to the historic spirit of the
neighborhood. Chainlink fences are prohibited unless properly screened by
foliage.
            (5)   Window Air Conditioners: Window air conditioners should not
be placed in the front facade. Any remote or exterior mechanical equipment
should be placed behind the front yard setback and be screened so that they are
not visible from any street.
            (6)   Storm Windows And Doors: Storm windows and doors are not
permitted in the construction of a new building. Storm doors and windows may be
permitted on the exterior of existing contributing structures if such doors or
windows are consistent with the original structural design.
      3.   Certificates Of Appropriateness:
         a.   Required; Prerequisite: A certificate of appropriateness is
required in the following instances before the commencement of work upon any
structure or site located within the historic district:
            (1)   Whenever such work requires a building permit issued by the
city. No building permit shall be issued by the building official for any
structure or site located within a historic district until the application for
such permit has been reviewed by the historic preservation commission and a
certificate of appropriateness is approved by the commission.
            (2)   Whenever such work includes the application of paint to
previously unpainted brick or masonry exterior surface or the construction or
enlargement of a driveway or parking area.
            (3)   Whenever such work includes the construction, erection,
moving, demolition, reconstruction, rehabilitation, restoration, stabilization,
or alteration of the exterior of any structure or site, or the installation of
a technological advancement, except when such work satisfies all the
requirements for ordinary maintenance and repair.
         b.   Certificate Of Appropriateness Application Procedure:
            (1)   When applying for such certificate, the applicant must
furnish two (2) copies of all detailed plans, elevations, perspectives and
specifications, and the planning administrator shall forward to the commission
such application for a certificate within five (5) days of receipt thereof. Any
applicant may request a meeting with the commission before submitting an
application and may consult with the commission during the review of the
application.
            (2)   Upon review of the application, the commission will determine
whether the proposed work is of a nature which will adversely affect any
historic or architectural resource and whether such work is appropriate and
consistent with the spirit and intent of the designating ordinance. The
commission will apply the criteria listed below and, based thereon, shall
approve or disapprove the certificate of appropriateness. If the commission
disapproves the certificate of appropriateness, no permit will be issued and
work cannot proceed.
         c.   Certificate Review Procedure: The historic preservation
commission will use the following criteria when reviewing the application. The
commission shall determine whether or not the application complies with:
            (1)   The purpose and intent of the designation ordinance.
            (2)   The degree to which the proposed work may destroy or alter
all or part of a resource.
            (3)   The degree to which the proposed work would serve to isolate
the resource from its historic or architectural surroundings or would introduce
visual, audible, vibratory, or polluting elements that are out of character
with the resource and its setting, or that adversely affect the physical
integrity of the resource.
            (4)   The compatibility of the building materials with the
aesthetic and structural appearance of the resource, including, but not limited
to, the consideration of texture, style, color, or the components and their
combinations of elements such as brick, stone, concrete, shingle, wood, or
stucco.
            (5)   The compatibility of the proposed design to the significant
characteristics of the resource, including, but not limited to, the
consideration of a harmony of materials, details, height, mass, proportion,
rhythm, scale, setback, shape, street, accessories, and workmanship. (Ord.

Notes
1 1. State law reference - 11 OS § 43-101.1.
11-10D-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of these regulations, certain terms and words are to be used
and interpreted as defined below:
ACCIDENT POTENTIAL ZONE (APZ):
APZ I: Is described as being three thousand feet (3,000') wide (1,500 feet to
each side of the runway centerline) and extending outward from the end of the
CZ an additional five thousand feet (5,000'). This zone has a reduced accident
potential.
APZ II: Is described as being three thousand feet (3,000') wide (1,500 feet to
each side of the runway centerline) and extending outward from the end of the
APZ I an additional seven thousand feet (7,000'). This zone has a further
reduced, although still significant, accident potential.
AIRFIELD: Shall refer to Vance air force base, Enid, Oklahoma.
AIRFIELD ENVIRONS OVERLAY DISTRICT: The area within the Vance air force base
vicinity, which is impacted by the combined effects of aircraft noise and
accident potential and therefore, must be protected from the noise and safety
hazards associated with aircraft operations.
AIRSPACE CONTROL SURFACES PLAN: The standards which determine the approach and
departure slopes and imaginary surfaces surrounding Vance AFB. The standards
are specified in part 77.28, 14 CFR (code of federal regulations), chapter 1,
and are hereby adopted by reference.
14 CFR § 77.28 (military airport imaginary surfaces) reads as follows:
(A) Related to airport reference points. These surfaces apply to all military
airports. For the purposes of this section a military airport is any airport
operated by an armed force of the United States.
  (1) Inner horizontal surface. A plane is oval in shape at a height of 150
feet above the established airfield elevation. The plane is constructed by
scribing an arc with a radius of 7,500 feet about the centerline at the end of
each runway and interconnecting these arcs with tangents.
  (2) Conical surface. A surface extending from the periphery of the inner
horizontal surface outward and upward at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal
distance of 7,000 feet to a height of 500 feet above the established airfield
elevation.
  (3) Outer horizontal surface. A plane, located 500 feet above the established
airfield elevation, extending outward from the outer periphery of the conical
surface for a horizontal distance of 30,000 feet.
(B) Related to runways. These surfaces apply to all military airports.
  (1) Primary surface. A surface located on the ground or water longitudinally
centered on each runway with the same length as the runway. The width of the
primary surface for runways is 2,000 feet. However, at established bases where
substantial construction has taken place in accordance with a previous lateral
clearance criteria, the 2,000-foot width may be reduced to the former criteria.
  (2) Clear zone surface. A surface located on the ground or water at each end
of the primary surface, with a length of 1,000 feet and the same width as the
primary surface.
  (3) Approach clearance surface. An inclined plane, symmetrical about the
runway centerline extended, beginning 200 feet beyond each end of the primary
surface at the centerline elevation of the runway end and extending for 50,000
feet. The slope of the approach clearance surface is 50 to 1 along the runway
centerline extended until it reaches an elevation of 500 feet above the
established airport elevation. It then continues horizontally at this elevation
to a point 50,000 feet from the point of beginning. The width of this surface
at the runway end is the same as the primary surface, it flares uniformly, and
the width at 50,000 is 16,000 feet.
  (4) Transitional surfaces. These surfaces connect the primary surfaces, the
first 200 feet of the clear zone surfaces, and the approach clearance surfaces
to the inner horizontal surface, conical surface, outer horizontal surface or
other transitional surfaces. The slope of the transitional surface is 7 to 1
outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline.
CLEAR ZONE (CZ): Two thousand feet (2,000') wide (1,000 feet to each side of
the runway centerline) and extending outward from the end of all active runway
surfaces. The CZ starts at the end of the runway and extends outward three
thousand feet (3,000'). This zone has the highest accident potential.
CLEAR ZONE, ACCIDENT POTENTIAL ZONES AND NOISE ZONES MAP: The official map
adopted by reference with this title, designating clear zones, accident
potential zones and noise zones per March 2003, "Air Installation Compatible
Use Zone (AICUZ) Study".
DECIBEL (dB): The physical unit commonly used to describe noise levels; the
unit of level such as the sound pressure level.
NOISE ZONES (NZ): Areas subject to a degree of exterior noise created by
airfield operations. There are four (4) NZs as follows:
   A.   65<70 dB
   B.   70<75 dB
   C.   75<80 dB
   D.   80+ dB
NONCONFORMING USE: Any structure or use of land which is lawfully in existence
at the time a regulation is prescribed in an ordinance or an amendment thereto
becomes effective.
OVERLAY DISTRICT: A set of zoning requirements that are imposed in addition to
those of the underlying district.
STRUCTURE: An object constructed or installed by man, including, but without
limitation, buildings, towers, smokestacks and overhead transmission lines.
(Ord. 04-01, 1-6-2004)
11-10D-3: AIRFIELD ENVIRONS SUBDISTRICTS:
Within the airfield environs overlay district, there are areas affected
similarly by the combined characteristics of noise, flight tracks, altitude,
and accident potential. These areas are designated as clear zones (CZs),
accident potential zones (APZs) and noise zones (NZs). These areas are
consistent with air force and local community land use guidelines. These areas
are subdistricts within the overlay district. (Ord. 04-01, 1-6-2004)
11-10D-4: CLEAR ZONE (CZ):
This subdistrict is the most severely impacted by the operations of the
adjacent airfield, which possesses a significant risk factor for aircraft
accidents. The placement of structures is not compatible and is therefore
prohibited. CZ also encompasses portions of noise zones Ldn 75<80 and 80+.
Therefore, noise sensitive uses are not compatible without the incorporation of
extensive noise attenuation construction techniques. Exposure to outside noise
could be a health hazard to persons and animals. It is intended that the
principal use of land shall remain for agriculture production of crops and
other miscellaneous agriculture services. Residential uses are not permitted,
unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   A.   District Use Regulations:
      1.   Uses Permitted: Property in CZ shall be utilized only for those uses
permitted in the underlying zoning districts, unless otherwise specified in
table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
      2.   Uses Permitted By Review: Property in CZ shall be utilized only for
those uses permitted by review in the underlying zoning districts, unless
otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   B.   Site Development Standards:
      1.   Standards Of Underlying District: Property shall be developed in
accordance with the development standards of the underlying district.
      2.   Height: Buildings and structures are prohibited, unless otherwise
specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article. No building or structure shall exceed twenty five
feet (25') in height or the maximum height specified by the airspace control
surfaces plan, whichever is less. (Ord. 04-01, 1-6-2004)
11-10D-5: ACCIDENT POTENTIAL ZONE (APZ) I:
This subdistrict is severely impacted by the operations of the nearby airfield.
Due to the number of flight tracks over this subdistrict, a risk factor for
aircraft accidents does exist, although not as great as CZ. APZ I encompasses
portions of noise zones Ldn 65<70, 70<75, 75<80 and 80+. Therefore, noise
sensitive uses are not compatible without the incorporation of extensive noise
attenuation construction. Exposure to outdoor noise could be a health hazard to
persons and animals. It is intended that the primary use of land in this
district remain for agriculture production of crops and other agriculture
services. Residential uses are not compatible with United States air force
(USAF) recommendations and are not permitted, unless otherwise specified in
table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   A.   District Use Regulations:
      1.   Uses Permitted: Property and buildings in APZ I shall be utilized
only for those uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts, unless
otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
      2.   Uses Permitted By Review: Property and buildings in APZ I shall be
utilized only for those uses permitted by review in the underlying zoning
districts, unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   B.   Site Development Standards:
      1.   Standards Of Underlying District: Property shall be developed in
accordance with the development standards of the underlying district.
      2.   Height: No building or structure shall exceed thirty five feet (35')
in height or the maximum height specified by the airspace control surfaces
plan, whichever is less. (Ord. 04-01, 1-6-2004)
11-10D-6: ACCIDENT POTENTIAL ZONE (APZ) II:
This subdistrict is heavily impacted by the operations of the nearby airfield,
which possess a significant risk factor for aircraft accidents. Residential
uses, other than low density single-family dwellings, are not compatible.
Density in this area is restricted to one dwelling unit per acre, and
commercial areas are limited to fifty (50) persons per acre. APZ II encompasses
portions of noise zones Ldn 65<70 and 70<75. Therefore, noise sensitive uses
are not compatible without the incorporation of noise attenuation construction.
Most outdoor uses are only marginally compatible. It is intended that the
principal use of undeveloped lands within the district remain for agriculture
production of crops and other miscellaneous agriculture services until such
time as development is warranted. This subdistrict is also intended to
accommodate the wholesale, light industrial, and retail uses that are permitted
in the underlying zoning districts, which do not concentrate large numbers of
people.
   A.   District Use Regulations:
      1.   Uses Permitted: Property and buildings in APZ II shall be utilized
only for those uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts, unless
otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
      2.   Uses Permitted By Review: Property and buildings in APZ II shall be
utilized only for those uses permitted by review in the underlying zoning
districts, unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   B.   Site Development Standards:
      1.   Standards Of Underlying District: Property shall be developed in
accordance with the development standards of the underlying zoning district.
      2.   Height: No building or structure shall exceed the height specified
in the underlying zoning district, or the maximum height specified by the
airspace control surfaces plan, whichever is less. (Ord. 04-01, 1-6-2004)
11-10D-7: NOISE ZONE (NZ) 65<70 dB:
This subdistrict is moderately impacted by the operations of the nearby
airfield. Noise sensitive uses are not compatible in the NZ 65<70 dB without
the incorporation of noise attenuation construction techniques. NZ 65<70 dB
also encompasses portions of APZ I and APZ II. The district is primarily
developed as low density single-family residential subdivisions and a community
park, with open space and farmland located near the base. Most outdoor uses
would be compatible. It is intended that the uses permitted in the underlying
zoning districts shall be permitted in noise zone 65<70 dB with noise
attenuation required for noise sensitive uses.
   A.   District Use Regulations:
      1.   Uses Permitted: Property and buildings in NZ 65<70 dB shall be
utilized only for those uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts,
unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
      2.   Uses Permitted By Review: Property and buildings in NZ 65<70 dB
shall be utilized only for those uses permitted by review in the underlying
zoning districts, unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   B.   Site Development Standards:
      1.   Standards Of Underlying District: Property shall be developed in
accordance with the development standards of the underlying zoning district.
      2.   Height: No building or structure shall exceed the height specified
in the underlying zoning district, or the maximum height specified by the
airspace control surface plan, whichever is less. (Ord. 04-01, 1-6-2004)
11-10D-8: NOISE ZONE (NZ) 70<75 dB:
This subdistrict is heavily impacted by the operations of the nearby airfield.
Noise sensitive uses are not compatible in the NZ 70<75 dB without the
incorporation of noise attenuation construction techniques. Moreover, most
outdoor uses would remain incompatible. NZ 70<75 dB also encompasses portions
of the APZ I and APZ II. It is intended that the uses permitted in the
underlying zoning districts shall be permitted in NZ 70<75 dB, with noise
attenuation required for noise sensitive uses.
   A.   District Use Regulations:
      1.   Uses Permitted: Property and buildings in NZ 70<75 dB shall be
utilized only for those uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts,
unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
      2.   Uses Permitted By Review: Property and buildings in NZ 70<75 dB
shall be utilized only for those uses permitted by review in the underlying
zoning districts, unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   B.   Site Development Standards:
      1.   Standards Of Underlying District: Property shall be developed in
accordance with the development standards of the underlying zoning district.

11-10D-9: NOISE ZONE (NZ) 75<80 dB:
This subdistrict is severely impacted by the operations of the airfield. Noise
sensitive uses are not compatible without the incorporation of noise
attenuation construction techniques. NZ 75<80 dB encompasses portions of APZ I
and the clear zone. Most outdoor uses would not be compatible.
   A.   District Use Regulations:
      1.   Uses Permitted: Property and buildings in NZ 75<80 dB shall be
utilized only for those uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts,
unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
      2.   Uses Permitted By Review: Property and buildings in NZ 75<80 dB
shall be utilized only for those uses permitted by review in the underlying
zoning districts, unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   B.   Site Development Standards:
      1.   Standards Of Underlying District: Property shall be developed in
accordance with the development standards of the underlying zoning district.
      2.   Height: No building or structure shall exceed thirty five feet (35')
in height or the maximum height specified by the airspace control surfaces
plan, whichever is less. (Ord. 04-01, 1-6-2004)
11-10D-10: NOISE ZONE (NZ) 80+ dB:
This subdistrict is the most severely impacted by the operations of the
adjacent airfield. Noise sensitive uses are not compatible without the
incorporation of extensive noise attenuation construction techniques. NZ 80+
also encompasses portions of the clear zone, and APZ I. Exposure to outside
noise could be a health hazard to persons and animals. It is intended that the
principal use of land shall remain for agriculture production of crops and
other miscellaneous agriculture services. Residential uses are not permitted
unless otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   A.   District Use Regulations:
      1.   Uses Permitted: Property in NZ 80+ shall be utilized only for those
uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts, unless otherwise specified
in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
      2.   Uses Permitted By Review: Property in NZ 80+ shall be utilized only
for those uses permitted by review in the underlying zoning districts, unless
otherwise specified in table 1, section
11-10D-13 of this article.
   B.   Site Development Standards:
      1.   Standards Of Underlying District: Property shall be developed in
accordance with the development standards of the underlying district.
      2.   Height: Buildings and structures are prohibited, unless otherwise
specified in section

twenty five feet (25') in height or the maximum height specified by the
airspace control surfaces plan, whichever is less. (Ord. 04-01, 1-6-2004)
11-10D-11: CERTAIN LAND USES PROHIBITED:
Within the boundaries of the airfield environs overlay district, there are
particular land uses, which are considered airfield hazards and therefore,
shall be prohibited:
   A.   Uses which release into the air any substance such as, but not limited
to, steam, dust, smoke, fumes or gases, unless such substance is generated from
agricultural use, which would impair visibility or otherwise interfere with
military operations including ground operations.
   B.   Uses which produce light emissions, either direct or indirect
(reflective), which would interfere with pilot vision and aerial or ground
based night vision training.
   C.   Uses which produce electrical emissions which would interfere with
military ground and aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
   D.   Uses which attract birds or waterfowl, such as, but not limited to,
operation of sanitary landfills, and maintenance of feeding stations.
   E.   Uses which endanger the approach, departure, or maneuvering of aircraft
by providing structures within ten feet (10') of a defined aircraft approach,
departure or transitional surfaces or one hundred feet (100') beneath a low
level military training route.
   F.   Uses which detract from the aesthetic appearance or otherwise create or
promote an unsightly, unsanitary, or unhealthy appearance of any entrance into
a military installation, including, but not limited to, automobile or truck
salvage yards, equipment storage sites or solid waste or disposal sites. (Ord.
2006-27, 12-5-2006)
11-10D-12: NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   Continuance: A nonconforming use lawfully existing at the time this
section became effective may be continued except as provided otherwise.
   B.   Discontinuation: If a nonconforming use of any building, structure or
land is discontinued or its normal operation stops for a period of five (5)
years, the use shall thereafter conform to a use permitted in conformance with
these regulations. For purposes of this section, a "building" is defined as a
structure with a common roof and may include more than one business or use,
that are contiguous or adjoining, such as Oakwood Mall, Neilson Square or
Sunset Plaza.
   C.   Destruction By Calamity: Any nonconforming use which has been damaged
or destroyed by fire or other causes may be repaired or rebuilt to its original
condition without regard to these regulations; provided, however, noise
attenuation construction shall be required if specified in section
11-10D-13, table 1, of this article.
   D.   Expansion Or Enlargement: A nonconforming use may not be expanded,
increased, enlarged or extended. However, the size or square feet of a
nonconforming building or structure, that is nonconforming due to the
concentration of persons (density), may be increased if by doing so the density
of the use is decreased by twenty five percent (25%).
   E.   Single-Family Dwellings Permitted: Any lot or tract of record or
combination of lots of record existing as of the effective date hereof may be
utilized for the placement of a single-family dwelling, if so permitted in the
underlying zoning district; provided, however, noise attenuation construction
shall be required.
   F.   Change Of Use: A nonconforming use of a building or structure or land
may be changed to an equal or less objectionable use within or outside of the
same classification. Once changed, the nonconforming use may not revert back to
the original use. For purposes of this section, less objectionable uses will
primarily refer to uses that result in a less dense concentration of persons.
(Ord. 2008-17, 8-19-2008)
11-10D-13: TABLES; LAND USE COMPATIBILITY:
Table 1 of this section specifies those land uses which are not permitted
within the airfield environs overlay district, as well as those uses which may
be permitted if certain conditions are met such as low density or noise
attenuation as long as the uses are permitted in the underlying zoning
district. Table 2 of this section provides an alternative method of determining
the compatibility of land uses, but does not address noise attenuation. On
density issues, either chart can be used to determine whether the use is
allowed. If either one of the charts would permit the use, the use is allowed.
On noise attenuation issues, table 1 of this section must be used. These tables
must be used in conjunction with the underlying zoning to ensure a use is
permitted.

Legend:
SLUCM:   "Standard Land Use Coding Manual", U.S. department of transportation.
Y:       Yes - land uses and related structures are compatible without
restriction.
N:       No - land use and related structures are not compatible and are
prohibited.
Y*:      See asterisk (*) at the end of note 2 of this table.
Yx:      Yes with restrictions - land use and related structures generally
compatible; see notes indicated by the superscript.
Nx:      No with exceptions - see notes indicated by the superscript.
NLR:      Noise level reduction (outdoor to indoor) to be achieved through
incorporation of noise attenuation measures into the design and construction of
the structures.
DNL:      Day/night average sound level.
A, B or C:   Land use and related structures are compatible; measures to
achieve NLR for A (DNL/65<70), B (DNL/70<75), C (DNL/75<80), need to be
incorporated into the design and construction of structures.
A*, B* and C*:   Land use and related structures are compatible with NLR.
However, measures to achieve an overall noise level reduction do not
necessarily solve noise difficulties and additional evaluation is warranted.
See appropriate footnotes.
Notes:
      1.      Maximum density is 1 dwelling unit per acre possibly increased
under a planned unit development where maximum lot coverage is less than 20
percent.
2.   Shopping malls and shopping centers are considered incompatible uses in
any accident potential zone (CZ, APZ I or APZ II). Uses are compatible if they
do not result in a gathering of individuals in an area that would result in an
average density of greater than 25 persons per hour during a 24 hour period,
not to exceed 50 persons per acre at any given time. Uses are compatible if
they do not result in a gathering of individuals in an area that would result
in an average density of greater than 25 persons per acre per hour during a 24
hour period, not to exceed 50 persons per acre at any time. Average densities
of persons per hour during a 24 hour period are determined by calculating the
number of persons per acre expected on a site, multiplying by the number of
hours they will be on the site, and dividing the total by 24. (For example: One
8-hour shift of 30 workers on a 1 acre site. Average density = 30 persons
expected x 8 hours on site = 240, then 240/24 = 10; thus average density per
acre per hour per a 24 hour period. Another example is two 8-hour shifts of 30
workers on a 1 acre site. Average density = 30 persons expected x 16 hours on
site = 480. Then 480/24 = 20; thus the average density = 20 persons per acre
per hour per a 24 hour period.) The maximum number of persons allowed per acre
per hour is calculated by dividing the number of hours persons will be on site
by 24 hours, and then dividing 25 persons per acre per hour by the result. The
resulting number is the maximum number of persons allowed per acre per hour,
provided it does not exceed 50. 50 persons per acre at any one time is the
maximum number of persons allowed under the standard. (For example: The maximum
density for two 8-hour shifts on a 1 acre site. 25 divided by 16/24 = 37.5
persons per acre per hour allowed.) Application of this formula results in the
following table which specifies the maximum persons per acre per hour for the
duration of the time that persons are expected to be on site during a 24 hour
period.

Note: Fractions in the maximum persons allowed column are rounded to the lowest
whole number.
*Concentration of people may not exceed 50 people per acre at any time, or 50
people on any 1 acre regardless of lot size. Additional acreage cannot be
aggregated to permit a higher concentration of people on any 1 site. The method
for calculating the number of people in a structure shall be in accordance with
chapter 10 of the international building code, which details the floor area in
square feet per occupant. However, buildings should be limited to 1 story and
the lot coverage shall not exceed 20 percent.
      3.      The placement of structures, buildings or aboveground utility
lines in the CZ are prohibited.
      4.   No passenger terminals and no major aboveground transmission lines
in APZ I.
      5.   Factors to be considered: labor intensity, structural coverage,
explosive characteristics, and air pollution.
      6.   Low density office uses only. Meeting places, auditoriums, etc., are
prohibited.
      7.   Excludes chapels.
      8.   Facilities must be low density.
      9.   Clubhouses are prohibited.
      10.   Areas for gatherings of people are prohibited.
      11.   Residential uses are permitted through a use by review so long as
they incorporate measures to achieve outdoor to indoor NLR for DNL 65<70 dB and
DNL 70<75 dB into construction of the residence, consistent with the
"Guidelines For The Sound Insulation Of Residences Exposed To Aircraft
Operation", Wyle research report WR 89-7, which document is hereby incorporated
by this reference. Residential uses that do not incorporate these measures are
prohibited in the airfield environs overlay district. NLR criteria will not
eliminate outdoor noise problems. However, building location and site planning
and design and use of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor exposure,
particularly from near ground level sources. Measures that reduce outdoor noise
should be used whenever practical in preference to measures which only protect
interior spaces.
      12.   Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in the
DNL 65<70 dB range must be incorporated into the design and construction of
portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise
sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.
      13.   Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in the
DNL 70<75 dB range must be incorporated into the design and construction of
portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise
sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.
      14.   Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in the
DNL 75<80 dB range must be incorporated into the design and construction of
portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise
sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.
      15.   If noise sensitive, use indicated NLR; if not, the use is
compatible.
      16.   No buildings.
      17.   Land use is compatible, provided special sound reinforcement
systems are installed.
      18.   Residential buildings required the same NLR as required for
facilities in the DNL 65<70 dB range.
      19.   Residential buildings required the same NLR as required for
facilities in the DNL 70<75 dB range.
      20.   Residential buildings are prohibited.
      21.   Land use is prohibited for cemeteries and forestry activities. Land
use is compatible for agriculture (except for livestock).

Legend:
SLUCM:   "Standard Land Use Coding Manual", U.S. department of transportation.
Y:         Yes - land use and related structures are compatible without
restriction.
N:         No - land use and related structures are not compatible and are
prohibited.
Yx:      Yes with restrictions - land use and related structures are generally
compatible. However, see notes indicated by the superscript.
Nx:      No with exceptions - land use and related structures are generally
incompatible. However, see notes indicated by the superscript.
FAR:      Floor area ratio - it is used to measure nonresidential intensities
or densities.
A floor area ratio is the difference between the size of the building and the
site area measured in square feet. The site area is measured to the property
line to include the center of adjacent streets or alleyways, but does not
include the area utilized by separate buildings.
For multiple tenants in a building, the following equations should be used to
determine the floor area ratio for a particular tenant:
The floor area of a tenant (T) is divided by the combined leasable space of the
building plus the tenant's proportionate share of the common space (B)
multiplied by the site area, which equals the individual tenant's proportioned
site area (ITPSA). (T divided by B multiplied by site area = ITPSA.)
Then, the floor area of the tenant is divided by the ITPSA, which equals the
floor area ratio of a tenant. (T divided by ITPSA = FAR.)
Du/Ac:      Dwelling units per acre - this metric is customarily used to
measure residential densities.
Notes:
1.      A "yes" or a "no" designation for compatible land use is to be used
only for general comparison. Within each, uses exist where further evaluation
may be needed in each category as to whether it is clearly compatible, normally
compatible, or not compatible due to the variation of densities of people and
structures. Floor area ratios are provided as a guide to density in some
categories. In general, land use restrictions which limit commercial, services,
or industrial buildings or structure occupants to 25 per acre in APZ I, and 50
per acre in APZ II are the range of occupancy levels considered to be low
density. Outside events should normally be limited to assemblies of not more
than 25 people per acre in APZ I, and maximum assemblies of 50 people per acre
in APZ II.
2.      The maximum density for detached single-family housing is 1 to 2
dwelling  units per acre. In a planned unit development (PUD) of single-family
detached units where clustered housing development results in large open areas,
this density could be increased, provided the amount of surface area covered by
structures does not exceed 20 percent of the PUD total area. PUD encourages
clustered development that leaves large open areas.
3.      Other factors to be considered: labor intensity, structural coverage,
explosive characteristics, air pollution, electronic interference with
aircraft, height of structures, and potential glare to pilots.
4.      No structures (except airfield lighting), buildings or aboveground
utility/communications lines should be located in clear zone areas on or off
the installation. The clear zone is subject to severe restrictions. See NAVFAC
P-80.3 or Tri-Service manual AFM 32-1123(I); TM 5-803-7, NAVFAC P-971,
"Airfield And Heliport Planning And Design", dated May 1, 1999, for specific
design details.
5.      No passenger terminals and no major aboveground transmission lines in
APZ I.
6.      Low intensity office uses only. Accessory uses such as meeting places,
auditoriums, etc., are not allowed.
7.      No chapels are allowed within APZ I or APZ II.
8.      Facilities must be low intensity. Facilities such as clubhouses,
meeting places, auditoriums, large classes, are not allowed.
9.      Includes livestock grazing but excludes feedlots and intensive animal
husbandry. Activities that attract concentrations of birds that create a hazard
to aircraft operations are excluded.
10.   Includes feedlots and intensive animal husbandry.
11.   Lumber and timber products removed due to establishment, expansion, or
maintenance of clear zones will be disposed of in accordance with appropriate
DoD natural resources instructions.
12.   Controlled hunting and fishing may be permitted for the purpose of
wildlife management.
13.   Naturally occurring water features (e.g., rivers, lakes, streams,
wetlands) are compatible.

and building forms that are consistent with the city's land use policies. The
district can also be used to minimize hardships resulting from the application
of other land use regulations, such as the AED airfield environs overlay zoning
regulations. This article further encourages the redevelopment of existing
shopping centers, big box retail sites, and other sites characterized by large
expanses of surface parking into a development pattern which is pedestrian
friendly, compatible with surrounding development, provides a visually
attractive site design, and which reduces reliance on the automobile for
vehicular trips. The city will not approve a rezoning to CIO unless the
applicant transfers development rights pursuant to this article. (Ord. 04-02,

development plan. Requirements may be made for off site public improvements on
a phased project.
      4.   Public Hearing And Planning Commission Action: The planning
administrator, upon filing of an application for the supplemental district
designation CIO shall set the matter for public hearing in accordance with the
regular procedures for zoning applications. Within sixty (60) days after the
filing of an application, the planning commission shall conduct the public
hearing and shall determine:
         a.   Whether the CIO is consistent with the comprehensive plan;
         b.   Whether the CIO harmonizes with the existing and expected
development of surrounding areas;
         c.   Whether the CIO is a unified treatment of the development
possibilities of the project site;
         d.   Whether the CIO is consistent with the stated purposes of the
standards of this article. The planning commission shall forward its
recommendations, the application, and the master development plan to the mayor
and board of commissioners for further hearing.
      5.   Mayor And Board Of Commissioners Action: Upon receipt of the
application, master development plan, and planning commission recommendation,
the mayor and board of commissioners shall hold a hearing, review the master
development plan and approve, disapprove, modify or return the master
development plan to the planning commission for further consideration. Upon
approval, the zoning map shall be amended to reflect the supplemental
designation CIO, and the applicant shall be authorized to process a preliminary
plat and preliminary site development plan incorporating the provisions of the
master development plan.

11-11-15: Variance
11-11-1: PURPOSE:
By reason of potential adverse effect on public services, community appearance,
environment, welfare, and to neighboring land uses, site plan review and
approval shall be required for development. For the purpose of assuring proper
accessibility, circulation, functional relationships of uses, and compatibility
with adjoining and nearby development, no building or occupancy permit shall be
issued, nor use commenced, except in accordance with a site plan submitted and
approved by the city. (Ord. 80-29, 12-16-1980, as amended)
11-11-2: INTENT:
The site plan review process recognizes that the developments to which it is
made applicable, even though generally suitable for location in a particular
district or on a particular site, are, because of their nature, size,
complexity, or other indicators of probable impact, capable of adversely
affecting the purposes for which the regulations of this title are established,
unless careful consideration has been given to critical design elements.
Therefore, it is the intent of this process to ensure that all elements are
reviewed for compatibility with the provisions of this title. A site plan, much
like a preliminary plat of subdivision, is intended to serve as a working
document for the developer and the city. It shall provide sufficiently detailed
information to allow an informed decision concerning the overall acceptability
of the proposed development. (Ord. 80-29, 12-16-1980, as amended)
11-11-3: APPLICABILITY:
Site plan review shall be required, as a precondition to the issuance of a
building or occupancy permit, in the following instances:
   A.   Residential Uses: The development or establishment of any residential
land use consisting of more than one residential structure containing three (3)
or more dwelling units.
   B.   Commercial Or Public Uses: The development or establishment of any
commercial or public use.
   C.   Convalescent Or Group Homes: The initial establishment or development
of any convalescent, rest or nursing home; group home; rooming or boarding
house that will house more than ten (10) residents excluding staff. (Ord. 80-
29, 12-16-1980, as amended)
11-11-4: EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Enumeration: This chapter shall not apply to:
      1.   Permitted uses in A agricultural districts nor for their related
accessory uses and structures.
      2.   Proposed development or redevelopment in any I-1, I-2, or I-
3 industrial zoning district not abutting an arterial.
      3.   One- or two-family subdivisions or an individual three- or four-
family dwelling.
      4.   New occupancies or existing structures in the C-4 central business
district zone.
      5.   Planned unit developments, mobile home parks, and planned industrial
parks, which shall be developed in accordance with the site plan requirements
of the PUD regulations, the R-6 mobile home regulations, and the I-1 planned
industrial development plan regulations.
      6.   Additions or enlargements of existing individual dwellings, unless
the total number of units exceeds four (4) within a residential structure.
      7.   Additions to existing nonresidential buildings or uses when such
addition does not exceed five thousand (5,000) square feet or one-third (1/3)
of the gross floor area of the existing building or use.
      8.   Any use permitted on a temporary basis for a period not to exceed
six (6) months. (Ord. 2013-38, 9-17-2013)
11-11-5: DESIGN STANDARDS:
The following design standards shall apply to any development requiring site
plan review:
   A.   Access: All developments requiring site plan review shall have adequate
and safe vehicular access to adjacent streets. All entrance and exit driveways
to public streets shall be located with due consideration for traffic flow so
as to afford minimum conflict to traffic on public streets. All such entrances
and exits shall be so located and designed so as to comply with the traffic
control policies of the city and in the case of state highways, they shall
comply with the Oklahoma state highway commission's "Driveway Regulations For
Oklahoma Highways".
   B.   Drainage: Proper surface drainage shall be provided so that removal of
surface waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties or the public
storm drainage system and will, so far as practicable, avoid flooding, erosion,
and detrimental depositing of silt, gravel or stone. Surface water shall be
removed from all roofs, canopies and paved areas and disposed of in an
appropriate drainage system. Surface water in all paved areas shall be disposed
of in a manner approved by the city engineer.
   C.   Landscaping: Landscaping shall be included as an integral part of the
development to provide a quality of life and amenities in keeping with the
natural physical surroundings of the city. All developments shall be landscaped
with trees, ornamental shrubs and green areas according to the following
standards:
      1.   Not less than five percent (5%) of the total land area of the
development shall be landscaped with trees, ornamental shrubs, walkways, and
green areas. At least seventy five percent (75%) of this area shall be in the
front or side yards.
      2.   All site plans shall include a detailed landscaping plan indicating
the type and number of plants to be provided.
      3.   Artificial grass or any form of synthetic plant shall not be
permitted as landscaping.
      4.   The use of gravel as ground cover shall not be considered as meeting
the minimum requirements of this section.
      5.   The plan shall especially respect sight triangles at intersections
and be approved for all elements relating to traffic control.
      6.   A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until landscaping has
been installed in accordance with the approved site plan. If the season of the
year will not permit planting, a temporary certificate of occupancy shall be
issued until growing season. Failure to plant landscaping shall be a violation
of this title.
      7.   All landscaping improvements shall be maintained in a live and
healthy manner.
      8.   The planning commission and mayor and board of commissioners may
require that existing landscaping and vegetation on the site be retained in
order to satisfy the requirements of this section.
   D.   Lighting: All lighting in parking areas, as part of signs and
advertising or special lighting, shall be so arranged to avoid unreasonable
reflection, glare, or radiation onto operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians,
and neighboring land uses or properties. Outdoor lighting, when provided, shall
have an arrangement of reflectors and an intensity which will not interfere
with adjacent land uses or the use of adjacent streets. In particular, no
flickering, moving or flashing lights shall be permitted.
   E.   Parking: The location, width and layout of interior drives shall be
appropriate for the proposed interior circulation. The location and layout of
accessory off street parking and loading spaces shall provide for efficient
circulation and the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. The location of parking
areas shall not detract from the design of proposed buildings and structures or
from the appearance of the existing neighboring buildings, structures and
landscape. Provisions shall be made for access by police, fire and emergency
vehicles.
      1.   Landscaping: All parking lots containing more than ten (10) spaces
must have a minimum five foot (5') landscaped strip adjacent to their
perimeters with shade trees planted in the amount equivalent to one shade tree
for every thirty five feet (35') of the perimeter linear footage. On parking
lot perimeters adjacent to residentially zoned or developed land, the
landscaped strip shall contain seventy five percent (75%) opaque screening
which shall include a solid wall, fence or compact evergreen hedge not less
than five feet (5') in height. In addition, unenclosed parking lots with more
than twenty (20) spaces shall have a minimum of two percent (2%) of the
interior surface area landscaped and shall have a permanent underground
watering system. The interior landscaping shall be in planting islands at aisle
ends or strips between aisles. Where planting will be susceptible to injury by
pedestrians or motor traffic, they shall be protected by appropriate curbs,
tree guards, or other devices. Parking lot landscaping as required herein shall
be considered as a part of the five percent (5%) landscaping requirements
specified in subsection C1 of this section.
      2.   Surfacing: All property used for parking of vehicles, storage and
display of merchandise, and all driveways used for vehicle ingress and egress
shall be paved with a permanent hard surface.
   F.   Relation Of Proposed Structures To Environment:
      1.   Proposed structures on the site shall be related in style and design
and shall also relate visually to the terrain and existing buildings and roads
in the vicinity. The achievement of such harmonious relationship may include
the enclosure of space in conjunction with other existing buildings or other
proposed buildings and the creation of focal points with respect to avenues of
approach, terrain features or other buildings. Proposed structures shall be so
sited as to minimize any adverse impact upon the surrounding area, and
particularly upon nearby residences, by reason of:
         a.   Building location, height, bulk and shadows;
         b.   Location, intensity, direction and time usage of outdoor
lighting;
         c.   Likelihood of nuisances;
         d.   Other similar considerations.
      2.   Appropriate screening shall be required to minimize any such adverse
impact.
   G.   Screening: Development and maintenance of planting, fences, and walls
shall be provided as an aesthetic barrier against traffic, noise, heat, glare,
and dust for the protection and conservation of property. Whenever any lot
located in any commercial zone is to be developed or occupied by commercial
uses and it abuts a lot located in any residential zone or a lot developed
residentially and whenever any residential lot is to be developed at a density
three (3) times greater than the density permitted on adjacent property, the
lot shall be screened by, and developed with, a minimum seventy five percent
(75%) opaque barrier not less than five feet (5') in height along the entire
abutting lot line. Said screening or barrier shall be dense landscaping,
earthen berm, solid lumber or masonry fence, wall, or combination thereof.
Solid lumber fencing shall be treated or painted in earth tone colors. More
extensive screening may be required by the planning commission and mayor and
board of commissioners in instances where the above described screening does
not adequately protect adjacent properties from unsightly or distractive
activity and more extensive screening is required to improve compatibility. The
screening as shown on the approved site plan shall be maintained in good
condition. Prescribed fences, walls or dense landscaping need not be provided
along a lot line if a building, fence, wall or dense landscaping of at least
equivalent height, opacity, and maintenance exists immediately abutting on the
opposite side of said lot line. In addition, the planning commission and mayor
and board of commissioners may require that existing landscaping and vegetation
on the site which serves as partial or full screening be retained in order to
satisfy the requirements of this section.
   H.   Special Features: Outside storage areas, service and machinery
installations, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings, and
structures, and similar accessory areas and structures shall be subject to such
setbacks, screen plantings or other screening methods as shall reasonably be
required to prevent any adverse effect upon the environment or nearby property.
   I.   Waste Disposal: All containers for the disposal of wastes shall be
located on a concrete pad and shall be screened to the extent that the
container cannot be viewed by the public, except that location and screening
shall permit ready accessibility as required by title 8, chapter 4 of this
code.
   J.   Public Rights Of Way, Streets And Easements: Each site plan shall
provide for the appropriate dedication and improvement of needed rights of way
and easements as are necessary to adequately serve the proposed development and
occupancy, comply with the minimum requirements of the metropolitan area
transportation plan and the minimum design standards of the city. (Ord. 80-29,
12-16-1980, as amended)
11-11-6: PREAPPLICATION REVIEW:
Prior to submission of a site plan, the applicant should discuss with the
director of community development the procedure and the requirements for the
general layout of the site, utilities, access to arterials, general design and
narrative, the availability of existing services, and similar matters. The
director shall also advise the applicant, where appropriate, to discuss the
proposed development with those officials who must eventually approve the
various aspects of the proposal. The intent of the preapplication review is to

   A.   Purpose: Standards are herein provided for the purpose of extending
land use regulations to the erection, construction, placement, replacement,
display, location, and maintenance of signs and outdoor advertising media for
the purpose of encouraging sound signing practices and lessening the
objectionable effects of competitive signing.
   B.   Objectives: The objectives (intent) of this chapter shall be:
      1.   To enhance the aesthetic quality of life for the citizens of the
City by promoting the reasonable, orderly, and effective display of signs.
      2.   To prohibit signs and billboards which create blight on the
community, reducing the value and desirability of surrounding property,
inhibiting economic development by creating a negative visual image of the
City.
      3.   To preserve and protect private and public property values and civic
beauty and prohibit signs and billboards which detract from this objective due
to excessive size, height, number, or visual impact, or undesirable location,
maintenance, mobility, spacing or illumination.
      4.   To establish standards which will permit businesses a reasonable and
equitable opportunity to advertise, but which will avoid excessive competition
and clutter among sign displays.
      5.   To increase the safety of the citizens in that unregulated
advertising signs compete with official traffic signs for drivers' attention
and thereby decrease the effectiveness of cautionary directional messages
essential for the traveling public.
      6.   To protect the general public from damage and injury which may be
caused by the faulty and uncontrolled construction and use of signs within the
City.
      7.   To provide for special regulations in areas which by nature or
location are unique to other areas of the City.
      8.   To promote the general welfare of the City and its citizens by
preserving the cultural and business significance and architecture of the
Downtown Development District of the City, by strengthening the visual identity
of such district and to promote economic growth by encouraging a central and
unique environment for marketing purposes.
      9.   To provide for the preservation and enhancement of the Historic
Preservation District and to further the national interest as it pertains to
the preservation and enhancement of historic places.
      10.   To provide for an equitable mechanism whereby those signs which are
nonconforming to this chapter can be removed.
      11.   To effectively use the City's police power in determining that the
community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean,
and well balanced as well as carefully patrolled.
      12.   To prohibit billboards/off premises signs within the corporate
limits of the City of Enid but allow for the upgrading of existing billboards
with new technology.
      13.   To promote and maintain the visual attractiveness for residents and
visitors, as well as for commercial, industrial and professional businesses and
other establishments, while maintaining economic stability. (Ord. 2019-02, 3-5-

may be permitted for any individual property shall be two (2) square feet of
sign area for each linear foot of street frontage or store frontage, whichever
is greater, up to two hundred (200) linear feet.
         b.   If the frontage exceeds two hundred (200) linear feet, then for
each additional fifty feet (50') of frontage the business will be allowed an
additional ten (10) square feet of signage.
            (1)   Example: Business has five hundred (500) linear feet of
street frontage, minus the calculated two hundred (200) linear feet of street
frontage. The business has an additional three hundred (300) linear feet of
frontage, divided by fifty (50) which equals six (6). Then multiply six (6)
times ten (10) to get an additional sixty (60) square feet of signage allowed
for that business. The total sign area allowed is four hundred sixty (460)
square feet.
         c.   All computations shall be measured in conformance with the
following regulations:
            (1)   In computing the area of a sign, standard mathematical

allowed an additional ten (10) square feet signage for each fifty (50) linear
feet of frontage they have.
         b.   Signs shall be allowed for each tenant not to exceed two (2)
square feet of sign area for each linear foot of store frontage occupied. Each
tenant shall be allowed a minimum of fifteen (15) square feet of sign area and
a maximum of two hundred (200) square feet of sign area. If a tenant occupies a
corner space, the sign area allowed shall apply to each store frontage. Window
signage will not be calculated into the total allowable signage.
            (1)   In cases where a tenant's store frontage is on the interior
of a building and that tenant has no external public entrance the interior
store frontage will be used to calculate signage.
         c.   A-frame signs will be allowed in the shopping center area as long
as they are along the pedestrian walkway on the interior of the shopping center
and not near parking spaces, roadways or byways, but shall not be left outdoors
except during business hours. These signs may not inhibit the flow of

CHAPTER 15
TRANSFER OF DENSITY/INTENSITY OR DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS
SECTION:
11-15-1: General Description
11-15-2: Sending Areas Created
11-15-3: Receiving Areas Designated
11-15-4: Notice And Hearing Requirements
11-15-1: GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
It is the policy of the city that landowners subject to development
restrictions in the sending areas should be provided regulatory incentives to
permanently restrict such lands from urbanization. 11 Oklahoma Statutes section
43-101 et seq., authorizes the city to control the density of population
through zoning. While such regulations may be legally imposed where they
further a legitimate public purpose and are reasonable, the transfer of
development rights provides a vehicle to enable the private market to allocate
economic benefits to landowners in the restricted areas, thereby enhancing the
viability of businesses in the sending areas and avoiding potential legal
disputes between the private landowners and the city. This chapter establishes
procedures for transferring densities from sending to receiving parcels.
The transfer of density/intensity or development rights (TDR) system is based
on the carrying capacity. In other words, a finite amount of development is
permitted in the areas within the sending and receiving zones. The city is
indifferent as to who does the development. Instead, it lets the market decide
the price. Accordingly, the accumulation of transfer rights is related to the
overall purpose of preserving resources in the area. (Ord. 04-02, 1-6-2004)
11-15-2: SENDING AREAS CREATED:
   A.   Severable development rights are hereby created in the sending areas
designated below.
   B.   All sending areas are assigned development rights at the following
ratios:
 
Sending Area                             Development Rights That May Be
                                         Transferred
Clear zone, APZ I and APZ II of the      1 dwelling unit per gross acre and/or
airfield environs overlay district (AED) 0.15 floor area ratio
 
For purposes of this subsection, "development right" refers solely and
exclusively to development density or floor area that may be transferred for
development on another site, lot, parcel, or portion thereof, and not to
development rights within a sending area. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to limit, waive, or exempt any development standards applicable to
the airfield environs overlay district (AED), which standards shall remain in
full force and effect within the sending area.
   C.   Documentation of compliance with the requirements for eligibility as a
sending area shall be submitted with a master development plan requesting a
rezoning to CIO. (Ord. 04-02, 1-6-2004)
11-15-3: RECEIVING AREAS DESIGNATED:
No severable development rights shall be exercised in conjunction with the
development of subdivision of any parcel of land that is not located in a
receiving area. A parcel of land that receives development rights pursuant to
this chapter shall be referred to as a "receiver site". The following districts
located within the urban area boundary except for land located in the AED
zoning overlay designated on the urban area boundary map are hereby designed as
receiving areas for purposes of transferring severable development rights:
   CIO   commercial incentive overlay
Sending areas and receiver sites may be designated on the same lot or parcel,
or on separate parcels, whether under the same ownership or common ownership.
(Ord. 04-02, 1-6-2004)
11-15-4: NOTICE AND HEARING REQUIREMENTS:
Any proposed transfer of development rights from the sending area or to the
receiver site shall be subject to the notice and hearing requirements of 11
Oklahoma Statutes section 43-104. (Ord. 04-02, 1-6-2004)

exercise the power and authority to review, approve and disapprove transfers of
land hereinafter referred to as "lot splits". (Ord. 98-25, 9-1-1998)
12-3-2: DEFINITION:
   A.   Term Defined: A "lot split" is herein defined as the subdivision of
land into no more than two (2) lots, parcels, tracts or sites, any one of which
when divided has an area of ten (10) acres or less and which does not require
the dedication, vacation or alignment of any right of way, easement or street,
under the regulations as would ordinarily be required when subdividing. A "lot
split" would include all processes related to the conveyance of title by:
      1.   Deed by metes and bounds description;
      2.   Deed described by reference to an unapproved (preliminary) or
vacated plat; and
      3.   Deed resulting from the adjustment of lot lines in an approved plat.
   B.   Classification: The classification of a proposed subdivision as a lot
split shall be limited to those instances where any public improvements
required as a condition of development, except for the extension of service to
individual lots, either have been provided or are not reasonably accessible.
(Ord. 98-25, 9-1-1998)
12-3-3: APPROVAL PROCEDURE:
Whenever any lot split is proposed, the applicant shall secure approval in
accordance with the following procedure:
   A.   Design review process;
   B.   Administrative review;
   C.   Planning commission approval; and
   D.   Recording of deed(s). (Ord. 98-25, 9-1-1998)
12-3-4: DESIGN REVIEW PROCESS:
A meeting is recommended between the director of community development and the
applicant before the submittal of any proposed subdivision. The purpose of the
meeting is to determine the proper classification of the subdivision and to
provide technical assistance in the review of the proposal. Prior to design
review, the applicant should prepare a development sketch of the proposed
subdivision consisting of those elements as outlined below:
   A.   The general dimensions of the existing lot and the lot(s) to be created
by the subdivision;
   B.   The location of any rights of way or easements on or abutting the lot;

split approval, the applicant shall cause to be prepared an accurate survey of
the tract. The survey shall be prepared by a land surveyor registered in the
state of Oklahoma and shall contain the following elements:
      1.   Dimensions of the existing lot and the dimensions of the proposed
lot(s) to be created by the lot split;
      2.   The location and width of any streets or easements on or abutting
the lot;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all existing structures and any other
improvements, with their locations in relation to existing and proposed lot
lines.
   B.   Authority To Waive: The director may waive the requirement for a survey
if the tract or parcel is void of any improvements or any other design elements
which would necessitate the need of an accurate boundary description. (Ord. 98-
25, 9-1-1998)
12-3-6: ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW; FEE:
Upon receipt of a lot survey, other supporting data and fee, the director shall
review a lot split proposal for conformance with this title. To partially
defray the costs of administrative procedures, a fee of ten dollars ($10.00)
shall be paid to the city clerk at the time of application submittal for lot
split approval. (Ord. 98-25, 9-1-1998)
12-3-7: GUIDELINES FOR LOT SPLIT APPROVAL:
The approval or denial of a lot split shall be based upon the following
guidelines:
   A.   Conformance With Zoning Regulations: Lot dimensions and area shall
conform to the zoning regulations of the city. No lot split shall be approved
which would create a nonconforming lot.
   B.   Sewage Disposal: Adequate provisions shall be made for the proper
disposal of sewage. Each lot created by a lot split shall have direct access to
a public sewer. A lot not served by a public sewer shall be of sufficient area
to properly accommodate an individual sewage disposal system. Any lot split
application which would create a lot of one acre or less shall be accompanied
by appropriate tests performed by an authorized representative of the Garfield
County department of environmental quality, determining the proposed lot to be
suitable for an individual sewage disposal system.
   C.   Water Supply:
      1.   Each lot created by a lot split shall have direct access to a public
water supply. A lot not served by a public water main shall be of sufficient
area to properly accommodate both a water well and an individual sewage
disposal system, if a public sewer is not available.
      2.   Any lot split application which would create a lot of one acre or
less shall be accompanied by appropriate tests performed by an authorized
representative of the Garfield County department of environmental quality,
determining the proposed lot to be suitable for both a water well and an
individual sewage disposal system, when a public sewer is not available.
   D.   Access To Utilities: No lot split shall be approved which would create
a lot without access to adjacent or adjoining public utilities.
   E.   Access To Streets: No lot split shall be approved which would create a
lot without frontage upon a public street. (Ord. 98-25, 9-1-1998)
12-3-8: CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL:
When a lot split has been approved by the planning commission, such approval
shall be shown by certification signed and dated by the director on the
instrument of transfer. The applicant may then file the instrument with the
county clerk. (Ord. 98-25, 9-1-1998)
12-3-9: POLICY FOR APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL LOT SPLITS:
If a lot, parcel or tract has previously been subdivided, any subsequent lot
split requests may be disapproved by the planning commission if, in the opinion
of the commission, it is determined that the intent and purpose of the
subdivision regulations is being circumvented by the approval of any additional
lot splits, at which time platting shall be required. (Ord. 98-25, 9-1-1998)

transportation plan map, the arrangement and other design standards of streets
shall conform to the provisions found herein.
   B.   Relation To Adjoining Street System: The arrangement of streets in a
new subdivision shall make provision for the continuation of the existing
streets in adjoining areas.
   C.   Projection Of Streets: Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the
arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make provisions for the
proper projection of streets.
   D.   Streets Carried To Property Lines: When a new subdivision adjoins an
undeveloped parcel of land susceptible of being subdivided, then the new
streets shall be carried to the boundaries of the tract proposed to be
subdivided.
   E.   Street Jogs Prohibited: Street jogs at intersections with centerline
offsets of less than one hundred feet (100') shall be avoided.
   F.   Dead End Street Or Cul-De-Sac: Dead end streets or cul-de-sacs designed
to be so permanently, shall not be longer than six hundred feet (600') in
length, and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an
outside roadway diameter of at least eighty feet (80'), and a street property

on local streets, with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves.
   Q.   Railroad Or Highway Abutting Subdivision: Where a subdivision borders
on or contains a railroad right of way or limited access highway right of way,
the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to, and on
each side of, such right of way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use
of the intervening land, or for park purposes in residential districts, or for
commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distance shall
also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and
future grade separations.
   R.   Half Streets Prohibited: Half streets shall be prohibited, except where
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with
the other requirements of these regulations and where the planning commission
finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when

inches by sixty inches (60" x 60") located at intervals not to exceed two
hundred feet (200').
   F.   Driveway crossings must not create a cross slope for the sidewalk of
more than one and one-half percent (11/2%).
   G.   The minimum headroom is eighty inches (80").
   H.   Gratings may not have openings greater than one-half inch (1/2") and
the long dimension of the openings must run perpendicular to the direction of
travel.
   I.   Sidewalks that include directional signs must include braille with the
baseline of the tactile characters between forty eight inches (48") and sixty
inches (60").
   J.   Curb ramps should be designed consistent with the following:
      1.   Provide a level maneuvering area at the top of the curb ramp;
      2.   Clearly identify the boundary between the bottom of the curb ramp
and the street with a detectable warning that extends the full width of the
ramp and runs for twenty four inches (24") from the bottom of the ramp;
      3.   Place the curb ramp within the marked crosswalk area;
      4.   Design the ramp so that it does not require turning or maneuvering
on the ramp surface;
      5.   Design the ramp with a maximum grade of 7.1 percent;
      6.   Design the ramp and gutter with a cross slope of one and one- half
percent (11/2%) maximum;

of travel from the top of the ramp to the center of the roadway to the curb
ramp on the other side.
   K.   Detectable warnings for curb ramps should consist of truncated domes
with:
      1.   A bottom diameter of twenty three millimeters (23 mm) (0.9 inch);
      2.   A top diameter of ten millimeters (10 mm) (0.4 inch);

   L.   When sidewalks are being constructed or modified along streets that
have already been constructed, these standards may need to be modified to
adjust to the particular layout of the land, property, street and utilities.
Care should be taken to ensure accessibility is enhanced and not diminished by
construction but strict compliance may not be feasible. In these circumstances
parallel curb ramps, blended transitions, or other designs may be utilized.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ORDINANCE. (Ord. 2019-05, 4-16-2019, eff. 6-7-2019)
13-1-2: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma has
in 82 Oklahoma Statutes sections 1601 through 1618, as amended, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt ordinances designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City of Enid, Oklahoma, ordains the
following, to become effective immediately.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Enid are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      2.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other property because they are inadequately elevated,
flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   D.   Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter uses the following methods:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve public or private uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
      3.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      4.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
      5.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 2019-05, 4-16-2019, eff. 6-7-2019)

FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas in a
"special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding.
Such a system typically includes dams, reservoirs, stormwater detention
facilities, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those
constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The Director of Engineering for the City of Enid or
his or her designee who is a person accredited by the OWRB to administer and
implement laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the management of
floodplains.

preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, flood control projects, and
floodplain management regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning Codes and ordinances, subdivision
regulations, Building Codes, health regulations, special purpose regulations
and ordinances (such as floodplain, grading and erosion control regulations)
and other applications of police power. The term describes such State or local

changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, utilities, water, and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height. A floodway is located within areas of special flood hazard established
in subsection
13-1-4B of this chapter. A floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use that cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading
and unloading of passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but

associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including a
basement). However, an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of section 60.3 of title 44 CFR.

elevations shown on the City of Enid's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM, March 15, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the City of
Enid City Commission and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures, or March 15, 1979.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the City of Enid City
Commission, or March 15, 1979.
OWRB: The Oklahoma Water Resources Board.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;

START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, 16 USC section 3501 et
seq., includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit
was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; the installation of streets
or walkways; excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; the installation on the property of accessory
structures. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications
which have been identified by the local Code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions, or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by the Floodplain Board (the City of Enid City
Commission) to a person from the terms of this chapter when specific
enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore,
permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
chapter. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of title 44 CFR.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to mean sea level, as defined
by the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where
specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains
of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 2019-05, 4-16-2019, eff. 6-7-2019)
13-1-4: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Enid,
Oklahoma.
   B.   Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard (SFHA) identified by FEMA in a scientific and engineering
report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for Garfield County, Oklahoma and
Incorporated Areas" dated June 7, 2019 with the accompanying flood insurance
rate map (FIRM) are adopted and effective on June 7, 2019 by reference and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
   C.   Establishment Of Development Permit: A development permit shall be
required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Before
starting construction of a development or improvement in the SFHA, a
development permit is required.
   D.   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered,
or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations.
   E.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and any other ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   F.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State Statutes.
   G.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-
made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the City of Enid or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 2019-05, 4-16-2019, eff. 6-7-2019)

         d.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      2.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

applicable;
         i.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and
         j.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
for that area.
      3.   The Floodplain Administrator or the Floodplain Board, as applicable,
may approve certain development in Zones A or AE delineated on the Garfield
County FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by
more than one foot (1'), provided that the applicant for the development permit
in that case first complies with 44 CFR section 65.12.
   D.   Variances:
      1.   General Provisions:
         a.   The Floodplain Board may grant variances for uses which do not
satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act, 82 Oklahoma
Statutes 1601 et seq., as amended, or this chapter, if the applicant for the
variance presents adequate proof that: 1) compliance with this chapter will
result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property without sufficient
benefit or advantage to the people and 2) satisfies the pertinent provisions of
this subsection D. However, no variance shall be granted where the effect of
the variance will be to permit the continuance of a condition which
unreasonably creates flooding hazards.
         b.   Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any
person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain
Management Act or by other laws of the State.
         c.   In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than
twenty (20) years pursuant to 82 Oklahoma Statutes section 1615(C). Any change
in use or design of the development will render the variance void.
         d.   Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the
Floodplain Board, accompanied by a filing fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00).
         e.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection C2 of this
section and provisions of this subsection D have been fully considered. As the
lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
         f.   Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base
flood elevation will need to include within the variance paperwork a signed and
notarized statement to the City Clerk that they are fully aware that: 1) the
cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting
from permitting the structure to be built lower than the base flood elevation,
and 2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and
property.
         g.   At such time as the Floodplain Board deems the petition ready for
notification to the public, the City Clerk shall schedule a hearing and direct
the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation
in Garfield County at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing.
         h.   The Floodplain Board shall conduct the hearing and make
determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subsection
D. The Floodplain Board shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities
involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the
public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted.
         i.   Variances shall only issue upon:
            (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
            (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances;
and
            (4)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         j.   Upon consideration of the factors stated in this subsection D and
the intent of this chapter, the Floodplain Board may attach such conditions to
the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and
objectives stated in subsection
13-1-2C of this chapter.
         k.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any
variance issued by the Floodplain Board shall be sent by the Floodplain
Administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within fifteen (15) days after issuance of
the variance.
      2.   Special Provisions:
         a.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
         b.   Variances shall not issue within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         c.   Variances may issue for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
         d.   Variances may issue for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
            (1)   The criteria of subsections D1e, D1i, D2b, and D2c of this
section are met, and
            (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety. (Ord. 2019-05, 4-16-2019, eff. 6-7-2019)

13-3-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state of Oklahoma has, in 82 Oklahoma Statutes sections
1601 through 1618, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city does
hereby adopt this stormwater management chapter. (Ord. 2009-01, 1-6-2009)
13-3-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   Because of its physical terrain and geographical location, the city is
particularly subject to damage from stormwaters, which, from time to time,
overflow from existing watercourses and drainage facilities.
   C.   The presently existing stormwater drainage facilities of the city
require continuous operation, maintenance, renewal and replacement.
   D.   A comprehensive approach to managing stormwater runoff is required to
address existing and future needs.
   E.   The cost of operating and maintaining all stormwater drainage systems,
and the financing of existing and future necessary repairs, replacement,
improvements, and extensions thereof, should, to the extent practicable, be
allocated in relationship to the benefit enjoyed and services received
therefrom.
   F.   Requiring the construction of regional master drainage plan detention
sites, mitigation of stormwater runoff through on site detention and payment of
stormwater development fees and stormwater utility service charges are the most
equitable methods of implementing a comprehensive stormwater management
program. (Ord. 2009-01, 1-6-2009)
13-3-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and welfare
by providing for operating, constructing, equipping, maintaining, acquiring and
owning within the city a stormwater drainage system. The establishment of a
stormwater drainage system will:
   A.   Minimize flood and storm losses and inconveniences from uncontrolled
stormwater runoff in the city;
   B.   Assure that the movement of emergency vehicles is not prohibited nor
inhibited during storm or flood periods;
   C.   Preserve the city's watercourses, improve and preserve purity of water,
minimize water quality degradation, and otherwise facilitate urban water
resource management techniques, including both the reduction of pollution and
the enhancement of the urban environment;
   D.   Establish an overall plan and master plan for stormwater and flood
management and its implementation, including, without limitation, a coordinated
program of creating upstream ponding or temporary detention of stormwaters;
   E.   Establish stormwater and flood management utility to coordinate,
design, construct, manage, operate, and maintain the stormwater and flood
management system;
   F.   Establish reasonable stormwater utility and flood management fees based
on the use of stormwater drainage system and flood drainage facilities; and
   G.   Establish reasonable stormwater and flood management fees based on the
impact or future impact of development on the stormwater drainage system. (Ord.
2009-01, 1-6-2009)

13-3-6: STORMWATER DRAINAGE FUND:
A separate account or accounts shall be maintained for the purpose of
identifying and controlling all revenues to stormwater drainage services. The
costs of administrating, data collection, planning, maintaining, operating, and
improving drainage services and facilities shall be paid from these revenues.
(Ord. 2009-01, 1-6-2009)
13-3-7: MASTER DRAINAGE PLAN:
   A.   Plan Developed: The director shall develop a master drainage plan for
the city, based on engineering studies, that indicates the location of all
drainage facilities in the city, including those facilities that currently
exist and those determined to be needed and that are intended to be constructed
in the future. The plan may also show any other information that the director
deems desirable.
   B.   Purpose Of Plan: The purpose of the master drainage plan prescribed by
this section is to identify and propose a system to alleviate present and
future drainage and flooding problems in the city by means of presenting in an
orderly fashion the general data and information essential in understanding the
relationship between rainfall and storm runoff. The master drainage plan serves
as the official designation of drainage facilities, drainageways and basins.
These may be altered from time to time to conform to existing conditions or new
information.
   C.   Cost Estimate: The director may undertake supplementary studies to
determine the estimated cost of constructing the drainage facilities shown on
the master drainage plan, including the expense of any necessary land
acquisition.
   D.   Individual Basin Plans: The citywide master drainage plan may include
individual basin plans such as the 1987 master drainage plan northwest area
drainage basin that was adopted by the mayor and board of commissioners.
   E.   Substantial Modifications: Substantial modifications to the master
drainage plan shall be adopted by city commission action. (Ord. 2009-01, 1-6-
2009)
13-3-8: SUBDIVISION PLAT, SITE PLAN AND BUILDING PERMIT APPROVAL:
All subdivision plats, replats, site plans and industrial building permits
shall be approved by the community development department. The review and
approval of any plat, replat, site plan or industrial building permit by the
community development department shall require the submittal and acceptance of
drainage plans in accordance with the city subdivision regulations, standard
construction specifications and details, and this chapter. (Ord. 2009-01, 1-6-
2009)
13-3-9: STORMWATER MITIGATION:
   A.   Mitigation Required: All development that involves the filing of a
plat, replat, site plan or industrial building permit must mitigate the impact
of that development's stormwater runoff by performing work on a regional master
drainage plan detention site located within the same basin as the development,
or pay the development fee as outlined in section
13-3-10 of this chapter.
   B.   Amount Of Work: The amount of work to be done at the detention site is
the amount necessary to mitigate the entire stormwater runoff caused by the
proposed development.
   C.   Responsibility To Mitigate: This mitigation work does not relieve the
developer from the responsibility to mitigate that development's stormwater
impact from the development's site to the main drainage channel of the
stormwater master plan (the impacted channel). If the flow is above the
impacted channel's capacity anywhere from the development to the main drainage
channel, the proposed development must detain the stormwater on site, or
relieve the impact through mitigation in another manner.
   D.   Development Fee: Where work cannot be done to stormwater master plan
detention sites within the development basin, the developer must pay the
development fee as outlined in section
13-3-10 of this chapter.
   E.   Developments Outside Limits Of Master Plan: The drainage study for a
proposed development that is not located within a master drainage plan shall
include a plan to mitigate stormwater impact on the properties located
downstream between the proposed development and the main drainage channel.
Where on site detention is proposed to mitigate the impact, the developer may
make application to amend the master plan to add the proposed on site detention
to the plan as a regional detention site.
      1.   Application to add on site detention to the master plan shall
include a detailed revised hydrology and hydraulic analysis of the master plan
study showing that the proposed detention will provide adequate protection,
offset certain improvements, and not increase the operational maintenance cost,
or otherwise increase the public burden.
      2.   Credits under section
13-3-10 of this chapter may issue if the regional detention site provides
capacity in excess of what is required to be offset by the proposed
development.
      3.   If the on site detention is not to serve as a regional detention
site, it does not alleviate the requirement to pay the fee under section
13-3-10 of this chapter. (Ord. 2009-01, 1-6-2009)
13-3-10: DEVELOPMENT FEE REQUIREMENTS; CREDITS:
   A.   Development Fee: Where work is not done to a regional stormwater
detention site, or the amount of work does not offset the impact, the developer
shall be required to pay a stormwater development fee at the time of the
subdivision plat, replat, site plan or industrial building permit approval as
provided for in section
2-6E-10 of this code.
   B.   Obtaining Credits: Credits can be obtained by developers to offset
stormwater development fees for a particular tract of land by providing
necessary property for master plan improvements. Credits are calculated in
dollars based on the following:
      1.   Dollar value of credits for land provided shall be based on the
appraised value, less the cost of appraisal. Only land that provides for
drainage improvements compatible with the master drainage plan may be provided
for credits. The dedication of property or the granting of easements normally
provided as part of the development process cannot be used for credit.
      2.   Dollar value of improvements provided shall be mutually agreed upon
and shall be based on the beneficial share of a complete project based on the
master drainage plan construction cost. Interim and incidental work such as
erosion protection, engineering, staking, safety measures and access roads
shall not be calculated as a beneficial share. Where detailed construction
plans are not available, an interim construction plan shall be provided by the
developer.
      3.   Where engineering services are proposed for credit, the dollar value
shall be mutually agreed upon based on a detailed proposal of the engineering
services and conditioned upon acceptance of the construction plan.
   C.   Issuance Of Credits: Credits shall issue by letter upon the completion
of the work and/or acceptance of the land by the city commission.
      1.   Letter agreements shall establish the value of the credit. Credits
shall be tied to a specific basin but may be transferred to a third party with
notice to the city.
      2.   Use of credits may be made at the time of approval of a plat,
replat, lot split, or building permit. Credits shall be set out on a per acre
basis in the letter agreement.
      3.   Application to use credit shall include a copy of the letter
agreement and, if applicable, the credit transfer.
      4.   Any credit amount applied against the stormwater development fee
shall be deducted from the amount of the fee set out for the referenced tract
or tracts.
      5.   At any time the remaining credit for any tract shall fall below a
value of five hundred dollars ($500.00), no further credits can be applied for
under the referenced letter agreement, and the tracking of the use shall be
discontinued.
   D.   Application Of Credits: A developer may apply credits only to the
development of land within the drainage basin in which the land or work was
provided.
   E.   Special Credits: Special credits shall be established by letter
agreement for the following completed projects:
      1.   Willow Road detention facility completed in 1984; and
      2.   Grass lined channel on Bobsfarm Detention referenced by figure 7-
4 of the 1987 master drainage plan. (Ord. 2009-01, 1-6-2009)
