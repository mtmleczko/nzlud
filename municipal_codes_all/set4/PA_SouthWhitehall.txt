The Township of South Whitehall shall have power to indemnify any person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a part to any threatened,
pending or contemplated action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was
a Commissioner, officer, employee or agent of the Township of South
Whitehall, against expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs of the
Township Solicitor), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonable incurred by him in connection with such action,
suit, or proceeding, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Township of
South Whitehall, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
has no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the extent
that a Commissioner, officer, employee or agent of the Township has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to hereinabove under this section or in defense of any
claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses
(including attorneys, fees and costs of the Township Solicitor) actually and
reasonable incurred by him in connection therewith. The termination of
any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, or itself, create
a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner
which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests
of the Township, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
§ 25-2. Specific authorization.
Any indemnification under § 25-6, shall be made by the Township only as
authorized in a specific case upon a determination that indemnification
of the Commissioner, officer, employee or agent is proper in the
circumstances, because he has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth under § 25-1, hereinabove. Such determination shall be made by
the Township Commissioners by a majority vote of a quorum consisting
of Commissioners who are not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding,
except if all Commissioners are parties to the action the decision shall be
made by majority vote of the Township Manager, Auditor and Solicitor.
§ 25-3. Expenses.
Expenses incurred in the fees and costs incurred by the Township Solicitor
in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding may be paid
by the Township in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding as authorized in the manner provided under § 25-2 upon receipt
of an undertaking, as evidenced by the posting of security or a bond, by or
§ 25-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 25-3
1:33
on behalf of the Commissioners, officer, employee or agent to repay such
amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be
indemnified by the Township as authorized under this article.

The Township shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a Commissioner, officer, employee
or agent of the Township against any liability asserted against him and
incurred by him arising out of the performance of his duties and during the
course of his employment.
§ 25-5. Definitions.
Unless a context indicates otherwise, the words and phrases used in this
article shall have the following meanings:
EMPLOYEE — Any officer, employee or member of any board, commission,
committee, division or department, of the Township including elected or
appointed officials and persons acting on behalf of or in service of the
Township in any official capacity, whether with or without compensation.
Employee does not include an independent contractor under contract with
the Township who is providing services to the Township but who does
not serve in an official capacity. Employee does include former employees
for acts and omissions within the scope of their employment during their
former employment with the Township.
TOWNSHIP — The Township of South Whitehall, a Township of the first
class, situate in Lehigh County, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
§ 25-6. Indemnification. [Added 1-9-1990 by Ord. No. 477]
As a condition of service or employment with the Township, the Township
shall provide an employee, subject to the conditions and requirements of
this section, and notwithstanding the fact that such employee may have
concluded service or employment with the Township, such defense as may
be reasonable necessary to defend any claim, civil action or proceeding filed
against such employee, in his or her official or individual capacity or both,
on account of an act or omission which was within the scope of his or her
office or duties or which said employee in good faith reasonably believed
to be within the scope of his or her office or duties as an employee of the
Township.
A. The Township may provide for a defense by the Township Solicitor, may
employ other counsel for this purpose, or may purchase insurance
which requires that the insurer provide the defense. The Township has
no right to recover such expenses from the employee defended, except
as otherwise provided herein.
B. The Township may refuse to provide for the defense of an action against
an employee if the Township determines that:
§ 25-3 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 25-6
1:34
(1) The act or omission was not within the scope of such employee's
office or duties, and the employee in good faith did not reasonably
believe that such act was within the scope of his office or duties.
(2) The conduct of such employee constituted a crime, actual fraud,
actual malice or willful misconduct.
(3) The lawsuit or other legal proceeding was brought by or on behalf
of the Township.
C. The provisions of this section shall be applicable, provided that the
following conditions are met:
(1) The employee shall in writing request the Township to provide for
the defense of the employee after an action is commenced against
said employee.
(2) In addition to the written notice provided in Subsection C(1), the
employee shall cooperate fully with the defense of said action,
including the attendance at interviews, depositions, hearings and
trials as shall be necessary to defend said action.
D. When an action is brought against an employee of the Township for
damages on account of an injury to a person or property, and said
employee has given timely prior written notice to the Township, and it is
judicially determined that an act or omission of the employee caused
the injury and such act was, or the employee in good faith reasonably
believed that such act was, within the scope of his or her office or
duties, the Township shall indemnify the employee for the payment of
any judgment of the suit. To the extent permitted by law, the Township
shall provide indemnification for all damages, including punitive
damages, for acts or omissions which a court has not adjudicated as
constituting a crime, actual fraud, actual malice or willful misconduct.
Such indemnification shall include that portion of any judgment which
consists of attorney fees, costs and expenses awarded to the injured
party. The aforesaid provisions shall not limit the Township's right to
take an appeal as the Township in its discretion deems necessary from
any such judgment against the employee.
E. In the event that an employee fails or refuses to comply with any of the
conditions of this section or fails or refuses to cooperate with counsel
employed by the Township or its insurer, then all provisions of this
section shall be inapplicable and have no force or effect with respect to
any such claim or litigation. Nothing herein stated shall preclude an
employee from providing his or her own representation with regard to
any claim or action.
F. If the Township determines that an employee does not come within the
provisions of this section, and thus fails or refuses to provide an
employee with a defense, and a court of competent jurisdiction later
determines that such claim does come within the provisions of this
section, then the Township shall pay any judgment rendered against the
§ 25-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 25-6
1:35
employee and reasonable costs and fees incurred by the employee in
defending against such claim. The Township shall additionally pay any
attorney's fees incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim
is covered by the provisions of this section. Nothing in this section shall
be construed to deprive an employee of the right to petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to compel the Township to perform the duties
imposed by this section. If the Township determines that a claim against
an employee does come within the provisions of this section, and if the
employee fails to cooperate in good faith in the defense of the claim or
action or if a court of competent jurisdiction later finds that such claim
does not come within the provisions of this section, then the Township
shall be reimbursed for any payments made by it for any judgment, or
portion thereof and costs or attorney's fees incurred by or on behalf
of the employee's defense and the Township shall also be reimbursed
for costs or expenses incurred in obtaining the determination that such
claim is not covered by the provisions of this section.
(1) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to modify or
amend any provision of any policy of insurance. In the event of any
conflict between this section and the provisions of any such policy
of insurance, the policy provisions shall be controlling; provided,
however, that nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to
limit or restrict any employees right to full coverage pursuant to
this section, it being the intent of this section to provide complete
coverage outside and beyond insurance policies which may be in
effect, while not compromising the terms and conditions of such
policies by any conflicting provisions contained in this section.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be additionally construed as
abrogating or waiving any governmental immunity or limitation of
liability presently or hereafter made applicable to the Township or
its employees which would otherwise be applicable in any action or
proceeding to which this section would apply.
G. The provisions of this section shall apply to any pending claim or
lawsuit against an employee, or any such claim or lawsuit hereafter
filed irrespective of the date of the events or circumstances which are
the basis of such claim or lawsuit. Provided, however, that in any
pending claim, action or proceeding for which the Township is currently
providing a defense for an employee that such employee shall not be
required to provide a written request for the provisions of written
defense.

A. In general. A participant may elect, from time to time, to make
contributions to this plan. All such contributions shall be on an after tax

withholding authorizations at any time, subject to the reasonable
regulations of the Committee.
(1) Uniformed service. A participant may continue to make
contributions to the plan during a period of service in the
uniformed services of the United States. Moreover, if such a
participant returns to employment with the employer, he/she may
designate one or more contributions made to the plan during the
applicable period as being made with respect to one or more of the
plan years included in whole or in part in the period of uniformed
service. For purposes of this Subsection A(1), the "applicable
period" shall mean the period beginning with the date of

A. In general. Each plan year, the employer shall make matching
contributions to the plan on behalf of all employees who make employee
contributions to this plan under § 58-4A during that plan year. The
employer matching contributions for a plan year shall be transmitted to
the trustee for deposit in the trust no later than 30 calendar days after
the beginning of the following plan year, and shall be credited as of the
last day of the plan year for which they were contributed.
(1) Matches of contributions for periods of uniformed service. The
employer shall make matching contributions to the plan on behalf
of all persons who make employee contributions to this plan under
§ 58-4A(1) within a reasonable period after the later of: (1) the date
the person made the employee contribution; or (2) the person was
reemployed by the employer; provided, that the person returns to
employment with the employer at a time when the employer is
legally obligated to reemploy the person under the Uniformed
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38
U.S.C. § 4301 et seq., and any amendments, supplements or
successor legislation. All such matching contributions shall be
credited as of the date they are received by the trustee, without
modification for any Income which may have been earned had the
matching contributions been made earlier.
B. Matching contribution accounts; amount of matching contributions. A
matching contribution account shall be created for each participant
who elects to make employee contributions to the plan under this
section. For each plan year that a participant makes an employee
contribution to the plan under Subsection A and/or for which the
participant designates an employee contribution under Subsection
A(1), the employer shall contribute an amount to the plan, which shall
be credited to the participant's matching contribution account, equal to
the lesser of:
(1) Two times the amount of employee contributions made to the plan
for that plan year.
(2) One thousand dollars.
C. Special rules. In the case of any police union employee, the amount set
forth in Subsection B(2) shall be increased to $2,000 for calendar year

mean the net gain or loss of the trust from investments, as reflected by
interest payments, dividends, realized and unrealized gains and losses

1:61
§ 58-7. Maximum additions.
B. Annual determination of income. Each accounting date the trustee shall
determine the income of the trust since the last accounting date.
C. Allocation of income. The income of the trust shall be allocated to the
employee contribution accounts and matching contribution accounts of
all participants and former participants as of each accounting date
(except those accounts which do not have a positive account balance on
such date). Income shall be allocated as credits or debits to the affected
accounts as of the accounting date for which it is being determined. The
income shall be allocated among the accounts according to each
accounts portion of the following total:
(1) The balances in the account as of the last accounting date.
(2) Minus, the amount of any distributions from the account since the
last accounting date multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is
the number of days from the date of distribution to the current
accounting date and whose denominator is the total number of days
since the last accounting date.
(3) Plus, the amount of all contributions to the accounts (taken on a
contribution-by-contribution basis) multiplied by a fraction whose
numerator is the number of days between the date as of which the
contributions were credited to the account and the current
accounting date, and who denominator is the total number of days
since the last accounting date.
A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this plan:
(1) The maximum amount of annual additions which may be made to
this plan or allocated under any other defined contribution plan of
the employer for any plan year shall not exceed the lesser of
$30,000 [or, if greater, 1/4 of the defined benefit dollar limitation
set forth in § 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect
for that plan year], or 25% of the participant's compensation for the
plan year.
(2) The term "annual additions" for any plan year, shall mean the
following amounts which are allocated on behalf of a participant for
the given plan year.
(a) All employer contributions under a defined contribution plan of
the employer, including elective contributions under a cash or
deferred arrangement.

employee contributions to a simplified employee pension which
§ 58-6 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-7
1:62
are excludible from gross income under Code § 408(k)(6).
[Amended 2-2-1994 by Ord. No. 581]
(c) All forfeitures under a defined contribution plan of the
employer.
(d) All amounts allocated after March 31, 1984, to an individual

[Amended 2-2-1994 by Ord. No. 581]
(g) Any other amounts required to be treated as "annual additions"
under § 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. [Amended
2-2-1994 by Ord. No. 581]
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the otherwise permissible contributions
for any participant or former participant under this plan may be further
reduced to the extent necessary, as determined by the Committee, to
prevent disqualification of the plan under § 415 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, which imposes the following additional limitations on the
contributions for persons who also may be participating in another tax
qualified pension, profit sharing, savings, or stock bonus plan of the
employer.
(1) If an individual is a participant at any time in both a defined benefit
plan and a defined contribution plan maintained by the employer,
the sum of the defined benefit plan fraction and the defined
contribution plan fraction for any plan year may not exceed 1.0.
(2) The defined benefit plan fraction for any plan year is a fraction, the
numerator of which is the participant's projected annual benefit
under the plan (determined at the close of the plan year) and the
denominator of which is the lesser of: (1) 1.25 multiplied by the
larger of the dollar limitation in effect for the plan year under
§ 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as adjusted
under § 415(b) and § 415(d) of such code; or (2) 140% of the
average compensation of the participant for the three consecutive
plan years of service with the employer that produces the highest
average, including any adjustments under § 415(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code. The term "projected annual benefit" shall mean the
§ 58-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-7
1:63
§ 58-8. Benefits.
annual retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled
under the terms of the plan, adjusted to the actuarial equivalent
of a straight life annuity or qualified joint and survivor annuity
under § 1.415-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations, assuming that
the participant will continue employment until the normal
retirement age under the plan (or current age, if later), and that
the participant's compensation for the current plan year, and all
other relevant factors used to determine benefits under the plan,
will remain constant for all future plan years. [Amended 2-2-1994
by Ord. No. 581]
(3) The defined contribution plan fraction for any plan year is a
fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the annual additions
to the participant's account in such plan year and for all prior plan
years and the denominator of which is the sum of the applicable
maximum amounts of annual additions which could have been
made under § 415(c) of the Internal Revenue Code for such plan
year and for all prior years of such participant's employment
[assuming for this purpose, that said § 415(c) had been in effect
during such prior years]. The applicable maximum amount for any
plan year shall be equal to the lesser of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar
limitation in effect for such plan year under § 415(c)(1)(A) of the
Internal Revenue Code, or 1.4 multiplied by 25% of the
participant's total annual compensation for such plan year.
C. For purposes of the limitations described in Subsections A and B, all
defined benefit plans of the employer, whether or not terminated, are to
be treated as one defined benefit plan, and all defined contribution
plans of the employer, whether or not terminated, are to be treated as
one defined contribution plan.
D. If the limitations of Subsections A and B would be exceeded at any time,
the amount of employee contributions (and resulting employer
matching contributions) which may be made under this Plan shall be
reduced before any reductions are made in the contributions or benefits
available under any other plan of the employer.
E. The limitations described in this section are intended to comply with
the provisions of § 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. If
there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this section and the
provisions of § 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations
thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give
full effect to the provisions of § 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and
the regulations thereunder.
A. In general. The plan benefits of a participant (or his beneficiary) shall
be paid within 60 calendar days after the end of the plan year in which
the participant's (or former participant's) employment with the
employer terminates (for whatever reason). However, no benefits shall
§ 58-7 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-8
1:64
commence to any participant if the participant have been reemployed
by the employer at that time.
B. Latest commencement of benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this plan, the plan benefits of a participant who attains age
70 1/2 prior to the date for distribution of benefits under Subsection A
shall receive a distribution of all his/her plan benefits no later than April
1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
participant or former participant attains age 70 1/2. If any new benefits
under this plan accrue in that calendar year or subsequent years, a
distribution of the benefits which accrue in a given calendar year shall
be made no later than April 1 of the following calendar year.
C. Compliance with code § 401(a)(9). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this plan, all distributions of plan benefits must
comply with the provisions of § 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (or any successor provision of any future federal internal
revenue law) and the regulations thereunder, and the incidental death
benefits rules of the Internal Revenue Service.
D. Form and amount of benefits.
(1) Except as provided in Subsection D(2), all benefits under this plan

account and matching contribution account. The balances in such
accounts shall be 100% vested.
(2) Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, a

any recipient until an administratively reasonable period of time after
the recipient shall file with or make available to the Committee such
information as the Committee may require to determine that the
recipient is entitled to receive such benefits under this plan at that
time, or to administer the payment of such benefits.
G. Loans and withdrawals. No loans shall be provided by this plan and no
premature withdrawals of benefits shall be permitted from this plan.
A. Administrative committee.

the Committee or the employer.
B. The trust.

trustee or trustees appointed by the Commissioners, in trust, in
accordance with the terms of the trust agreement which follows

1:68
§ 58-10. Amendment.
for the administration of the trust funds or any liability for any loss
with respect thereto.

shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive
benefit of participants, former participants and contingent

any interest in or right to any part of the earnings or assets of the
trust except as and to the extent expressly provided in the plan and
in the trust agreement.
(3) Source of plan benefits. The trust is designed to be and shall be the

A. The Commissioners may, by ordinance, at any time and from time to
time modify or amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of
the plan and/or trust agreement, including the method of financing the
plan, provided that:
(1) No such modification or amendment shall make it possible for any
part of the funds of the plan to be used for or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of participants, former
participants, and contingent annuitants under the plan prior to the
satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to them.
(2) No such modification or amendment shall make it possible for the

§ 58-11. Termination.
§ 58-12. Miscellaneous provisions. [Amended 2-2-1994 by Ord. No.
581]
(4) No such modification or amendment shall affect the rights, duties
or responsibilities of the trustee without the written consent of the
trustee.

the plan may be made by ordinance, retroactively if necessary, which
the Commissioners may deem necessary or appropriate to make the
plan conform to the requirements of any law or governmental
regulation now or hereafter enacted or promulgated, or to qualify the
plan and trust as exempt under existing or future Federal, State or local
income tax or estate tax laws and regulations.

this plan shall be permanent, it reserves the right to terminate the plan
for any reason at any time and discontinue contributions to this plan, to
the extent permitted by state and federal law.

funds of the plan and trust shall be used to provide for a distribution of
benefits to participants and former participants in accordance with
their account balances under the plan, as soon as administratively
convenient after the termination.
A. No other legal rights conferred by plan. The establishment and
maintenance of this plan shall not be construed as conferring any legal
rights upon employees or other persons to a continuation of
employment with the employer nor shall it interfere with the rights of
the employer to discharge any person or to treat him without regard to
the effect which such treatment might have upon him as a participant
or former participant in the plan.
B. Spendthrift provisions. No benefit under this plan shall be subject in
any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,
pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to do so shall be void,
except as specifically provided in this plan, nor shall any such benefit be
in any manner liable for or subject to garnishment, attachment,
execution, levy or other legal process for the collection of debts, or
liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or
torts of the person entitled to such benefit. In the event the Committee
shall find that any participant, former participant or beneficiary under
this plan has become incompetent, bankrupt or insolvent, or that any
attempt has been made to anticipate, alienate, sell transfer, assign,
pledge, encumber or charge any of his benefits under the plan, except
as specifically provided in the plan, then such benefit shall cease and
terminate and in such event the Committee and the trustee shall hold or
apply the same to or for the benefit of such participant, former
§ 58-10 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-12

§ 58-13. Nondiscrimination provisions. [Amended 2-2-1994 by Ord.
No. 581]
participant or contingent annuitant, his spouse, children or other
dependents, or any of them, in such manner as the Committee may find
proper from time to time.
C. Right to inspect documents. Notwithstanding any information that is
made available by the employer, Committee or trustee to any person
through the distribution of descriptive booklets, bulletin board notices,
payroll notices or oral announcements, any participant or former
participant may examine the plan as presented in this article and
amendments thereto, and the trust agreement and all amendments
thereto, at the main office of the employer at such mutually convenient
time as is arranged by the participant or former participant and a
representative of the employer, Committee or trustee.
D. Construction. When used herein, the masculine shall include the
feminine and neuter, as appropriate.
E. Governing law. This plan shall be construed, regulated and
administered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
the applicable laws of the United States of America.
A. Applicability. The portions of this plan which cover police union
employees and public works union employees automatically satisfy the
requirements of § 401(a)(4), § 410(b), and § 401(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Treas. Regs. § 1.401(m) - 1(a)(3); § 1.401(a)(4) - 1(c)(5);
§ 1410(b) - 2(b)(7). However, those provisions are applicable to the
portion of the plan which covers office personnel employees, Treas.
Regs. § 1.401(a)(4) - 1(c)(12); § 1.401(a)(4) - 13(b) (effective January 1,
1996); § 1.401(m) - 1(g)(4) (effective January 1, 1993); § 1.410(a) - 1(c)
[to the extent of the requirements of Code § 401(a)(3) as in effect of
September 1, 1974]. The remaining provisions of this section are
intended to satisfy the requirements of § 401(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code and apply only with respect to office personnel
employees. Since the employer does not maintain a cash or deferred
arrangement under § 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and is not
permitted to establish such an arrangement under § 401(k)(4)(B), the
aggregate limit requirements of Treas. Regs. § 1.401(m)-2 are
automatically satisfied by the actual contribution percentage test
provided under this section as required by Treas. Regs. § 1.401(m)-1.
B. General rule.
(1) The average actual contribution percentage of the highly
compensated testing units (HC-ACP) in any plan year may not
exceed the amount specified in the table below, based upon the
average actual contributions percentage of the eligible nonhighly
compensated employees (NHC-ACP) for such plan year:
§ 58-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-13
1:71
NHC-ACP Maximum HC-ACP
0% — 2% 2.0 x NHC-ACP
2% — 8% NHC-ACP + 2.0%
8% or greater 1.25 x NHC-ACP
(2) The Committee shall limit the amount of contributions made by or
on behalf of members of highly compensated testing units to insure
that the limitations of Subsection B(1) are satisfied. If, at the end of
a plan year, the amount of contributions made by or on behalf of a
participant result in an actual contribution percentage for the
highly compensated testing unit which is in excess of the maximum
percentage permitted that is consistent with the limitations set
forth in Subsection A, this plan shall distribute to the participant
the amount of employee contributions (and forfeit any resulting
matching contributions) necessary to eliminate such excess,
together with any income (or less any loss) allocable thereto, no
later than 2.5 months after the last day of the plan year.
C. Average actual contribution percentage for a group of employees. For
purposes of this section, the "average actual contribution percentage"
of the highly compensated testing units for a plan year means the sum
of the actual contribution percentages of each highly compensated
testing unit for the plan year (including 0%, where applicable), divided
by the total number of highly compensated testing units for the plan
year. Similarly, the "average actual contribution percentages of each
eligible nonhighly compensated employee for the plan year (including,
0%, where applicable), divided by the total number of eligible nonhighly
compensated employees for the plan year. (If there are no eligible
nonhighly compensated employees for any plan year, the average actual
contribution percentage of such employees for such plan year shall be
100%).
D. Actual contribution percentage of a single employee.
(1) The actual contribution percentage of a given eligible nonhighly
compensated employee for any given plan year is equal to the
percentage equivalent of the total amount of employee and
matching contributions made by or on behalf of the eligible
nonhighly compensated employee for the plan year, divided by the
compensation of the eligible nonhighly compensated employee for
the portion of the plan year in which the person was a qualified
employee, with the result rounded to the nearest 0.01%.
(2) The actual contribution percentage of a given highly compensated
testing unit for any given plan year is equal to the percentage
equivalent of the total amount of employee and matching
contributions made by or on behalf of all members of the highly
compensated testing unit for the plan year under this plan and all
other plans of the employer to which matching contributions are
§ 58-13 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-13
1:72
made or to which employee contributions that are treated as after
tax contributions and that are allocated to a separate account to
which the attributable earnings and losses are allocated are made,
divided by the total compensation of all members of the highly
compensated testing unit for the portion of the plan year in which
such persons were qualified employees, with the result rounded to
the nearest 0.01%.
(3) For purposes of this Subsection D, employee contributions are
considered to have been made in the plan year in which contributed
to a plan or trust. Matching contributions will be considered to
have been made for a given plan year of the plan to which they
were made if they were contributed no later than the end of the
twelve-month period beginning on the day after the close of such
plan year and were designated as being made for such plan year.
The term "matching contribution" means an employer contribution
made to this or any other defined contribution plan on behalf of a
participant on account of an employee contribution made by such
participant or on account of an elective deferral by such participant
under a plan maintained by the employer.
E. Eligible non-highly compensated employee. For purposes of this
section, the term "eligible nonhighly compensated employee" for any
plan year shall mean a person who is an office personnel employee for
any part of that plan year and who is not a highly compensated
employee or a member of a highly compensated family.
F. Highly compensated testing unit. For purposes of this section, the term
"highly compensated testing unit" for any plan year shall mean each of
the following:
(1) Each office personnel employee who is a highly compensated
employee for any part of the plan year and who is not a member of a
highly compensated family.
(2) All the members of any highly compensated family which has at
least one member who is an office personnel employee for any part
of that plan year. Together all of such members constitute a single
highly compensated testing unit.
G. Highly compensated employee.

compensated employee" shall include highly compensated active
employees and highly compensated former employees.
(2) Highly compensated active employees. The term "highly
compensated active employee" for any plan year includes any
employee [including leased employees and self-employed
individuals who are treated as employees under § 401(c)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code] who performs service for the employer
during the plan year and who, either (1) during the twelve-month

amount is $96,368).
(c) Received total compensation from the employer in excess of
$50,000 [as adjusted pursuant to Internal Revenue Code

such minimum compensation is $57,820.50).
(e) Was the highest paid officer of the employer for such year.
However, when making the above determination with respect
to the plan year, but not with respect to the twelve-month
period immediately preceding the plan year, a person shall not
be treated as satisfying Subsections G(2)(b), (c), (d) or (e)
unless he was also one of the 100 employees who received the
greatest total compensation from the employer during the plan
year.
(3) Highly compensated former employees. The term "highly
compensated former employee" for any plan year includes any
former employee [including leased employees and self-employed

Code § 401(c)(1)] who separated from service (or was deemed to
have separated from service) prior to the beginning of the plan
year, and was a highly compensated active employee for either the
separation year or any plan year ending on or after the employee's
55th birthday.
(4) Determination under internal revenue Code § 414(q) and
regulations. The determination of who is a highly compensated
employee, including the determinations of the number and identity

families shall be considered as a single highly compensated family.
I. Aggregation of plans. In the event that this plan satisfies the
requirements of § 401(a)(4) or § 401(b) of the Internal Revenue Code
only if aggregated with one or more other plans of the employer, or if
one or more other plans satisfy those requirements only if aggregated
with this plan, then this section shall be applied by determining actual
contribution percentages as if all matching contributions and employee
contributions made under the other plans were made under this plan.
J. Compliance with law and regulations. This section is intended to
comply with § 401(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the

shall also satisfy such other requirements as may be prescribed by the
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.

ARTICLE III
Office Personnel Pension Plan
[Adopted 12-1-2004 by Ord. No. 803; amended in its entirety
5-19-2010 by Ord. No. 912]
§ 58-15. Continuation of plan.
The Commissioners of the Township of South Whitehall established the
South Whitehall Township Employees' Pension Plan ("Employees' Plan")
and the South Whitehall Township Employees' Pension Trust ("Employees'
Trust"), effective December 31, 1967, by Ordinance No. 75, enacted
December 20, 1967. The Employees' Plan and the Employees' Trust have
been amended from time to time thereafter. Effective as of January 1,
1989, the Commissioners split the Employees' Plan and the Employees'
Trust into two separate plans and trusts, one for the nonunion employees
of the Township and the other for the nonuniformed union employees of
the Township. In order to do so, the Commissioners established the South
Whitehall Township Office Personnel Pension Plan and the South Whitehall
Township Office Personnel Pension Trust to cover the nonunion employees
of the Township. The other employees who were previously covered under
the Employees' Plan and the Employees' Trust continue to be covered under
such Plan and Trust, as amended, renamed and restated (see §§ 58-44
through 58-56). Effective as of January 1, 2010, the Commissioners hereby
continue said plan as the "South Whitehall Township Office Personnel
Pension Plan" and amend and restate it in its entirety. The pension benefits
of any participant who terminated his employment with the Township prior
to January 1, 2010, shall be determined solely under the provisions of the
plan in effect at the time of his termination.
§ 58-16. Definitions.
When used in §§ 58-15 through 58-27, with initial capital letters, the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless a different
meaning is plainly required by the context:
ANNIVERSARY DATE — Each December 31.
COMMISSIONERS — The Board of Commissioners of the Township of South
Whitehall.
COMMITTEE — The committee appointed by the Commissioners under
§ 58-24A to administer the Plan.
COMPENSATION — The Compensation of an employee for a given year
(or other period for which a determination is being made) shall mean the
amount of Compensation actually paid, made available, or includible in
gross income for the year (or other determination period). [In the case
of a period during which an employee is serving in the uniformed forces
of the United States, or during the term of any other approved leave of
absence, the employee's "Compensation" shall be computed (A) at the rate
the employee would have received but for the uniformed service or other
leave of absence, or (B) in the case that the determination of such rate
§ 58-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-16
1:79
is not reasonably certain, on the basis of the employee's average rate
of compensation during the twelve-month period immediately preceding
the period of uniformed service or leave of absence (or, if shorter, the
period of employment immediately preceding such period.)] However,
"Compensation" shall not include any compensation in excess of the amount
in effect for such year under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). If Compensation is ever required
to be determined for a period of time which contains fewer than 12 months,
the amount in effect for such period under Code Section 401(a)(17) shall
be equal to the amount in effect under Code Section 401(a)(17) for the
calendar year in which the period begins, multiplied by a fraction whose
numerator is equal to the number of months in the period, and whose
denominator is 12.
DISABLED — A person shall be considered "Disabled" if he has a physical
or mental condition which renders him qualified to receive permanent
and total disability benefits under the Federal Social Security Act (or any
successor Act) and only if he is actually receiving such benefits.
DISQUALIFYING EVENT — With respect to any given person, each of the
following shall be a "Disqualifying Event":
EMPLOYER — The Township of South Whitehall, a Pennsylvania First Class
Township and municipal corporation, located in Lehigh County,
Pennsylvania.
EQUIVALENT ACTUARIAL VALUE — The equivalent value when computed
on the basis of the following actuarial assumptions:
The voluntary or involuntary termination of the person's employment
with the Employer, unless the termination occurs due to the
conscription, enlistment or appointment of the person to service in the
Armed Forces of the United States, or because of a condition which
renders the person Disabled. However, if the Employer shall terminate
the person's employment due to insufficient work for such person or
shall indicate that the termination is temporary, such termination shall
be considered a "layoff" and not a "termination" unless the layoff
continues for a period in excess of six months. The mere cessation
of a person's status as a Qualified Employee shall not constitute a
"termination" under this subsection; only a termination from all
employment with the Employer shall be a "termination."
A.
The person's failure to return to work at the end of any leave of
absence, after ceasing to be Disabled, or upon recall following a layoff.
B.

Participant, the Compensation paid to the Participant or former Participant
during the thirty-six-month period ending on his Qualification Date (whether
for service as a Qualified Employee or otherwise), divided by 36. However,
if a Participant or former Participant shall not have been an employee
of the Employer throughout the thirty-six-month period, his Final Average
Monthly Compensation shall be his Compensation during his last 36 months
of employment through the Qualification Date (regardless of whether he
was employed as a Qualified Employee or otherwise), divided by 36; and
if he shall not have been an employee of the Employer for a total of at
least 36 months before his Qualification Date (whether consecutive or not),
his Final Average Monthly Compensation shall be his Compensation during
all periods of employment with the Employer through the Qualification
Date (regardless of whether he was employed as a Qualified Employee or
otherwise), divided by the number of months of his employment with the
Employer through the Qualification Date (rounded to the nearest 0.001 of a
month).

requirements of § 58-18.

§ 58-17. Service.
A. Vesting service. A person's vesting service as of any given date (the
"determination date") shall be determined as follows:
(1) Days of vesting service.
(a) In general. Except as provided in Subsection A(1)(b), the
person shall be credited with one day of vesting service for
each calendar day:
[1] That he is actually employed by the Employer (whether as
a Qualified Employee or not), including normal vacations,
holidays, sick leave, weekends and other days off; or
[2] Of service in the uniformed services of the United States,
provided that (I) such service immediately follows service

1:83
§ 58-18. Participation.
[8] On or before the date of any Disqualifying Event which

credited to the person as of the determination date shall be the sum
of:
(a) The number of calendar months in which every day of the
month is a day of vesting service; and
(b) The number of days of vesting service credited to the person as
of the determination date, other than those described under
Subsection A(2)(a), divided by the actual number of days in
such calendar month (rounding down any fraction to the next
whole number and eliminating any fractional amount).
(3) Years of Vesting Service. The number of Years of Vesting Service
credited to the person as of the determination date, which number
may be expressed as a fraction, shall be the number of months of
vesting service credited to the person as of the determination date
divided by 12.
B. Benefit accrual service. A person's benefit accrual service as of any
given date (the "determination date") shall be determined by applying
the provisions of Subsection A with the following modifications:
(1) The words "vesting service" shall be replaced with the words
"benefit accrual service" every time they occur therein; and
(2) Subsection A(1)(b)[2] shall be modified to read as follows: "within

than one described in Subsection A shall become a Participant on the
later of (1) the 91st day following the commencement of his
employment with the Employer (whether as a Qualified Employee or
not), or (2) the day the person first becomes a Qualified Employee.
C. Termination of participation. A Participant shall cease to be a
Participant under this Plan upon the occurrence of a Disqualifying
Event. A Participant shall also cease to be a Participant under this Plan
if he ceases to be a Qualified Employee but continues in the employ of
the Employer. He shall then be a former Participant until all benefits to
which he may be entitled hereunder are paid.
§ 58-17 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-18
1:84
§ 58-19. Benefits: in general.
D. Reemployment of a former participant.
(1) If a person who formerly was a Participant shall again become a
Qualified Employee, and no Disqualifying Event shall have
occurred at or after the time he ceased to be a Participant, he shall
again become a Participant immediately upon becoming a Qualified
Employee.
(2) If a person who formerly was a Participant in this Plan or the South
Whitehall Township Employees' Pension Plan shall again become a
Qualified Employee, and a Disqualifying Event shall have occurred
at or after the time he ceased to be a Participant, he shall be
treated as if he were two different employees - one who was
employed at the earlier time and one who was employed at the later
time. Thus, he shall be treated as an entirely new employee of the
Employer for purposes of any benefits under this Plan related to the
new period of employment, and shall become a Participant again
only under the terms of Subsection B; his benefits for the new
period shall be based solely on Compensation and service during
the new period. However, he shall retain the right to receive all
unpaid vested pension benefits to which he is entitled with respect
to his previous period of employment in accordance with the
pension provisions of the Plan in effect on the last day of the
previous period of employment, without regard to any Plan
amendments enacted thereafter (see § 58-22E) or any
Compensation from or service to the Employer thereafter. Any
benefits payable with respect to the previous period of employment
shall be in addition to any benefits payable with respect to the new
period of employment.
A. Normal retirement benefit. A Participant or former Participant shall be
entitled to receive a normal retirement benefit if he retires from all
employment with the Employer after having attained the age of 65
years and at a time when he has at least seven Years of Vesting Service.
The normal retirement benefit shall be paid in the following form,
unless the Participant or former Participant elects an optional form
under § 58-20: a series of equal monthly payments beginning on the
first day of the month following retirement and ending on the first day
of the month following the month during which the recipient's death
occurs, in an amount equal to 1.5% of his Final Average Monthly
Compensation multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as of
the date of retirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant
who retires from all employment with the Employer on or after
December 1, 2004, and has attained the age of 65 years and has
completed at least seven Years of Vesting Service shall be eligible to
receive a normal retirement benefit in an amount equal to 2% of his
Final Average Monthly Compensation multiplied by his Years of Benefit
Accrual Service as of the date of retirement.
§ 58-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-19
1:85
B. Deferred retirement benefit. If a Participant or former Participant
retires from all employment with the Employer more than one month
after the first date he could have retired under Subsection A (relating to
normal retirement), he shall receive the deferred retirement benefit
rather than the normal retirement benefit if the former is of greater
Equivalent Actuarial Value. The deferred retirement benefit shall be
paid in the following form, unless the Participant or former Participant
elects an optional form under § 58-20: a series of equal monthly
payments beginning on the first day of the month following retirement
and ending on the first day of the month following the month during
which the recipient's death occurs, in an amount such that the deferred
retirement benefit is of Equivalent Actuarial Value to the normal
retirement benefit (determined under § 58-19A) which would have been
payable to the recipient if he had retired on the first date he could have
retired under Subsection A (relating to normal retirement) and not
earned any Compensation from the Employer thereafter.
C. Early retirement benefit. A Participant or former Participant may elect
to receive an early retirement benefit if he retires from all employment
with the Employer when such Participant's or former Participant's
attained age and Years of Vesting Service, when added together, equal
or exceed 80 or more. The early retirement benefit shall be paid in the
following form, unless the Participant or former Participant elects an
optional form under § 58-20: a series of equal monthly payments
beginning on the first day of the month following retirement and ending
on the first day of the month following the month during which the
recipient's death occurs, in an amount equal to 1.5% of his Final
Average Monthly Compensation, multiplied by his Years of Benefit
Accrual Service as of the date of retirement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Participant who retires from all employment with the
Employer on or after December 1, 2004, when such Participant's
attained age and Years of Vesting Service, when added together, equal
or exceed 80 or more, shall be eligible to receive an early retirement
benefit in an amount equal to 2% of his Final Average Monthly
Compensation multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as of
the date of retirement.
D. Disability retirement benefit.
(1) A Participant or former Participant who becomes Disabled may
elect to receive a disability retirement benefit if the condition
which renders him Disabled commences while he is in the employ
of the Employer (whether as a Qualified Employee or otherwise).
The disability retirement benefit shall be paid in a series of equal
monthly payments beginning on the first day of the month following
the month in which the recipient demonstrates to the satisfaction of
the Committee that he is Disabled and ending on the earlier of (a)
the first day of the month following the month during which the
recipient's death occurs, or (2) the first day of the month following
the month during which the recipient ceases to be Disabled. The
§ 58-19 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-19
1:86
amount of each monthly payment shall be such that if the disability
retirement benefit were paid until the death of the recipient, the
disability retirement benefit would be of Equivalent Actuarial Value
to a series of equal monthly payments beginning on the first day
of the month following the later of the month the recipient would
attain age 65 or the month the recipient would first have seven
Years of Vesting Service had he continued in the employ of the
Employer until such time, and continuing until the first day of
the month following the month during which the recipient's death
occurs, in an amount equal to 1.5% of the recipient's Final Average
Monthly Compensation, multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual
Service as of the Qualification Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Participant who becomes disabled on or after
December 1, 2004, shall be eligible to receive a disability
retirement benefit in an amount equal to 2% of his Final Average
Monthly Compensation multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual
Service as of the Qualification Date.
(2) A person shall be ineligible to receive any other benefit under this
Plan during any period in which he is Disabled if he elects to
receive the disability retirement benefit.
(3) If a person who received a Disability Retirement Benefit ceases to
be Disabled and does not immediately thereafter return to the
employ of the Employer, the amount of any benefit the person may
be entitled to receive under this Plan with respect to the period
before he ceased to be Disabled shall be reduced by the Equivalent
Actuarial Value of the disability retirement benefit paid to him.
(4) If a person who received a disability retirement benefit ceases to be
Disabled and immediately thereafter returns to the employ of the
Employer, the amount of any benefit the person may be entitled to
receive under this Plan shall be reduced by the Equivalent
Actuarial Value of the disability retirement benefit paid to him.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if such a person's total
benefits under this Plan would have been greater if he were treated
as having failed to immediately return to the employ of the
Employer after he ceased to be Disabled (so as to suffer a
Disqualifying Event) and as then becoming a new employee of the
Employer upon his return, he shall be so treated.
E. Vested benefit.
(1) In general. A Participant or former Participant who suffers a
Disqualifying Event at a time when he is not eligible to receive a
normal retirement benefit, deferred retirement benefit or early
retirement benefit will be entitled to a vested benefit under this
Plan if he has seven or more Years of Vesting Service as of the date
of the Disqualifying Event. If he has fewer than seven Years of
Vesting Service as of such date, he shall not be entitled to any
§ 58-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-19
1:87
benefits under this Plan for the period covered by those Years of
Vesting Service, except as provided in Subsection G of this § 58-19.
(2) Normal vested benefit. Unless the former Participant makes an
election under Subsection E(3) to receive an early vested benefit, a
former Participant entitled to receive a vested benefit shall receive
his benefit as a normal vested benefit. A normal vested benefit shall
be paid in the following form: equal monthly payments
commencing on the first date a normal retirement benefit (see
Subsection A) could have commenced if the former Participant had
continued in the employ of the Employer until he was entitled to
receive a normal retirement benefit, and continuing until the first
day of the month following the month during which his death
occurs, in an amount equal to 1.5% of his Final Average Monthly
Compensation, multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as
of the date of his Disqualifying Event for a Disqualifying Event that
occurred prior to December 1, 2004, or an amount equal to 2% of
his Final Average Monthly Compensation multiplied by his Years of
Benefit Accrual Service as of the date of his Disqualifying Event for
a Disqualifying Event that occurs on or after December 1, 2004.
(3) Early vested benefit. A former Participant entitled to receive a
vested benefit may elect to receive an early vested benefit rather
than a normal vested benefit under Subsection E(2) at any time
after he attains age 55, provided that he had at least 25 Years of
Vesting Service at the time of his Disqualifying Event. An early
vested benefit shall be paid in the following form: a series of equal
monthly payments beginning on the first day of the second month
following the election and continuing until the first day of the
month following the month during which the recipient's death
occurs, in an amount such that the early vested benefit is of
Equivalent Actuarial Value to the normal vested benefit the
recipient would otherwise have received under Subsection E(2).
(4) Cash-out of vested benefit. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Subsection E(2) and (3), if the Equivalent Actuarial Value of a
former Participant's normal vested benefit is $5,000 or less, the
Committee may pay such Equivalent Actuarial Value to the former
Participant in a lump sum at any time after his Disqualifying Event
in lieu of any normal vested benefit or early vested benefit.
Effective for distributions after March 28, 2005, the Participant
must consent to any distribution under this § 58-19E(4) if the
Equivalent Actuarial Value of the former Participant's normal
vested benefit is greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to
$5,000.
F. Death benefits.
(1) Person eligible for early retirement. If a Participant or former
Participant dies while in the employ of the Employer (whether as a
Qualified Employee or otherwise) at a time when he could have
§ 58-19 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-19
1:88
elected to receive an early retirement benefit (see Subsection C)
but would not have been entitled to a normal retirement benefit
(see Subsection A), benefits shall be paid to his surviving spouse (if
any) as if the Participant or former Participant had retired on the
day before his death, elected on the day before his death to receive
an early retirement benefit in the form of a joint and survivor
annuity (see § 58-20A), and designated his spouse as the contingent
annuitant.
(2) Person eligible for normal retirement. If a Participant or former
Participant dies while in the employ of the Employer (whether as a
Qualified Employee or otherwise) at a time when he could have
retired and received a normal retirement benefit (see Subsection A)
or deferred retirement benefit (see Subsection B), benefits shall be
paid to his designated contingent annuitant (or, if none has been
designated or survives him, his surviving spouse, if any) as if he had
retired on the day before his death and elected to receive his
benefits in the form of a joint and survivor annuity (see § 58-20A).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant or former
Participant had filed an election before his death to receive future
Plan benefits in the ten-year certain form (see § 58-20B), and if any
of his contingent annuitants shall survive him, benefits shall
instead be paid to his contingent annuitants as if he had retired on
the day before his death and elected to receive his benefits in the
ten-year certain form.
(3) Vested employee not eligible for early or normal retirement. If,
after October 1, 1995, a Participant or former Participant dies at a
time when he has credit for at least seven Years of Vesting Service,
but would not have been entitled to elect to receive an early
retirement benefit (see Subsection C) or a normal retirement
benefit (see Subsection A), benefits shall be paid to his surviving
spouse (if any) as follows: a series of equal monthly payments
beginning on the first day of the month following the date the
(former) Participant would have attained the age 55 [or, if the
(former) Participant had already attained age 55 by the time of his
death, beginning on the first day of the month following the date of
the (former) Participant's death], and continuing until the first day
of the month following the month during which the surviving
spouse's death occurs, in an amount equal to the monthly payments
that the surviving spouse would receive as the survivor annuitant
under the following hypothetical annuity:
(a) A joint and survivor annuity in a series of equal monthly
payments commencing on the date the spousal benefits are to
commence under this Subsection F(3), payable to the (former)
Participant throughout his life and payable after his death to
his surviving spouse's death, which is of Equivalent Actuarial
Value to an annuity for the life of the (former) Participant in a
series of equal monthly payments beginning on the first day of
§ 58-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-19
1:89
the month following the month in which the (former)
Participant would have attained age 65 and continuing until
the first day of the month following the month during which
his death occurs, in a monthly amount equal to 1.5% of the
(former) Participant's Final Average Monthly Compensation
with respect to determinations made prior to December 1,
2004, multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as of
the date he actually died, or 2% of the (former) Participant's
Final Average Monthly Compensation with respect to
determinations made on or after December 1, 2004, multiplied
by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as of the date he
actually died. [In calculating the value and amount of the
payments to be made under a life annuity or joint and survivor
annuity, it is necessary to make assumptions about the life
expectancies of the annuitants. Therefore, for purposes of
these hypothetical annuities, the life expectancy of the
(former) Participant at the commencement of these annuities
shall be determined in accordance with the Plan's actuarial
mortality assumptions, without considering the fact that the
(former) Participant has already died. However, once the
amount of benefit payments are calculated under these
annuities, it shall be recognized that the (former) Participant
actually died before payments began, so that all benefits will
be paid to his surviving spouse as the survival annuitant.]
(4) Return of employee contributions.
(a) In general. If no death benefits are payable under Subsection
F(1) through (3) with respect to a Participant or former
Participant as a result of his death (including the situation
where no death benefits are payable thereunder because there
is no surviving spouse or children), and the Participant or
former Participant did not receive any payments from this Plan
under a normal retirement benefit, deferred retirement
benefit, early retirement benefit, disability retirement benefit,
normal vested benefit, early vested benefit, or a return of
employee contributions under Subsection G, below, the Plan
shall pay a benefit to the beneficiary designated by the
Participant or former Participant equal to the amount of all
employee contributions made to the Plan by the Participant or
former Participant under § 58-23A, if any, plus interest. The
payment will be made in a lump sum cash distribution as soon
as practicable after the death of the Participant or former
Participant. If the Participant or former Participant failed to
designate a beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary shall
have survived the Participant or former Participant, the benefit
under this subsection shall be paid to the estate of the
Participant or former Participant.
§ 58-19 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-19
1:90
(b) Interest. For purposes of Subsection F(4)(a), the term
"interest" shall mean interest from the date of contribution to
the date of distribution at the interest rate set forth in the
definition of "Equivalent Actuarial Value" in § 58-16, as
amended from time to time. (If the interest rate is amended,
the interest rate in effect before the amendment shall be
applicable in computing interest for the period before the
effective date of the amendment, and the interest rate in effect
after the amendment shall be applicable in computing interest
for the period after the effective date of the amendment).
(5) No other death benefits. Except as provided in this Subsection F
and in § 58-20 (relating to elections to receive benefits in the form
of a joint and survivor annuity or a ten-year certain form), no
Participant or former Participant, and no estate or beneficiary of
any Participant or former Participant, shall receive any payment or
benefit under this Plan or from the Trust due to the death of a
Participant or former Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
effective January 1, 2007, if a Participant dies while performing
qualified military service [as defined in Section 414(u) of the Code],
the Participant's beneficiary shall be entitled to additional benefits
(including benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified
military service), if any, that would be provided under the Plan had
the Participant resumed employment with the Township and then
terminated employment on account of death.
(6) Beneficiary designations.
(a) Except as provided in Subsection F(6)(b), a Participant or
former Participant may only designate his surviving spouse
and/or one or more of his children as a contingent annuitant
(death beneficiary) of any benefit under this Plan, or any form
of benefit under § 58-20. If there is no surviving spouse or
child, no benefits shall be paid under this Plan after the death
of the Participant or former Participant, other than any benefits
provided under Subsection F(4) of this § 58-19.
(b) For the limited purposes of Subsection F(4) of this § 58-19
(relating to return of employee contributions) only, a
Participant or former Participant may designate any person or
persons as his death beneficiary and may designate both
primary and contingent beneficiaries.
G. Return of employee contributions.
(1) In general. A Participant or former Participant who suffers a
Disqualifying Event at a time when he is not eligible to receive any
benefits under Subsections A through F of this § 58-19, or a
Participant or former Participant who irrevocably waives any and
all benefits under Subsections A through F of this section, will be
entitled to a return of all employee contributions he made to the
§ 58-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-19
1:91
§ 58-20. Optional forms of benefits.
§ 58-21. Limitation on benefits.
Plan under § 58-23A, if any, plus interest. The payment will be
made in a lump sum cash distribution as soon as practicable after
the Participant or former Participant files an election to receive a
return of contributions.
(2) Interest. For purposes of Subsection G(1) the term "interest" shall
mean interest from the date of contribution to the date of
distribution at the interest rate set forth in the definition of
"Equivalent Actuarial Value" in § 58-16, as amended from time to
time. (If the interest rate is amended, the interest rate in effect
before the amendment shall be applicable in computing interest for
the period before the effective date of the amendment, and the
interest rate in effect after the amendment shall be applicable in
computing interest for the period after the effective date of the
amendment).
A. Joint and survivor annuity. A Participant or former Participant entitled
to receive a normal retirement benefit, a deferred retirement benefit or
an early retirement benefit may elect to receive such benefit in the form
of a joint and survivor annuity rather than in the form specified in the
applicable subsection of § 58-19 (life annuity form). A joint and survivor
annuity is a series of equal monthly payments commencing on the date
the life annuity form would commence, payable to the former
Participant throughout his life and payable after his death to his
designated contingent annuitant (if the contingent annuitant shall
survive the former Participant) until the first day of the month of the
contingent annuitant's death, and of Equivalent Actuarial Value to the
life annuity form. For purposes of the joint and survivor annuity option,
only one contingent annuitant may be designated, and only persons
permitted under § 58-19F(6) may be designated.
B. Ten-year certain. A Participant or former Participant entitled to receive
a normal retirement benefit, a deferred retirement benefit or an early
retirement benefit may elect to receive such benefit in the form of a tenyear
certain annuity rather than in the form specified in the applicable
subsection of § 58-19 (life annuity form). A ten-year certain annuity is a
series of equal monthly payments commencing on the date the life
annuity form would commence, payable to the former Participant
throughout his life and, in the event of his death before he receives 120
monthly payments, payable after his death to his designated contingent
annuitants (if living) until a total of 120 monthly payments have been
made to the former Participant and his contingent annuitants, and of
Equivalent Actuarial Value to the life annuity form. For purposes of the
ten-year certain option, only persons permitted under § 58-19F(6) may
be designated as contingent annuitants.
§ 58-19 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-21
1:92
A. Defined benefit dollar limitation. The defined benefit dollar limitation is
$195,000, as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under Code
Section 415(d) in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe, and
payable in the form of a straight life annuity. A limitation as adjusted
under Code Section 415(d) will apply to limitation years ending with or
within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies.
B. Defined benefit compensation limitation. The "defined benefit
compensation limitation" is the Participant's or former Participant's
high three-year average compensation. In the case of a Participant who
has had a severance from employment, the defined benefit
compensation limitation applicable to the Participant in any limitation
year beginning after the date of severance from employment shall be
automatically adjusted by multiplying the limitation applicable to the
Participant in the prior limitation year by the annual adjustment factor
under Code Section 415(d).
C. High three-year average compensation. The average compensation for
the three consecutive calendar years of service with the Employer that
produces the highest average. In the case of a Participant who is
rehired by the Employer after a severance from employment, the
Participant's high three-year average compensation shall be calculated
by excluding all years for which the Participant performs no services for
and receives no compensation from the Employer (the break period)
and by treating the years immediately preceding and following the
break period as consecutive. For purposes of this § 58-21, a
Participant's compensation shall mean wages, within the meaning of
Code Section 3401(a), and all other payments of compensation to an
Employee by the company (in the course of the company's trade or
business) for which the company is required to furnish the Participant a
written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052.
Compensation shall be determined without regard to any rules under
Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages
based on the nature or location of the employment or services
performed. Compensation paid or made available during a limitation
year shall include amounts that would otherwise be included as
compensation but for a Participant's election under Code Sections
125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k) or 457(b). Effective January 1,
2008, and solely for purposes of this § 58-21, compensation shall also
include compensation paid by the later of 2 1/2 months after a
Participant's severance from employment or the end of the calendar
year that includes the date of the Participant's severance from
employment, if the payment is regular compensation for service during
the Participant's regular working hours, or compensation for services
outside the Participant's regular working hours (such as overtime or
shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar payments,
and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have
been paid to the Participant while the Participant continued in
employment with the Employer. Any payments not described above
shall not be considered compensation if paid after severance from
§ 58-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-21
1:93
employment, even if they are paid by the later of 2 1/2 months after
the date of severance from employment or the end of the calendar
year that includes the date of severance from employment. Back pay,
within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be
treated as compensation for the calendar year to which the back pay
relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation
that would otherwise be included under this definition. A Participant's
compensation for a calendar year of service shall not include
compensation in excess of the limitation under Code Section 401(a)(17)
that is in effect for the calendar year in which such year of service
begins.
D. Maximum permissible benefit. The "maximum permissible benefit" is
the lesser of the defined benefit dollar limitation or the defined benefit
compensation limitation (both adjusted where required, as provided in
Subsection E and, if applicable, in Subsections F or G, below).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, when
expressed as a monthly pension in the form of a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits) over the life of a Participant or former
Participant, a pension benefit hereunder shall not exceed the lesser of
(1) the defined benefit dollar limitation divided by 12, or (2) 100% of the
participants monthly defined benefit compensation limitation. The
maximum shall apply to any pension payable to the Participant or
former Participant as a joint and survivor annuity without any actuarial
reduction.
E. If the participant has fewer than 10 years of participation in the plan,
the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of
participation in the plan, and the denominator of which is 10. In the
case of a participant who has fewer than 10 years of service with the
employer, the defined benefit compensation limitation shall be
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years
(or part thereof) of service with the employer, and the denominator of
which is 10.
F. If the benefit of a participant begins prior to age 62, the defined benefit
dollar limitation applicable to the participant at such earlier age is an
annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at
the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit
dollar limitation applicable to the participant at age 62 (adjusted under
Subsection D above, if required). The defined benefit dollar limitation
applicable at an age prior to age 62 is computed using a 5% interest
rate and the applicable mortality table as defined in Rev. Rul. 2001-62
or, for distributions prior to January 1, 2008, computed using the
interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in
the definition of "Equivalent Actuarial Value" in § 58-16 of the Plan if
lesser. Any decrease in the defined benefit dollar limitation determined
in accordance with this Subsection F shall not reflect a mortality
decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the
§ 58-21 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-21
1:94
§ 58-22. Benefits: miscellaneous provisions.
participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality
decrement is taken into account.
G. If the benefit of a participant begins after the participant attains age 65,
the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the participant at the
later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life
annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the
defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the participant at age 65
(adjusted under Subsection D above, if required). The actuarial
equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age
after age 65 is computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the
applicable mortality table as defined in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 or, for
distributions prior to January 1, 2008, computed using the interest rate
and mortality table (or other tabular factor), specified in the definition
of "Equivalent Actuarial Value" in § 58-16, of the Plan if lesser. For these
purposes, mortality between age 65 and the age at which benefits
commence shall be ignored.
H. For all purposes of this Plan, the maximum defined benefit dollar
limitation shall be automatically increased as permitted by Treasury
Department regulations to reflect cost-of-living adjustments. As a result
of such an adjustment, a pension which had been limited by the
provisions of this § 58-21 in a previous plan year may be increased with
respect to future payments to the lesser of the adjusted defined benefit
dollar limitation amount or the amount of pension which would have
been payable under this Plan without regard to the provisions of this
§ 58-21.
I. The limitations described in this § 58-21 are intended to comply with
the provisions of Code Section 415, as amended, so that the maximum
benefits provided by plans of the Employer shall be exactly equal to the
maximum amounts allowed under Code Section 415 and the regulations
issued thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of
this § 58-21 and the provisions of Code Section 415 and the regulations
issued thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as
to give full effect to the provisions of Code Section 415 and the
regulations issued thereunder.
A. Accrued benefit.
(1) The accrued benefit as of any given date ("calculation date") of a
Participant or former Participant who has never suffered a
Disqualifying Event or who has returned to employment with the
Employer since his most recent Disqualifying Event, and who is not
yet qualified to receive any Plan benefits with respect to his current
period of employment if he terminates his employment with the
Employer, shall be an amount equal to:
§ 58-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-22
1:95
(a) The Equivalent Actuarial Value as of the calculation date of an
annuity of equal monthly payments commencing on the first
date a normal retirement benefit would commence if the
Participant or former Participant continues in the employ of the
Employer until he is entitled to receive a normal retirement
benefit with respect to his current period of employment, and
continuing until the first day of the month following his death,
in an amount equal to 1.5% of his Final Average Monthly
Compensation, multiplied by his number of Years of Benefit
Accrual Service as of a calculation date prior to December 1,
2004, and 2% of his Final Average Monthly Compensation
multiplied by his number of Years of Benefit Accrual Service as
of a calculation date after December 1, 2004; plus
(b) The Equivalent Actuarial Value as of the calculation date of all
Plan benefits to which the Participant or former Participant is
entitled for periods of service ending on or before the date of
any Disqualifying Event which occurred before the calculation
date; less
(c) The Equivalent Actuarial Value of all Plan benefits which have
already been paid.
(2) The accrued benefit as of any given date ("calculation date") of a
Participant or former Participant other than a person described in
Subsection A(1) shall be an amount equal to the Equivalent
Actuarial Value as of the calculation date of all Plan benefits which
the Participant or former Participant is entitled to receive at any
time, assuming for such purposes that any such Participant or
former Participant who has never suffered a Disqualifying Event or
who has returned to employment with the Employer since his most
recent Disqualifying Event terminates his employment with the
Employer on the calculation date, less the Equivalent Actuarial
Value of all Plan benefits which have already been paid.
B. Production of information. Before any payment shall be made under this
Plan to or on account of a Participant or former Participant, the
recipient of such payment shall file with or make available to the
Committee such information as the Committee may from time to time
require to determine the recipient's rights and benefits under the Plan.
C. Notice of benefit options. The Committee shall provide a Participant or
former Participant with written notice of the benefit options which are
available to him under the Plan and of the procedures for obtaining
such benefits within a reasonable time after the Participant or former
Participant expresses an interest in retirement, and also approximately
three months before the Participant or former Participant would first
become eligible to receive a normal retirement benefit.
D. Election of benefits and benefit options. All applications for benefit
payments, elections to receive optional forms of benefits, and
§ 58-22 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-22
1:96
beneficiary (contingent annuitant) designations shall be made on forms
supplied by the Committee and within such reasonable periods of time
as may be prescribed by the Committee. The time provided in this Plan
for the commencement of any benefits shall be subject to compliance
with the requirements of Subsection B and this Subsection D
E. No benefit increases following termination. The amount of benefits to
which a Participant or former Participant may be entitled under this
Plan with respect to any continuous period of employment with the
Employer (whether as a Qualified Employee or not) or any consecutive
periods of employment in which a Disqualifying Event has not occurred
between the beginning of the first of such periods and the day before
the end of the last of such periods, shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Plan in effect on the last day in which the
Participant or former Participant worked for the Employer during such
period or during the last of such consecutive periods. Such amount
shall not be affected by benefit increases which become effective
thereafter.
F. Latest commencement of benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Plan, distribution of benefits under this Plan with
respect to any Participant or former Participant shall commence no
later than the later of:
(1) April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which
the Participant or former Participant attains age 70 1/2; or
(2) April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which
the Participant or former Participant ceases to be employed by the
Employer.
G. Compliance with Code Section 401(a)(9). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Plan, all distributions of Plan benefits
must comply with the provisions of Code Section 401(a)(9) (or any
successor provision) and the regulations issued thereunder, and the
incidental death benefit rules of the Internal Revenue Service. If a form
of benefits (including the selection of a beneficiary/contingent
annuitant) elected by a Participant or former Participant would violate
those provisions, regulations or rules, but another form is available
under the terms of this Plan which would not, the Participant or former
Participant must elect a form which would not violate those provisions,
regulations or rules. Otherwise, the optional forms of benefits available
under this Plan shall be modified as follows, to the extent necessary to
comply with those provisions, regulations and rules:
(1) A joint and survivor annuity form may be altered by reducing the
monthly amount under the survivor annuity below 100% of the
monthly amount paid during the former Participant's life;
(2) A ten-year certain form may be altered by reducing the duration of
the period certain.

H. Direct rollover.
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that
would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by
the Administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution that is equal to at least $500 paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
(2) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee,
except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:
any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of
10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); the
portion of any other distribution that is not includible in gross
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities);
any hardship distribution described in Code Section
401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) made after December 31, 1999; and any
other distribution that is reasonably expected to total less than
$200 during a year. Effective January 1, 2002, a portion of a
distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution
merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee
contributions which are not includible in gross income;
provided, however, such portion may be transferred only to (i)
an individual retirement account or annuity described in
Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code; (ii) for taxable years
beginning before January 1, 2007, a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the
Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution that is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution that is not so includible; or (iii) for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, a qualified
trust or to an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of
the Code if such trust or contract provides for separate
accounting for amounts so transferred (including interest
thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution which is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
(b) An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement
account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual
retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an
§ 58-22 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-22
1:98
§ 58-23. Employer and employee contributions.
annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), or a qualified
trust described in Code Section 401(a), that accepts the
distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case
of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an
"eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account
or individual retirement annuity. Effective for distributions
made after December 31, 2001, an "eligible retirement plan"
shall also mean an annuity contract described in Code Section
403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which
is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any
agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of
a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts
transferred into such plan from this Plan. Effective for
distributions made after December 31, 2001, an "eligible
retirement plan" shall also apply in the case of a distribution to
a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the
alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as
defined in Code Section 414(p). Effective January 1, 2008, an
eligible retirement plan shall also mean a Roth IRA described
in Code Section 408A.
(c) A "distributee" includes an Employee or former Employee. In
addition, the Employee's or former Employee's surviving
spouse and the Employee's or former Employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p),
are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
former spouse. Effective for distributions made on or after
January 1, 2010, "distributee" shall also mean the Employee's
nonspouse designated beneficiary; provided, however, that the
direct rollover for a nonspouse designated beneficiary may be
made only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Code Sections 408(a) or 408(b) that is established
on behalf of the Employee's nonspouse designated beneficiary
and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the
provisions of Code Section 402(c)(11).
(d) A "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
A. Employee contributions. From January 1, 1994, to January 1, 1997,
each Participant contributed an amount equal to 1% of his
Compensation to the Trust. The contributions under this Subsection A
shall be paid by having the Employer pay each Participant only 99% of
the amount of Compensation he/she would otherwise receive in each
paycheck. Although all contributions under this Subsection A are
hereby designated as employee contributions, they shall be made
through salary reductions and thus paid by the Employer as "pick up"
§ 58-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-23
1:99
§ 58-24. Administration and management of Plan and Trust.
contributions under Code Section 414(h)(2) so that they are not subject
to federal income tax at the time of contribution, but only when Plan
benefits are paid. (Note: although pick up contributions are not subject
to current federal income tax, they are considered "wages" subject to
current FICA taxation and also current income for Pennsylvania state
and local income taxes.) A Qualified Employee shall not have the option
of receiving the amount of employee contributions required under this
Subsection A directly instead of having them paid by the Employer to
the Plan. This subsection shall be construed to include all requirements
necessary to satisfy the provisions of Code Section 414(h)(2).
B. Employee contributions — military service. Notwithstanding
Subsection A, no Participant shall be required to make any
contributions to this Plan during any period of service in the uniformed
services of the United States. If such a Participant returns to
employment with the Employer, he/she shall contribute to the Plan an
amount equal to the rate in effect under Subsection A for the period of
uniformed service multiplied by the deemed Compensation of the
Participant for such period. (Where more than one rate is in effect
during the period of uniformed service, a calculation shall be performed
for each portion of the period of uniformed service governed by a
separate rate, and the total required contribution shall be equal to the
sum of such calculations). The contribution shall be made during the
period beginning with the date of reemployment and whose duration is
the lesser of (1) three times the period of the person's service in the
uniformed services, or (2) five years. If the Participant fails or refuses to
make the contribution required under this Subsection B, he shall forfeit
all benefits under this Plan which are based on service during the
period for which the required employee contributions were not made.
C. Employer contributions. The Employer shall, from time to time,
contribute to the Plan and Trust the amounts required to fund all the
benefits provided under the Plan according to the calculations of the
Pension Consultant, and as required by the Municipal Pension Plan
Funding Standard and Recovery Act, 53 P.S. § 895.101 et seq. Employer
contributions may be derived from grants of state aid, disbursements
from the Township's general fund, and other sources.
D. Payment of contributions to trustee. All Employer contributions shall be
paid to the Trustee to be held in the Trust. The Trust shall be used to
pay all benefits under this Plan. Contributions under Subsection A shall
be paid to the Trustee no later than 60 days after the date they would
otherwise have been paid as Compensation to the Participant.
A. Administrative Committee.
(1) The South Whitehall Township Pension Committee shall administer
the South Whitehall Township Office Personnel Pension Plan, the
South Whitehall Township Public Works Union Employees’ Pension
§ 58-23 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-24
1:100
Plan, and the South Whitehall Township Police Pension Plan and
Trust. The Committee shall consist of a minimum of three persons
and a maximum of seven persons. The members of the Committee
shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Commissioners, with
appointments to the Committee being made by resolution of the
Board of Commissioners from time to time. Any member of the
Committee may resign by delivering his written resignation to the
Commissioners and to the Committee. [Amended 10-17-2012 by
Ord. No. 961]
(2) Organization and operation of the Committee. A majority of the
appointed members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for
all actions taken by the Committee. Any such action may be taken
either by vote at a meeting or in writing without a meeting. The
Committee may authorize any one or more of its members to
execute any document or documents on behalf of the Committee, in
which event the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of
such action and the name or names of its member or members so
designated. Thereafter, the Trustee shall accept and rely upon any
document executed by such member or members as representing
action by the Committee until the Committee shall file with the
Trustee a written revocation of such designation. The Committee
may adopt such by-laws and regulations as it deems desirable for
the conduct of its affairs, and may appoint such accountants,
consultants, and other persons as it may deem necessary or
desirable in connection with the administration of this Plan. The
Committee shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon, and shall be
fully protected in any action taken by it in good faith in relying
upon, any opinions or reports which shall be furnished to it by any
such accountant, counsel or other consultants.
(3) Powers and duties. The Committee shall administer the Plan in
accordance with its terms, shall direct the Trustee to make the
benefit payments provided under this Plan, and shall have all
powers necessary to carry out the provisions of the Plan. The
Committee shall interpret the Plan and shall determine all
questions arising in the administration, interpretation, and
application of the Plan. Any such determination by the Committee
shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
(4) Records and reports. The Committee shall keep a record of all its
proceedings and acts, and shall keep all such books of account,
records, and other data as may be necessary for the proper
administration of the Plan. The Committee shall notify the Trustee
and the Employer of any action taken by the Committee and, when
required, shall notify any other interested person or persons.
(5) Payment of expenses. Unless otherwise determined by the
Commissioners, the members of the Committee shall serve without
compensation for services as such, but all expenses of the
Committee shall be paid by the Trust or the Employer in such
§ 58-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-24
1:101
manner as the Employer shall determine. Such expenses shall
include any expenses incident to the functioning of the Committee,
including but not limited to fees of accountants, counsel,
consultants and other specialists, and any other costs of
administering the Plan.
(6) Immunity from liability; indemnification. No member of the
Committee shall incur any liability for any action or failure to act
except with respect to his own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Employer shall and does hereby indemnify each
member of the Committee against any and all claims, losses,
damages, expenses and liabilities arising from any action or failure
to act, except when the same is judicially determined to be due to
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such member. In
addition, the Committee and any member or agent thereof shall be
fully protected in relying upon the advice of any counsel, consultant
or actuary appointed by the Committee or the Employer.
B. The trust.
(1) In general. All of the funds of this Plan shall be held by a corporate
trustee or trustees appointed by the Commissioners, in trust, in
accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, as it may be
amended from time to time. Said Trust Agreement is incorporated
herein by reference. The Trust created or existing under the Trust
Agreement shall be a part of this Plan for use in providing the
benefits of this Plan and paying any expenses not directly paid by
the Employer. Neither the Employer, the Committee, nor the
Commissioners shall have any responsibility for the administration
of the Trust funds or any liability for any loss with respect thereto.
(2) Rights in Trust funds. No part of the corpus or income of the Trust
shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive
benefit of Participants, former Participants, and contingent
annuitants of this Plan prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities
under this Plan with respect to such persons. No person shall have
any interest in or right to any part of the earnings or assets of the
Trust except as and to the extent expressly provided in this Plan
and in the Trust Agreement.
(3) Source of Plan benefits. The Trust is designed to be and shall be the
sole source of the benefits provided under the Plan. The Employer
does not guarantee such benefits or payments or assume any
obligation with respect thereto other than to pay the contributions
provided under § 58-23 into the Trust.
(4) Trustee. The Commissioners hereby reaffirm the appointment of
Wells Fargo Bank as Trustee of the Trust.
(5) No funding by individual policies. The Plan shall not be funded on
an individual insurance policy basis.
§ 58-24 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-24
1:102
§ 58-25. Amendment.
C. Pension Consultant. The Commissioners hereby appoint Conrad Siegel
Actuaries as the Pension Consultant to the Plan and Trust to serve at
the pleasure of the Commissioners.
D. Nondiscrimination. Whenever there is a choice or decision to be made
by the Employer or the Committee in connection with the
administration of the Plan, the result shall be uniformly applied then
and thereafter in all similar circumstances so that there shall be no
discrimination in the operation of the Plan.
A. The Commissioners may by ordinance at any time and from time to time
modify or amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the
Plan and/or Trust Agreement, including the method of financing the
Plan, provided that:
(1) No modification or amendment may be made which would have the
effect of depriving any retired former Participant or contingent
annuitant receiving a retirement benefit of any benefits under the
Plan to which he would otherwise be entitled by reason of the
accumulated funds held under the Plan at that time, unless such
former Participant or contingent annuitant consents thereto;
(2) No modification or amendment may be made which would cause
the accrued benefit (see § 58-22A) of any Participant or former
Participant to be lower at any time after the modification or
amendment than it was immediately before the amendment, except
that any portion of the accrued benefit which is attributable to a
nonvested period may be reduced or eliminated as of any date after
the end of such period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a
"nonvested period" shall mean any period of time ending with a
Disqualifying Event and beginning the day after the previous
Disqualifying Event (or, in the case of the period which ends with
the first Disqualifying Event suffered by the Participant or former
Participant, beginning the first day of employment with the
Employer), provided that the Participant or former Participant had
less than seven Years of Vesting Service as of the last day of the
period;
(3) No modification or amendment may be made which would increase
the number of years specified in § 58-19E(1) to qualify for the
vested benefit, or would otherwise change the vesting schedule of
the Plan (currently 0% for six or fewer Years of Vesting Service and
100% for seven or more Years of Vesting Service) to the potential
detriment of any Participant;
(4) No such modification or amendment shall make it possible for any
part of the funds of the Plan to be used for or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants, former
§ 58-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-25
1:103
§ 58-26. Termination and merger.
Participants, and contingent annuitants under the Plan prior to the
satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to them; and
(5) No such modification or amendment shall make it possible for the
Employer to appoint to the position of Trustee anyone other than a
corporate trustee.
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any modifications or amendments of
the Plan may be made by ordinance, retroactively if necessary, which
the Commissioners may deem necessary or appropriate to make the
Plan conform to the requirements of any law or governmental
regulation now or hereafter enacted or promulgated, or to qualify the
Plan and Trust as exempt under existing or future federal, state or local
income tax or estate tax laws and regulations.
A. Right of termination. Although the Employer expects and desires that
this Plan shall be permanent, it reserves the right to terminate the Plan
for any reason at any time and discontinue contributions to this Plan, to
the extent permitted by state and federal law.
B. Use of funds upon termination. In case of termination of this Plan, all
active Participants who are accruing benefits shall become fully vested
in their accrued benefits and the funds of the Plan and Trust shall be
used for the exclusive benefit of Participants, former Participants, and
contingent annuitants to the extent of their rights under the Plan.
However, if the Employer, because of erroneous actuarial calculations,
shall have contributed funds in excess of the amount required to satisfy
all liabilities of the Plan for benefits, then such excess shall be returned
to the Employer.
C. Order of payments. In the event this Plan is terminated or the Employer
discontinues making contributions to this Plan, the Committee shall
determine the share of the funds of the Plan and Trust allocable to each
Participant, former Participant, and contingent annuitant in the
following order, except as may be required by rule, regulation or
direction of the Internal Revenue Service, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, or the Pennsylvania Auditor General's office:
(1) Any accrued benefits (see § 58-22A) that Participants, former
Participants or contingent annuitants have accrued to the date of
termination or discontinuance of contributions, to the extent that
these benefits are then funded or credited to their individual
accounts, shall be nonforfeitable and payable to them. If the funds
of the Plan are insufficient to provide for all accrued benefits in full,
each benefit shall be reduced pro rata.
(2) To the extent that such accrued benefits are not funded or credited
on an individual basis, they shall be payable in the following order:
§ 58-25 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-26
1:104
§ 58-27. Miscellaneous provisions.
(a) Each retired former Participant or his contingent annuitant
receiving a retirement benefit and each Participant or former
Participant who has not yet retired from employment with the
Employer but who is entitled to retire and receive a normal
retirement benefit shall be entitled to a benefit equal to the
reserve computed to be required to provide his full accrued
benefits. If the funds of the Plan and Trust are insufficient to
provide in full for all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(a),
then all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(a) shall be reduced
pro rata.
(b) After the benefits under the provisions of Subsection C(2)(a)
above have been set aside in full, each other person entitled to
a benefit hereunder shall be entitled to a benefit equal to the
reserve computed to be required to provide his accrued
benefits. If the funds of the Plan and Trust are insufficient to
prove in full for all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(b), then
all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(b) shall be reduced pro
rata.
D. Form of termination payments. To the extent permitted by law, the
Committee may require that all assets of the Trust be paid following the
termination of the Plan (or the complete discontinuance of Employer
contributions to the Plan) in cash, in immediate annuities, in deferred
annuities, or in other periodic payment forms, or in one of such forms
permitted by the Committee and elected by the recipient.
E. Merger.
(1) For purposes of this Subsection E, the term "merger" shall mean
any merger or consolidation of this Plan and/or the Trust with any
other plan, or any transfer of the assets or liabilities of this Plan
and/or the Trust to any other plan.
(2) The terms of any merger must specify that if this Plan or its
successor were to terminate immediately after the merger, each
Participant and former Participant shall receive a benefit which is
not less than he would have received in the event this Plan
terminated immediately before such merger.
A. No other legal rights conferred by plan. The establishment and
maintenance of this Plan shall not be construed as conferring any legal
rights upon employees or other persons to a continuation of
employment with the Employer nor shall it interfere with the rights of
the Employer to discharge any person or to treat him without regard to
the effect which such treatment might have upon him as a Participant
or former Participant in the Plan.
§ 58-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-27
1:105
B. Spendthrift provisions. No benefit under this Plan shall be subject in
any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,
pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to do so shall be void,
except as specifically provided in this Plan, nor shall any such benefit be
in any manner liable for or subject to garnishment, attachment,
execution, levy or other legal process for the collection of debts, or
liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or
torts of the person entitled to such benefit. In the event the Committee
shall find that any Participant, former Participant, or contingent
annuitant under this Plan has become incompetent, bankrupt or
insolvent, or that any attempt has been made to anticipate, alienate,
sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any of his benefits
under the Plan, except as specifically provided in the Plan, then such
benefit shall cease and terminate and in such event the Committee and
the Trustee shall hold or apply the same to or for the benefit of such
Participant, former Participant, or contingent annuitant, his spouse,
children or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner as the
Committee may find proper from time to time.
C. Right to inspect documents. Notwithstanding any information that is
made available by the Employer, Committee or Trustee to any person
through the distribution of descriptive booklets, bulletin board notices,
payroll notices, or oral announcements, any Participant or former
Participant may examine the Plan as presented in this article and
amendments thereto, and the Trust Agreement and all amendments
thereto, at the main office of the Employer at such mutually convenient
time as is arranged by the Participant or former Participant and a
representative of the Employer, Committee or Trustee.
D. Construction. When used herein, the masculine shall include the
feminine and neuter, as appropriate.
E. Governing law. This Plan shall be construed, regulated and
administered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
the applicable laws of the United States of America.

ARTICLE IV
Police Pension Plan
[Adopted 12-17-2003 by Ord. No. 787; amended in its entirety
5-19-2010 by Ord. No. 913]
§ 58-28. Continuation of plan.
The Commissioners of the Township of South Whitehall established a
pension plan and trust fund for its police officers by Ordinance No. 149,
enacted June 14, 1971. The plan and trust have been amended from time
to time thereafter. Effective as of January 1, 2010, the Commissioners
hereby continue said plan as the "South Whitehall Township Police Pension
Plan" and amend and restate it in its entirety. The pension benefits of any
participant who terminated his employment with the Township prior to
January 1, 2010, shall be determined solely under the provisions of the plan
in effect at the time of his termination.
§ 58-29. Definitions.
When used in §§ 58-28 through 58-43, with initial capital letters, the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless a different
meaning is plainly required by the context:
ANNIVERSARY DATE — Each January 1.
ATTENDING COLLEGE — The eligible child or children of a Participant is
or are registered at an accredited institution of higher learning and are
carrying a minimum course load of seven credit hours per semester.
COMMISSIONERS — The Board of Commissioners of the Township of South
Whitehall.
COMMITTEE — The committee appointed by the Commissioners under
§ 58-40 to administer the Plan.
COMPENSATION — Of an employee for a given year (or other period
for which a determination is being made), the amount of Compensation
actually paid, made available, or includible in gross income for the year
(or other determination period). [In the case of a period during which
an employee is serving in the uniformed forces of the United States, or
during the term of any other approved leave of absence, the employee's
Compensation shall be computed (A) at the rate the employee would have
received but for the uniformed service or other leave of absence, or (B)
in the case that the determination of such rate is not reasonably certain,
on the basis of the employee's average rate of compensation during the
twelve-month period immediately preceding the period of uniformed service
or leave of absence (or, if shorter, the period of employment immediately
preceding such period)]. However, Compensation shall not include any
compensation in excess of the amount in effect for such year under Section
401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
If Compensation is ever required to be determined for a period of time
which contains fewer than 12 months, the amount in effect for such period
§ 58-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-29
1:107
under Code Section 401(a)(17) shall be equal to the amount in effect under
Code Section 401(a)(17) for the calendar year in which the period begins,
multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is equal to the number of months
in the period, and whose denominator is 12.
DISABLED — A person shall be considered "Disabled" if he has a physical
or mental condition which renders him permanently and totally disabled
from substantially performing police work for the Employer due to injuries
incurred while performing police duties for the Employer, and such
condition is established by a licensed physician satisfactory to the
Committee.
DISQUALIFYING EVENT — With respect to any given person, each of the
following shall be a "Disqualifying Event":
DROP PROGRAM — The Deferred Retirement Option Program as reflected
in the Articles of Agreement between Police Services of South Whitehall
Township and the Board of Commissioners of South Whitehall Township
dated as of December 20, 2006 (for the period January 1, 2006, through
December 31, 2007), and the Arbitration Award between South Whitehall
Police Bargaining Unit and South Whitehall Township (for the period May 1,
2009, through October 31, 2011), which program permits a Participant who
has met the age and service requirements of § 58-32 of the Plan to become a
former Participant but continue in active employment with the Employer for
up to four years. From the period of time a Participant enters into the DROP
Program until the person ceases active employment with the Employer,
such Participant's normal retirement benefit shall be segregated within
the Plan without interest for the former Participant's benefit upon ceasing
active employment with the Employer. During the period of time a former
The voluntary or involuntary termination of the person's employment
with the Employer, unless the termination occurs due to the
conscription, enlistment or appointment of the person to service in the
Armed Forces of the United States, or because of a condition which
renders the person Disabled. However, if the Employer shall terminate
the person's employment due to insufficient work for such person or
shall indicate that the termination is temporary, such termination shall
be considered a "layoff" and not a "termination" unless the layoff
continues for a period in excess of six months. The mere cessation
of a person's status as a Qualified Employee shall not constitute a
"termination" under this subsection; only a termination from all
employment with the Employer shall be a "termination";
A.
The person's failure to return to work at the end of any leave of
absence, after ceasing to be Disabled, or upon recall following a layoff;
B.
The lapse of the person's right under the then-effective laws of the
United States to reinstatement of employment with the Employer
following a period of service with the Armed Forces of the United
States, unless the person was reinstated before such lapse; or the
failure of the person to qualify for reinstatement rights following a
period of service with the Armed Forces of the United States.
C.

Participant participates in the DROP Program, the former Participant shall
not be classified as a Qualified Employee under the Plan and shall not
accrue Years of Vesting Service or Years of Benefit Accrual Service under

may be credited for each month of preemployment military service in
accordance with the following:
(1) In addition to the benefit accrual service credited under Subsection
B, one month of preemployment military service shall be credited
to the person for each month of preemployment military service
purchased by the person during an election period [as described in
Subsection C(4)] and purchased on or before the determination
date.
(2) A person may purchase credit for a month of preemployment
military service for any one-month period in which he was in fulltime
military service of the United States. Any such period must
have been prior to the date the person was first employed by the
§ 58-30 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-30
1:112
§ 58-31. Participation.
Employer, and no period of time may be used more than once under
this subsection. No person may purchase more than a total of 60
months of preemployment military service. No period of military
service may be used for purchase of preemployment military
service (and, if purchased, no such benefit accrual service will be
credited) if the person is entitled to receive, eligible to receive now
or in the future, or is receiving retirement benefits for such service
under a retirement system administered and wholly or partially
paid for by any other governmental agency with the exception of
a member eligible to receive or receiving military retirement pay
earned by a combination of active duty and nonactive duty with
a reserve or national guard component of the armed forces which
retirement pay is payable only upon the attainment of a specified
age and period of service under 10 U.S.C. Ch. 67 (relating to retired
pay for nonregular service).
(3) The purchase price for each month of preemployment military
service shall be equal to:

purchase; or
[2] Ten percent; multiplied by:
(b) The person's total Compensation for the first three years of his
employment with the Employer (from first date of employment
until the third anniversary of that date) divided by three; plus
(c) Interest on the product of Subsection C(3)(a) and (b) at the
rate of 4.75% compounded annually from the date the person
commenced employment with the Employer to the date of
purchase (i.e., the date payment is made).
(4) For purposes of this Subsection C, the term "election period" shall
mean November 24, 1993, through December 31, 1994.
A. Continuing participants. All persons who are Qualified Employees on
January 1, 2010, and were members of or participants in the Plan
immediately before that date shall continue as Participants under this
Plan as of January 1, 2010.
B. New participants. A present or future employee of the Employer other
than one described in Subsection A shall become a Participant on the
later of (1) the first Anniversary Date following the commencement of
his employment with the Employer (whether as a Qualified Employee or
not), or (2) the day the person first becomes a Qualified Employee.
§ 58-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-31
1:113
§ 58-32. Normal retirement benefits.
A Participant or former Participant shall be entitled to receive a normal
retirement benefit if he retires from all employment with the Employer or
enters the DROP Program after having attained the age of 50 years and
at a time when he has at least 25 Years of Benefit Accrual Service. The
normal retirement benefit shall be paid in the following form: a series of
equal monthly payments beginning on the first day of the month following
retirement and ending on the first day of the month following the month
during which the recipient's death occurs, in an amount equal to 50% of
his Final Average Monthly Compensation. No actuarial adjustment shall
be made to the amount of the normal retirement benefit if the Participant
defers retirement beyond the first day he is entitled to retire with a normal
retirement benefit (except that Final Average Monthly Compensation shall
still be based on the last months of actual employment as a Qualified
Employee, not the last months before the earliest normal retirement date),
C. Termination of participation. A Participant shall cease to be a
Participant under this Plan upon the occurrence of a Disqualifying
Event. A Participant shall also cease to be a Participant under this Plan
if he ceases to be a Qualified Employee but continues in the employ of
the Employer. He shall then be a former Participant until all benefits to
which he may be entitled hereunder are paid.
D. Reemployment of a former Participant.
(1) If a person who formerly was a Participant shall again become a
Qualified Employee, and no Disqualifying Event shall have
occurred at or after the time he ceased to be a Participant, he shall
again become a Participant immediately upon becoming a Qualified
Employee.
(2) If a person who formerly was a Participant in this Plan shall again
become a Qualified Employee, and a Disqualifying Event shall have
occurred at or after the time he ceased to be a Participant, he shall
be treated as if he were two different employees - one who was
employed at the earlier time and one who was employed at the later
time. Thus, he shall be treated as an entirely new employee of the
Employer for purposes of any benefits under this Plan related to the
new period of employment, and shall become a Participant again
only under the terms of Subsection B; his benefits for the new
period shall be based solely on Compensation and service during
the new period. However, he shall retain the right to receive all
unpaid pension benefits to which he is entitled with respect to his
previous period of employment in accordance with the pension
provisions in effect on the last day of the previous period of
employment, without regard to any Plan amendments enacted
thereafter (see § 58-37D) or any Compensation from or service to
the Employer thereafter. Any benefits payable with respect to the
previous period of employment shall be in addition to any benefits
payable with respect to the new period of employment.
§ 58-31 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-32
1:114
and no benefits shall be paid before actual retirement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, effective January 1, 2006, if a Participant retires from all
employment with the Employer and is entitled receive a normal retirement
benefit, such Participant shall receive a monthly service increment of $100
per month for each Year of Benefit Accrual Service in excess of 25; provided,
however, that the payment of such service increments shall not exceed $400
per month after completing four Years of Benefit Accrual Service in excess
of 25.
§ 58-33. Disability benefits.
A. In general. A Participant or former Participant who becomes Disabled
may elect to receive a disability benefit. The disability benefit shall be
paid in a series of equal monthly payments beginning on the first day of
the month following the month in which the recipient demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the Committee that he is Disabled and ending on the
earlier of the first day of the month following the month during which
the recipient's death occurs or the first day of the month following the
month during which the recipient ceases to be Disabled. In the event of
Disability, benefits shall become payable to an injured police officer in
equal monthly installments in an amount equal to 50% of the
Participant's Salary at the time the Disability was incurred reduced by
any monthly social security disability benefits received by the
Participant as a result of the Disability. The monthly Disability benefits
shall begin the first month following the month in which the officer is
honorably discharged as a result of the disability.
B. Other benefits. A person shall be ineligible to receive any other benefit
under this Plan during any period in which he is Disabled if he elects to
receive the disability retirement benefit.
C. Recovery of disabled employee: does not return to employment. If a
person who received a disability retirement benefit ceases to be
Disabled and does not immediately thereafter return to the employ of
the Employer, the amount of any benefit the person may be entitled to
receive under this Plan with respect to the period before he ceased to
be Disabled shall be reduced by the Equivalent Actuarial Value of the
disability retirement benefit paid to him.
D. Recovery of disabled employee: returns to employment. If a person who
received a disability retirement benefit ceases to be Disabled and
immediately thereafter returns to the employ of the Employer, the
amount of any benefit the person may be entitled to receive under this
Plan shall be reduced by the Equivalent Actuarial Value of the disability
retirement benefit paid to him. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, if such a person's total benefits under this Plan would have
been greater if he were treated as having failed to immediately return
to the employ of the Employer after he ceased to be Disabled (so as to
suffer a Disqualifying Event) and as then becoming a new employee of
the Employer upon his return, he shall be so treated.
§ 58-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-33
1:115
§ 58-34. Benefits upon termination before retirement.
E. Death benefit. Effective as of April 17, 2002, if a Participant dies after
sustaining a Disability, the surviving spouse of such member, including
surviving spouses whose spouse died on or before April 17, 2002, and
who were not remarried as of such date, shall receive a pension
calculated at 50% of the salary of the Participant at the time of his
death. If there is no surviving spouse or the spouse subsequently dies,
the child or children of the deceased Participant shall share equally in a
pension calculated at 50% of the salary the Participant at the time of his
death until each reach the age of 18 years, or if Attending College, until
each such child is under or attaining the age of 23.
A. Vested benefit.
(1) In general. A Participant or former Participant who suffers a
Disqualifying Event at a time when he is not eligible to receive a
normal retirement benefit will be entitled to a vested benefit under
this Plan if he has 12 or more Years of Vesting Service as of the date
of the Disqualifying Event, provided he complies with the
provisions of Subsection A(3).
(2) Vested benefit. The vested benefit shall be paid in the following
form: a series of equal monthly payments beginning the first date a
normal retirement benefit (see § 58-32) could have commenced if
the former Participant had continued in the employ of the Employer
as a Qualified Employee from the last day that he was a Qualified
Employee until the first day he would have been entitled to retire
and receive a normal retirement benefit (or, if later, commencing
the first day of the month following retirement from all employment
with the Employer), and continuing until the first day of the month
following the month during which the recipient's death occurs, in
an amount equal to 50% of his Final Average Monthly
Compensation multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as of the date of the
Disqualifying Event, and the denominator of which is the number of
Years of Benefit Accrual Service he would have completed as of his
retirement date if he had continued to work as a Qualified
Employee from the last day that he was a Qualified Employee until
the first day he would have been entitled to retire and receive a
normal retirement benefit under § 58-32.
(3) Procedure. In order to be able to receive the vested benefit, the
Participant or former Participant must elect to vest his benefits and
waive a return of contributions under Subsection B within 90
calendar days after he ceases to be a Qualified Employee. The
election must be made within that time period even if the
Participant does not suffer a Disqualifying Event (e.g., because he
continues in the employ of the Employer or enters the armed
services of the United States). However, if the Participant or former
Participant elects to vest and eventually does not have at least 12
§ 58-33 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-34
1:116
§ 58-35. Death benefits.
Years of Vesting Service when he finally suffers a Disqualifying
Event, the election and waiver shall be revoked, and the former
Participant shall be entitled to a return of contributions under
Subsection B.
B. Return of contributions.
(1) In general. A Participant or former Participant who ceases to be a
Qualified Employee at a time when he is not eligible to receive a
normal retirement benefit will be entitled to a return of all
employee contributions he has made to the plan, if any, plus
interest. The payment will be made as soon as practicable after the
Participant or former Participant files an election to receive a
return of contributions. However, if he has 12 or more Years of
Vesting Service at that time, or does not then suffer a Disqualifying
Event (e.g., because he continues in the employment of the
Employer in a position other than as a Qualified Employee or
because he enters the armed services of the United States) and
believes that he might accrue 12 or more Years of Vesting Service
before he suffers a Disqualifying Event, he may elect to vest his
benefits under the provisions of Subsection A and waive the return
of employee contributions and interest thereon. Any such waiver
shall be irrevocable, unless the former Participant had less than 12
Years of Vesting Service at the time of the election and has less
than 12 Years of Vesting Service when he suffers a Disqualifying
Event.
(2) Interest. For purposes of Subsection B(1), the term "interest" shall
mean interest from the date of contribution to the date of
distribution at the interest rate set forth in the definition of
"equivalent actuarial value" in § 58-29.
A. Retiree receiving benefits. If a former Participant dies after he has
begun receiving payments from this Plan under the normal retirement
benefit, the vested benefit or the disability benefit (provided that the
former Participant was still Disabled at the time of his death), monthly
death benefits in an amount equal to 50% of the monthly payments
being received by the former Participant during his lifetime shall be
paid to his surviving spouse (including surviving spouses whose spouse
died on or before April 17, 2002, and were not married as of such date),
if any, commencing on the first day of the month following the death of
the former Participant and ending on the first day of the month in which
the surviving spouse dies. Effective as of April 17, 2002, if there is no
surviving spouse or the spouse subsequently dies, the child or children
of the deceased Participant shall share equally in a pension equal to
50% of the pension the Participant was receiving or was eligible to
receive at the time of his death until each such child reaches the age of
18 years, or if Attending College, until each such child is under or
attaining the age of 23.
§ 58-34 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-35
1:117
B. Employee eligible to retire. If a Participant or former Participant dies
while he is still employed by the Employer, and the Participant or
former Participant could have received an immediate normal
retirement benefit if he had retired on the date of his death and
survived for at least one month, monthly death benefits in an amount
equal to 25% of the Participant's or former Participant's Final Average
Monthly Compensation shall be paid to his surviving spouse, if any,
commencing on the first day of the month following the death of the
former Participant and ending on the first day of the month in which the
surviving spouse dies.
C. Killed-in-service benefit. Effective for members of the Township's police
force who are killed in service on or after April 17, 2002, and before
January 1, 2010, the surviving spouses of such members shall receive a
pension calculated at 100% of the Participant's Salary at the time of
death. If there is no surviving spouse or the spouse subsequently dies,
the child or children of the member of the police force shall share
equally in a pension calculated at 100% of the Participant's Salary at
the time of death until each such child reaches the age of 18 years, or if
Attending College, until each such child is under or attaining the age of
23 years. Effective with respect to deaths occurring on or after January
1, 2010, the killed-in-service benefit provided for pursuant to this
§ 58-35C shall no longer be payable under the Plan. Unless otherwise
provided for by law or contract, the benefit provided for under this
§ 58-35C shall be payable in the manner provided for under § 58-35A.
D. Return of employee contributions.
(1) In general. If no death benefits are payable under Subsections A
through C with respect to a Participant or former Participant as a
result of his death, and the Participant or former Participant did not
receive any payments from this Plan under a normal retirement
benefit, disability benefit or vested benefit during his lifetime,
effective April 17, 2002, the Plan shall return all employee
contributions made to the Plan by the Participant or former
Participant, if any, plus interest, to the surviving spouse of the
member of the police force, or if there is no surviving spouse or the
spouse subsequently dies, the child or children under the age of 18
years, or if Attending College, under or attaining the age of 23
years, of the member of the police force, shall be entitled to receive
repayment of all money which the member invested in the Fund
plus interest or other increases in value of the member's
investment in the Fund, unless the member has designated another
beneficiary for this purpose as may be provided for under the Plan.
The payment will be made as soon as practicable after the death of
the Participant or former Participant. If the Participant or former
Participant failed to designate a beneficiary, or if no designated
beneficiary shall have survived the Participant or former
Participant, the employee contributions plus interest shall be paid
to the Participant's surviving spouse; if none, then to the surviving

§ 58-36. Limitation on benefits.
children who are under the age of 18 or, if Attending College,
under or attaining the age of 23; if none, then to the estate of the
Participant or former Participant.
(2) Interest. For purposes of Subsection D(1), the term "interest" shall
mean interest from the date of contribution to the date of
distribution at the interest rate set forth in the definition of
"equivalent actuarial value" in § 58-29.
E. No other death benefits. Except as provided in this § 58-35, no
Participant or former Participant, and no estate, heir or beneficiary of
any Participant or former Participant, shall receive any payment or
benefit under this Plan or from the Trust due to the death of a
Participant or former Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
effective January 1, 2007, if a Participant dies while performing
qualified military service [as defined in Section 414(u) of the Code], the
Participant's beneficiary shall be entitled to additional benefits
(including benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military
service), if any, that would be provided under the Plan had the
Participant resumed employment with the Township's police force and
then terminated employment on account of death.
A. Defined benefit dollar limitation. The "defined benefit dollar limitation"
is $195,000, as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under Section
415(d) of the Code in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe, and
payable in the form of a straight life annuity. A limitation as adjusted
under Section 415(d) will apply to limitation years ending with or within
the calendar year for which the adjustment applies.
B. Defined benefit compensation limitation. The "defined benefit
compensation limitation" is the Participant's or former Participant's
high three-year average compensation. In the case of a Participant who
has had a severance from employment, the defined benefit
compensation limitation applicable to the Participant in any limitation
year beginning after the date of severance from employment shall be
automatically adjusted by multiplying the limitation applicable to the
Participant in the prior limitation year by the annual adjustment factor
under Code Section 415(d).
C. High three-year average compensation. The average compensation for
the three consecutive calendar years of service with the Employer that
produces the highest average. In the case of a Participant who is
rehired by the Employer after a severance from employment, the
Participant's high three-year average compensation shall be calculated
by excluding all years for which the Participant performs no services for
and receives no compensation from the Employer (the break period)
and by treating the years immediately preceding and following the
break period as consecutive. For purposes of this § 58-36, a
Participant's compensation shall mean wages, within the meaning of
§ 58-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-36
1:119
Code Section 3401(a), and all other payments of compensation to an
Employee by the company (in the course of the company's trade or
business) for which the company is required to furnish the Participant
a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052.
Compensation shall be determined without regard to any rules under
Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages
based on the nature or location of the employment or services
performed. Compensation paid or made available during a limitation
year shall include amounts that would otherwise be included as
compensation but for a Participant's election under Code Sections
125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k) or 457(b). effective January 1,
2008, and solely for purposes of this § 58-36, compensation shall also
include compensation paid by the later of 2 1/2 months after a
Participant's severance from employment or the end of the calendar
year that includes the date of the Participant's severance from
employment, if the payment is regular compensation for service during
the Participant's regular working hours, or compensation for services
outside the Participant's regular working hours (such as overtime or
shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments,
and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have
been paid to the Participant while the Participant continued in
employment with the Employer. Any payments not described above
shall not be considered compensation if paid after severance from
employment, even if they are paid by the later of 2 1/2 months after
the date of severance from employment or the end of the calendar
year that includes the date of severance from employment. Back pay,
within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be
treated as compensation for the calendar year to which the back pay
relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation
that would otherwise be included under this definition. A Participant's
compensation for a calendar year of service shall not include
compensation in excess of the limitation under Code Section 401(a)(17)
that is in effect for the calendar year in which such year of service
begins.
D. Maximum permissible benefit. The "maximum permissible benefit" is
the lesser of the defined benefit dollar limitation or the defined benefit
compensation limitation (both adjusted where required, as provided in
Subsection E, and, if applicable, in Subsections F or G, below).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, when
expressed as a monthly pension in the form of a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits) over the life of a Participant or former
Participant, a pension benefit hereunder shall not exceed the lesser of
(1) the defined benefit dollar limitation divided by 12, or (2) 100% of the
participants monthly defined benefit compensation limitation. The
maximum shall apply to any pension payable to the Participant or
former Participant as a joint and survivor annuity without any actuarial
reduction.
§ 58-36 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-36
1:120
E. If the participant has fewer than 10 years of participation in the plan,
the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of
participation in the plan and the denominator of which is 10. In the case
of a participant who has fewer than 10 years of service with the
employer, the defined benefit compensation limitation shall be
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years
(or part thereof) of service with the employer and the denominator of
which is 10.
F. If the benefit of a participant begins prior to age 62, the defined benefit
dollar limitation applicable to the participant at such earlier age is an
annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at
the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit
dollar limitation applicable to the participant at age 62 (adjusted under
Subsection E above, if required). The defined benefit dollar limitation
applicable at an age prior to age 62 is computed using a 5% interest
rate and the applicable mortality table as defined in Rev. Rul. 2001-62
or, for distributions prior to January 1, 2008, computed using the
interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in
the definition of "equivalent actuarial value" in § 58-29 of the Plan if
lesser. Any decrease in the defined benefit dollar limitation determined
in accordance with this Subsection F shall not reflect a mortality
decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the
participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality
decrement is taken into account.
G. If the benefit of a participant begins after the participant attains age 65,
the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the participant at the
later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life
annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the
defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the participant at age 65
(adjusted under Subsection D above, if required). The actuarial
equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age
after age 65 is computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the
applicable mortality table as defined in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 or, for
distributions prior to January 1, 2008, computed using the interest rate
and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the definition of
"equivalent actuarial value" in § 58-29 of the Plan if lesser. For these
purposes, mortality between age 65 and the age at which benefits
commence shall be ignored.
H. For all purposes of this Plan, the maximum defined benefit dollar
limitation shall be increased in accordance with § 58-36J of the Plan as
permitted by Section 5(g)(1) of Act 600 [53 P.S. § 771(g)(1)]. As a result
of such an adjustment, a pension which had been limited by the
provisions of this § 58-36 in a previous plan year may be increased with
respect to future payments to the lesser of the adjusted defined benefit
dollar limitation amount or the amount of pension which would have
§ 58-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-36
1:121
§ 58-37. Benefits: miscellaneous provisions.
been payable under this Plan without regard to the provisions of this
§ 58-36.
I. The limitations described in this § 58-36 are intended to comply with
the provisions of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the
Employer shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed
under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations
thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this
§ 58-36 and the provisions of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code
and the regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in
such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of Section 415 of the
Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.
J. Cost of living increases. Cost of living increases, if any, shall be
determined from time to time as provided for in a Cost of Living
Schedule, which shall be attached to the Plan and made a part hereof.
The cost of living increase shall not exceed the percentage increase in
the Consumer Price Index from the year in which the police member
last worked, shall not cause the total police pension benefits to exceed
75% of the Salary used for computing retirement benefits and shall not
cause the total cost of living increase to exceed 30%. No cost of living
increase shall be granted which would impair the actuarial soundness
of the pension fund.
A. Production of information. Before any payment shall be made under this
Plan to or on account of a Participant or former Participant, the
recipient of such payment shall file with or make available to the
Committee such information as the Committee may from time to time
require to determine the recipient's rights and benefits under the Plan.
B. Notice of benefit options. The Committee shall provide a Participant or
former Participant with written notice of the benefit options which are
available to him under the Plan and of the procedures for obtaining
such benefits within a reasonable time after the Participant or former
Participant expresses an interest in retirement, and also approximately
three months before the Participant or former Participant would first
become eligible to receive a normal retirement benefit.
C. Election of benefits and benefit options. All applications for benefit
payments, elections to receive optional forms of benefits, and
beneficiary designations shall be made on forms supplied by the
Committee and within such reasonable periods of time as may be
prescribed by the Committee. The time provided in this Plan for the
commencement of any benefits shall be subject to compliance with the
requirements of Subsection A and this Subsection C.
D. No benefit increases following termination. The amount of benefits to
which a Participant or former Participant may be entitled under this
§ 58-36 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-37
1:122
Plan with respect to any continuous period of employment with the
Employer (whether as a Qualified Employee or not) or any consecutive
periods of employment in which a Disqualifying Event has not occurred
between the beginning of the first of such periods and the day before
the end of the last of such periods, shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Plan in effect on the last day in which the
Participant or former Participant worked for the Employer during such
period or during the last of such consecutive periods. Such amount
shall not be affected by benefit increases which become effective
thereafter.
E. Latest commencement of benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Plan, distribution of benefits under this Plan with
respect to any Participant or former Participant shall commence no
later than the later of:
(1) April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which
the Participant or former Participant attains age 70 1/2; or
(2) April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which
the Participant or former Participant ceases to be employed by the
Employer.
F. Compliance with Code Section 401(a)(9). Not withstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Plan, all distributions of Plan benefits
must comply with the provisions of Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (or any successor provision of any future federal
internal revenue law) and the regulations thereunder, and the
incidental death benefit rules of the Internal Revenue Service.
G. Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act. Not withstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, any benefit hereunder is subject to
reduction in accordance with the provisions of the Public Employee
Pension Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S. § 1311 et seq.
H. Direct rollover.
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that
would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by
the Administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution that is equal to at least $500 paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
(2) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee,
except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:
any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
§ 58-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-37
1:123
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period
of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); the
portion of any other distribution that is not includible in gross
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities);
any hardship distribution described in Code Section
401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) made after December 31, 1999; and any
other distribution that is reasonably expected to total less than
$200 during a year. Effective January 1, 2002, a portion of a
distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution
merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee
contributions which are not includible in gross income;
provided, however, such portion may be transferred only to
(i) an individual retirement account or annuity described in
Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code; (ii) for taxable years
beginning before January 1, 2007, a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of
the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution that is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution that is not so includible; or (iii) for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, a qualified
trust or to an annuity contract described in Section 403(b)
of the Code if such trust or contract provides for separate
accounting for amounts so transferred (including interest
thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution which is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
(b) An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement
account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual
retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an
annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), or a qualified
trust described in Code Section 401(a), that accepts the
distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case
of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an
"eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account
or individual retirement annuity. Effective for distributions
made after December 31, 2001, an "eligible retirement plan"
shall also mean an annuity contract described in Code Section
403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is
maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any
agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a
state and which agrees to separately account for amounts
transferred into such plan from this Plan. Effective for
distributions made after December 31, 2001, an "eligible
retirement plan" shall also apply in the case of a distribution to
a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the
§ 58-37 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-37
1:124
§ 58-38. Employer contributions.
§ 58-39. Employee contributions.
alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as
defined in Code Section 414(p). Effective January 1, 2008, an
eligible retirement plan shall also mean a Roth IRA described
in Code Section 408A.
(c) A "distributee" includes an Employee or former Employee. In
addition, the Employee's or former Employee's surviving
spouse and the Employee's or former Employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p),
are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
former spouse. Effective for distributions made on or after
January 1, 2010, "distributee" shall also mean the Employee's
nonspouse designated beneficiary; provided, however, that the
direct rollover for a nonspouse designated beneficiary may be
made only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Code Sections 408(a) or 408(b) that is established
on behalf of the Employee's nonspouse designated beneficiary
and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the
provisions of Code Section 402(c)(11).
(d) A "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
A. The Employer shall, from time to time, contribute to the Plan and Trust
the amounts required to fund all the benefits provided under this Plan
to the extent they are not funded by employee contributions under
§ 58-39. The minimum amount of Employer contributions shall be
determined in accordance with the calculations of the Pension
Consultant and as required by the Municipal Pension Plan Funding
Standard and Recovery Act, 53 P. S. § 895.101 et seq. Employer
contributions may be derived from grants of state aid, disbursements
from the Township's general fund, and other sources.
B. All Employer contributions shall be paid to the Trustee to be held in the
Trust. The Trust shall be used to pay all benefits under this Plan.
A. Each month, each Qualified Employee (including Qualified Employees
on paid leaves of absence) shall contribute an amount equal to 5% of his
Salary for the month to the Trust.
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A, the Commissioners
may, by ordinance or resolution, on an annual basis, so reduce or
eliminate the contributions required under Subsection A for the
following Plan Year. No ordinance or resolution under this Subsection B
may affect any year beyond the first Plan Year which begins after the
date the ordinance or resolution is passed. Except as otherwise
§ 58-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-39
1:125
§ 58-40. Administration and management of plan and trust.
provided in this Subsection B, reduction or elimination of member
contributions shall not permit the return of contributions or any
interest or fund earnings to be made to Participants while actively
employed as a police officer by the Employer. Where an agreement,
collectively bargained or otherwise, arbitration award or court decision
was agreed to, issued or rendered on or prior to February 23, 1994,
which provided for a return of contributions, with or without interest,
or fund earnings to members, a return of contributions, with or without
interest, or fund earnings shall be made to members and any such
return of contributions shall reduce or eliminate any entitlement to
refunds pursuant to § 58-34. The Employer making such return or
Participant receiving such return shall be required to restore to the
Plan any such contributions, interest or fund earnings. Effective
January 1, 2004, and until such time as the Commissioners determine
otherwise by appropriate resolution, a Qualified Employee is not
required to contribute an amount equal to 5% of his Salary each month
to the Plan.
C. If a Qualified Employee refuses, at any time, to contribute any amounts
required under this § 58-39, he shall forfeit all benefits under this Plan
which are based on service prior to the date of the refusal, except a
return of his previously contributed employee contributions.
D. No Participant shall be required to make any contributions to this Plan
during any period of service in the uniformed services of the United
States. If such a Participant returns to employment with the Employer,
he/she shall contribute to the Plan an amount equal to the rate in effect
under Subsections A and B for the period of uniformed service
multiplied by the deemed Compensation of the Participant for such
period. (Where more than one rate is in effect during the period of
uniformed service, a calculation shall be performed for each portion of
the period of uniformed service governed by a separate rate, and the
total required contribution shall be equal to the sum of such
calculations.) The contribution shall be made during the period
beginning with the date of reemployment and whose duration is the
lesser of (1) three times the period of the person's service in the
uniformed services, or (2) five years.
E. A Participant on an unpaid leave of absence shall make a contribution to
this Plan for the portion of the leave for which he/she accrues service
credit under § 58-30 in an amount equal to the rate in effect under
Subsections A and B for the period of leave in which service is credited
multiplied by the deemed Compensation of the Participant for such
period. (Where more than one rate is in effect during such period, a
calculation shall be performed for each portion of the period governed
by a separate rate, and the total required contribution shall be equal to
the sum of such calculations.) The contribution shall be made no later
than six months after the expiration of the leave.
§ 58-39 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-40

A. Administrative Committee.
(1) The South Whitehall Township Pension Committee shall administer
the South Whitehall Township Office Personnel Pension Plan, the
South Whitehall Township Public Works Union Employees’ Pension
Plan, and the South Whitehall Township Police Pension Plan and
Trust. The Committee shall consist of a minimum of three persons
and a maximum of seven persons. The members of the Committee
shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Commissioners, with
appointments to the Committee being made by resolution of the
Board of Commissioners from time to time. Any member of the
Committee may resign by delivering his written resignation to the
Commissioners and to the Committee. [Amended 10-17-2012 by
Ord. No. 961]
(2) Organization and operation of the Committee. A majority of the
appointed members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for
all actions taken by the Committee. Any such action may be taken
either by vote at a meeting or in writing without a meeting. The
Committee may authorize any one or more of its members to
execute any document or documents on behalf of the Committee, in
which event the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of
such action and the name or names of its member or members so
designated. Thereafter, the Trustee shall accept and rely upon any
document executed by such member or members as representing
action by the Committee until the Committee shall file with the
Trustee a written revocation of such designation. The Committee
may adopt such by-laws and regulations as it deems desirable for
the conduct of its affairs, and may appoint such accountants,
consultants and other persons as it may deem necessary or
desirable in connection with the administration of this Plan. The
Committee shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon, and shall be
fully protected in any action taken by it in good faith in relying
upon, any opinions or reports which shall be furnished to it by any
such accountant, counsel or other consultants.
(3) Powers and duties. The Committee shall administer the Plan in
accordance with its terms, shall direct the Trustee to make the
benefit payments provided under this Plan, and shall have all
powers necessary to carry out the provisions of the Plan. The
Committee shall establish, from time to time, and periodically
review all actuarial assumptions used in administering the Plan, in
consultation with the Pension Consultant appointed under
Subsection C. The Committee shall interpret the Plan and shall
determine all questions arising in the administration,
interpretation and application of the Plan. Any such determination
by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
(4) Records and reports. The Committee shall keep a record of all its
proceedings and acts, and shall keep all such books of account,
records and other data as may be necessary for the proper
§ 58-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-40
1:127
administration of the Plan. The Committee shall notify the Trustee
and the Employer of any action taken by the Committee and, when
required, shall notify any other interested person or persons.
(5) Payment of expenses. Unless otherwise determined by the
Commissioners, the members of the Committee shall serve without
compensation for services as such, but all expenses of the
Committee shall be paid by the Trust or the Employer in such
manner as the Employer shall determine. Such expenses shall
include any expenses incident to the functioning of the Committee,
including but not limited to fees of accountants, counsel,
consultants and other specialists, and any other costs of
administering the Plan.
(6) Immunity from liability; indemnification. No member of the
Committee shall incur any liability for any action or failure to act
except with respect to his own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Employer shall and does hereby indemnify each
member of the Committee against any and all claims, losses,
damages, expenses and liabilities arising from any action or failure
to act, except when the same is judicially determined to be due to
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such member. In
addition, the Committee and any member or agent thereof shall be
fully protected in relying upon the advice of any counsel, consultant
or actuary appointed by the Committee or the Employer.
B. The Trust.
(1) In general. All of the funds of this Plan shall be held by a corporate
trustee or trustees appointed by the Commissioners, in trust, in
accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement which follows
§ 58-43,6 as it may be amended from time to time. Said Trust
Agreement is incorporated herein by reference. The Trust created
or existing under the Trust Agreement shall be a part of this Plan
for use in providing the benefits of this Plan and paying any
expenses not directly paid by the Employer. Neither the Employer,
the Committee nor the Commissioners shall have any responsibility
for the administration of the Trust funds or any liability for any loss
with respect thereto.
(2) Rights in trust funds. No part of the corpus or income of the Trust
shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive
benefit of Participants, former Participants, and beneficiaries of
this Plan prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under this Plan
with respect to such persons. No person shall have any interest in
or right to any part of the earnings or assets of the Trust except as
and to the extent expressly provided in this Plan and in the Trust
Agreement.
6. Editor's Note: The Trust Agreement is on file in the Township offices.
§ 58-40 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-40
1:128
§ 58-41. Amendment.
(3) Source of plan benefits. The Trust is designed to be and shall be the
sole source of the benefits provided under the Plan. The Employer
does not guarantee such benefits or payments or assume any
obligation with respect thereto other than to pay into the Trust the
contributions provided under § 58-38.
(4) Trustee. The Commissioners hereby reaffirm the appointment of
Wells Fargo Bank as Trustee of the Trust.
(5) No funding by individual policies. The Plan shall not be funded on
an individual insurance policy basis.
C. Pension Consultant. The Commissioners hereby appoint Conrad Siegel
Actuaries as the Pension Consultant to the Plan and Trust to serve at
the pleasure of the Commissioners.
D. Nondiscrimination. Whenever there is a choice or decision to be made
by the Employer or the Committee in connection with the
administration of the Plan, the result shall be uniformly applied then
and thereafter in all similar circumstances so that there shall be no
discrimination in the operation of the Plan.
A. The Commissioners may by ordinance at any time and from time to time
modify or amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the
Plan and/or Trust Agreement, including the method of financing the
Plan, provided that:
(1) No modification or amendment may be made which would have the
effect of depriving any retired former Participant or beneficiary
receiving a retirement benefit of any benefits under the Plan to
which he would otherwise be entitled by reason of the accumulated
funds held under the Plan at that time, unless such former
Participant or contingent annuitant consents thereto;
(2) No modification or amendment may be made which would reduce
the benefits of any Participant or former Participant to the extent
they have been earned as of the date of the modification or
amendment;
(3) No modification or amendment may be made which would increase
the number of Years of Vesting Service specified in § 58-34A to
qualify for the vested benefit, or would otherwise change the
vesting schedule of the Plan (currently 0% for 11 or fewer Years of
Vesting Service and 100% for 12 or more Years of Vesting Service)
to the potential detriment of any Participant;
(4) No such modification or amendment shall make it possible for any
part of the funds of the Plan to be used for or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants, former
§ 58-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-41
1:129
§ 58-42. Termination and merger.
Participants, and contingent annuitants under the Plan prior to the
satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to them; and
(5) No such modification or amendment shall make it possible for the
Employer to appoint to the position of Trustee anyone other than a
corporate trustee.
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any modifications or amendments of
the Plan may be made by ordinance, retroactively if necessary, which
the Commissioners may deem necessary or appropriate to make the
Plan conform to the requirements of any law or governmental
regulation now or hereafter enacted or promulgated, or to qualify the
Plan and Trust as exempt under existing or future federal, state, or local
income tax or estate tax laws and regulations.
A. Right of termination. Although the Employer expects and desires that
this Plan shall be permanent, it reserves the right to terminate the Plan
for any reason at any time and discontinue contributions to this Plan, to
the extent permitted by state and federal law.
B. Use of funds upon termination. In case of termination of this Plan, all
active Participants who are accruing benefits shall become fully vested
in their accrued benefits and the funds of the Plan and Trust shall be
used for the exclusive benefit of Participants, former Participants, and
beneficiaries to the extent of their rights under the Plan. However, if the
Employer, because of erroneous actuarial calculations, shall have
contributed funds in excess of the amount required to satisfy all
liabilities of the Plan for benefits, then such excess shall be returned to
the Employer.
C. Order of payments. In the event this Plan is terminated or the Employer
discontinues making contributions to this Plan, the Committee shall
determine the share of the funds of the Plan and Trust allocable to each
Participant, former Participant and contingent annuitant in the
following order, except as may be required by rule, regulation or
direction of the Internal Revenue Service, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation or the Pennsylvania Auditor General's office:
(1) Any benefits that Participants, former Participants or beneficiaries
have accrued to the date of termination or discontinuance of
contributions, to the extent that these benefits are then funded or
credited to their individual accounts, shall be nonforfeitable and
payable to them. If the funds of the Plan are insufficient to provide
for all such benefits in full, each benefit shall be reduced pro rata.
(2) To the extent that the accrued benefits are not funded or credited
on an individual basis, they shall be payable in the following order:
(a) Each retired former Participant or his beneficiary receiving a
retirement benefit and each Participant or former Participant
§ 58-41 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-42
1:130
§ 58-43. Miscellaneous provisions.
who has not yet retired from employment with the Employer
but who is entitled to retire and receive a normal retirement
benefit shall be entitled to a benefit equal to the reserve
computed to be required to provide his full accrued benefits. If
the funds of the Plan and Trust are insufficient to provide in full
for all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(a), then all benefits
under this Subsection C(2)(a) shall be reduced pro rata.
(b) After the benefits under the provisions of Subsection C(2)(a)
above have been set aside in full, each other person entitled to
a benefit hereunder shall be entitled to a benefit equal to the
reserve computed to be required to provide his accrued
benefits. If the funds of the Plan and Trust are insufficient to
provide in full for all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(b),
then all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(b) shall be reduced
pro rata.
D. Form of termination payments. To the extent permitted by law, the
Committee may require that all shares of the Trust be paid following the
termination of the Plan (or the complete discontinuance of Employer
contributions to the Plan) in cash, in immediate annuities, in deferred
annuities, or in other periodic payment forms, or in one of such forms
permitted by the Committee and elected by the recipient.
E. Merger.
(1) For purposes of this Subsection E, the term "merger" shall mean
any merger or consolidation of this Plan and/or the Trust with any
other plan, or any transfer of the assets or liabilities of this Plan
and/or the Trust to any other plan.
(2) The terms of any merger must specify that if this Plan or its
successor were to terminate immediately after the merger, each
Participant and former Participant shall receive a benefit which is
not less than he would have received in the event this Plan
terminated immediately before such merger.
A. No other legal rights conferred by plan. The establishment and
maintenance of this Plan shall not be construed as conferring any legal
rights upon employees or other persons to a continuation of
employment with the Employer nor shall it interfere with the rights of
the Employer to discharge any person or to treat him without regard to
the effect which such treatment might have upon him as a Participant
or former Participant in the Plan.
B. Spendthrift provisions. No benefit under this Plan shall be subject in
any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,
pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to do so shall be void,
except as specifically provided in this Plan, nor shall any such benefit be
§ 58-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-43
1:131
in any manner liable for or subject to garnishment, attachment,
execution, levy or other legal process for the collection of debts, or
liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or
torts of the person entitled to such benefit. In the event the Committee
shall find that any Participant, former Participant, or contingent
annuitant under this Plan has become incompetent, bankrupt or
insolvent, or that any attempt has been made to anticipate, alienate,
sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any of his benefits
under the Plan, except as specifically provided in the Plan, then such
benefit shall cease and terminate and in such event the Committee and
the Trustee shall hold or apply the same to or for the benefit of such
Participant, former Participant or contingent annuitant, his spouse,
children or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner as the
Committee may find proper from time to time.
C. Right to inspect documents. Notwithstanding any information that is
made available by the Employer, Committee or Trustee to any person
through the distribution of descriptive booklets, bulletin board notices,
payroll notices or oral announcements, any Participant or former
Participant may examine the Plan as presented in this article and
amendments thereto, and the Trust Agreement and all amendments
thereto, at the main office of the Employer at such mutually convenient
time as is arranged by the Participant or former Participant and a
representative of the Employer, Committee or Trustee.
D. Compliance with Act 600. This Plan is designed to comply with the
provisions of Pennsylvania Act 600 of 1955 (enacted May 29, 1956), as
amended, 53 P.S. § 767 et seq. To the extent there is any discrepancy
between the provisions of this Plan and any of the requirements of Act
600, this Plan shall be interpreted and construed as if it had been
written in conformity with the requirements of Act 600.
E. Severability. In the event that any provision, section, sentence, clause
or part of this Plan shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable, such
invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect or impair any remaining
provision, section, sentence, clause or part of this Plan, it being the
intent of the Commissioners of the Township that such remainder be
and remain in full force and effect.
F. Construction. When used herein, the masculine shall include the
feminine and neuter, as appropriate. Section, subsection, paragraph
and subparagraph headings are included for purposes of convenience
only and are not to be considered a part of this Plan or used to interpret

ARTICLE V
Public Works Union Employees Pension Plan
[Adopted 12-17-2003 by Ord. No. 788; amended in its entirety
5-19-2010 by Ord. No. 914]
§ 58-44. Continuation of plan.
The Commissioners of the Township of South Whitehall established the
South Whitehall Township Employees' Pension Plan ("Employees' Plan")
and the South Whitehall Township Employees' Pension Trust ("Employees'
Trust"), effective December 31, 1967, by Ordinance No. 75, enacted
December 20, 1967. The Employees' Plan and the Employees' Trust have
been amended from time to time thereafter. Effective as of January 1,
1989, the Commissioners split the Employees' Plan and the Employees'
Trust into two separate plans and trusts, one for the nonunion employees
of the Township and the other for the nonuniformed union employees of
the Township. In order to do so, the Employees' Plan and the Employees'
Trust were renamed the South Whitehall Township Public Works Union
Employees' Pension Plan and the South Whitehall Township Public Works
Union Employees' Pension Trust and thereafter covered public works union
employees of the Township who were previously covered under the
Employees' Plan and the Employees' Trust. The other employees who were
previously covered under the Employees' Plan and the Employees' Trust
were covered thereafter under the plan and trust established under
Sections 1.161 through 1.173 of the Codified Ordinances. Effective as of
January 1, 2010, the Commissioners hereby continue said plan as the "South
Whitehall Township Public Works Union Employees' Pension Plan" and
amend and restate it in its entirety. The pension benefits of any participant
who terminated his employment with the Township prior to January 1, 2010,
shall be determined solely under the provisions of the plan in effect at the
time of his termination.
§ 58-45. Definitions.
When used in §§ 58-44 through 58-56 with initial capital letters, the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless a different
meaning is plainly required by the context:
ANNIVERSARY DATE — Each December 31.
COMMISSIONERS — The Board of Commissioners of the Township of South
Whitehall.
COMMITTEE — The committee appointed by the Commissioners under
§ 58-53A to administer the Plan.
COMPENSATION — The Compensation of an employee for a given year
(or other period for which a determination is being made), the amount of
Compensation actually paid, made available or includible in gross income
for the year (or other determination period). [In the case of a period during
which an employee is serving in the uniformed forces of the United States,
or during the term of any other approved leave of absence, the employee's
§ 58-44 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-45
1:133
Compensation shall be computed (A) at the rate the employee would have
received but for the uniformed service or other leave of absence, or (B)
in the case that the determination of such rate is not reasonably certain,
on the basis of the employee's average rate of compensation during the
twelve-month period immediately preceding the period of uniformed service
or leave of absence (or, if shorter, the period of employment immediately
preceding such period)]. However, "Compensation" shall not include any
compensation in excess of the amount in effect for such year under Section
401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
If Compensation is ever required to be determined for a period of time
which contains fewer than 12 months, the amount in effect for such period
under Code Section 401(a)(17) shall be equal to the amount in effect under
Code Section 401(a)(17) for the calendar year in which the period begins,
multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is equal to the number of months
in the period and whose denominator is 12.
DISABLED — A person shall be considered "Disabled" if he has a physical
or mental condition which renders him qualified to receive permanent
and total disability benefits under the Federal Social Security Act (or any
successor Act) and if he is actually receiving such benefits.
DISQUALIFYING EVENT — With respect to any given person, each of the
following shall be a "Disqualifying Event":
EMPLOYER — The Township of South Whitehall, a Pennsylvania First Class
Township and municipal corporation, located in Lehigh County,
Pennsylvania.
The voluntary or involuntary termination of the person's employment
with the Employer, unless the termination occurs due to the
conscription, enlistment or appointment of the person to service in the
Armed Forces of the United States, or because of a condition which
renders the person Disabled. However, if the Employer shall terminate
the person's employment due to insufficient work for such person or
shall indicate that the termination is temporary, such termination shall
be considered a "layoff" and not a "termination" unless the layoff
continues for a period in excess of six months. The mere cessation
of a person's status as a Qualified Employee shall not constitute a
"termination" under this subsection; only a termination from all
employment with the Employer shall be a "termination";
A.
The person's failure to return to work at the end of any leave of
absence, after ceasing to be Disabled, or upon recall following a layoff;
B.
The lapse of the person's right under the then-effective laws of the
United States to reinstatement of employment with the Employer
following a period of service with the Armed Forces of the United
States, unless the person was reinstated before such lapse; or the
failure of the person to qualify for reinstatement rights following a
period of service with the Armed Forces of the United States.

Participant, the Compensation paid to the Participant or former Participant
during the thirty-six-month period ending on his Qualification Date (whether
for service as a Qualified Employee or otherwise), divided by 36. However,
if a Participant or former Participant shall not have been an employee
of the Employer throughout the thirty-six-month period, his Final Average
Monthly Compensation shall be his Compensation during his last 36 months
of employment through the Qualification Date (regardless of whether he
was employed as a Qualified Employee or otherwise), divided by 36; and
if he shall not have been an employee of the Employer for a total of at
least 36 months before his Qualification Date (whether consecutive or not),
his Final Average Monthly Compensation shall be his Compensation during
all periods of employment with the Employer through the Qualification
Date (regardless of whether he was employed as a Qualified Employee or
otherwise), divided by the number of months of his employment with the
Employer through the Qualification Date (rounded to the nearest 0.001 of a
month).

requirements of § 58-47.

Commissioners under § 58-53C.

(a) In general. Except as provided in Subsection A(1)(b), the
person shall be credited with one day of vesting service for
each calendar day:
[1] That he is actually employed by the Employer (whether as
a Qualified Employee or not), including normal vacations,
holidays, sick leave, weekends and other days off; or
[2] Of service in the uniformed services of the United States,
provided that (I) such service immediately follows service
with the Employer as a Qualified Employee, and (II) the
person returns to employment with the Employer at a time
when the Employer is legally obligated to reemploy the
person under the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38 U.S.C. § 4301 et seq.
and any amendments, supplements or successor
legislation. Credit under this Subsection A(1)(a)[2] shall be
granted upon the person's return to employment with the
Employer.
§ 58-45 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-46
1:136
(b) Exclusions. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection
A(1)(a), a day of vesting service shall not be credited as of the
determination date for any working or nonworking day:
[1] Within any period or employment solely as an elected
official;
[2] Within any period of employment in a position regularly
scheduled for fewer than 1,500 hours of work in a calendar
year;

[7] After the determination date; or
[8] On or before the date of any Disqualifying Event which
occurs with respect to the person before the determination
date.
(2) Months of vesting service. The number of months of vesting service
credited to the person as of the determination date shall be the sum
of:
(a) The number of calendar months in which every day of the
month is a day of vesting service; and
(b) The number of days of vesting service credited to the person as
of the determination date, other than those described under
Subsection A(2)(a), divided by the actual number of days in
such calendar month (rounding down any fraction to the next
whole number and eliminating any fractional amount).
(3) Years of Vesting Service. The number of Years of Vesting Service
credited to the person as of the determination date, which number
may be expressed as a fraction, shall be the number of months of
vesting service credited to the person as of the determination date
divided by 12.
B. Benefit accrual service. A person's benefit accrual service as of any
given date (the "determination date") shall be determined by applying
the provisions of Subsection A with the following modifications:
(1) The words "vesting service" shall be replaced with the words
"benefit accrual service" every time they occur therein; and
§ 58-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-46
1:137
§ 58-47. Participation.
(2) Subparagraph A(1)(b)[2] shall be modified to read as follows:
"within any period that the person is not a Qualified Employee."
A. Continuing participants. All persons who were Qualified Employees on
January 1, 2010, and were members of or participants in the Plan
immediately before that date shall continue as Participants under this
Plan as of January 1, 2010.
B. New participants. A present or future employee of the Employer other
than one described in Subsection A shall become a Participant on the
later of (1) the 91st day following the commencement of his
employment with the Employer (whether as a Qualified Employee or
not), or (2) the day the person first becomes a Qualified Employee.
C. Termination of participation. A Participant shall cease to be a
Participant under this Plan upon the occurrence of a Disqualifying
Event. A Participant shall also cease to be a Participant under this Plan
if he ceases to be a Qualified Employee but continues in the employ of
the Employer. He shall then be a former Participant until all benefits to
which he may be entitled hereunder are paid.
D. Reemployment of a former participant.
(1) If a person who formerly was a Participant shall again become a
Qualified Employee, and no Disqualifying Event shall have
occurred at or after the time he ceased to be a Participant, he shall
again become a Participant immediately upon becoming a Qualified
Employee.
(2) If a person who formerly was a Participant in this Plan or the South
Whitehall Township Employees' Pension Plan shall again become a
Qualified Employee, and a Disqualifying Event shall have occurred
at or after the time he ceased to be a Participant, he shall be
treated as if he were two different employees — one who was
employed at the earlier time and one who was employed at the later
time. Thus, he shall be treated as an entirely new employee of the
Employer for purposes of any benefits under this Plan related to the
new period of employment, and shall become a Participant again
only under the terms of Subsection B; his benefits for the new
period shall be based solely on Compensation and service during
the new period. However, he shall retain the right to receive all
unpaid vested pension benefits to which he is entitled with respect
to his previous period of employment in accordance with the
pension provisions of the Plan in effect on the last day of the
previous period of employment, without regard to any Plan
amendments enacted thereafter (see § 58-51E) or any
Compensation from or service to the Employer thereafter. Any
benefits payable with respect to the previous period of employment
§ 58-46 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-47
1:138
§ 58-48. Benefits: in general.
shall be in addition to any benefits payable with respect to the new
period of employment.
A. Normal retirement benefit. A Participant or former Participant shall be
entitled to receive a normal retirement benefit if he retires from all
employment with the Employer after having attained the age of 65
years and at a time when he has at least seven Years of Vesting Service.
The normal retirement benefit shall be paid in the following form,
unless the Participant or former Participant elects an optional form
under § 58-49: a series of equal monthly payments beginning on the
first day of the month following retirement and ending on the first day
of the month following the month during which the recipient's death
occurs in an amount equal to 1.5% of his Final Average Monthly
Compensation multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as of
the date of retirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant
who retires from all employment with the Employer on or after January
1, 2006, and has attained the age of 65 years and has completed at least
seven Years of Vesting Service shall be eligible to receive a normal
retirement benefit in an amount equal to 2% of his Final Average
Monthly Compensation multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual
Service as of the date of retirement.
B. Deferred retirement benefit. If a Participant or former Participant
retires from all employment with the Employer more than one month
after the first date he could have retired under Subsection A (relating to
normal retirement), he shall receive the deferred retirement benefit
rather than the normal retirement benefit if the former is of greater
Equivalent Actuarial Value. The deferred retirement benefit shall be
paid in the following form, unless the Participant or former Participant
elects an optional form under § 58-49: a series of equal monthly
payments beginning on the first day of the month following retirement
and ending on the first day of the month following the month during
which the recipient's death occurs in an amount such that the deferred
retirement benefit is of Equivalent Actuarial Value to the normal
retirement benefit which would have been payable to the recipient if he
had retired on the first date he could have retired under Subsection A
(relating to normal retirement) and not earned any Compensation from
the Employer thereafter.
C. Early retirement benefit. A Participant or former Participant may elect
to receive an early retirement benefit if he retires from all employment
with the Employer when such Participant's or former Participant's
attained age and Years of Vesting Service, when added together, equal
or exceed 80 or more. The early retirement benefit shall be paid in the
following form, unless the Participant or former Participant elects an
optional form under § 58-49: a series of equal monthly payments
beginning on the first day of the month following retirement and ending
on the first day of the month following the month during which the
§ 58-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-48
1:139
recipient's death occurs in an amount equal to 1.5% of his Final
Average Monthly Compensation, multiplied by his Years of Benefit
Accrual Service as of the date of retirement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Participant who retires from all employment with the
Employer on or after January 1, 2006, when such Participant's attained
age and Years of Vesting Service, when added together, equal or exceed
80 or more, shall be eligible to receive an early retirement benefit in
an amount equal to 2% of his Final Average Monthly Compensation
multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as of the date of
retirement.
D. Disability retirement benefit.
(1) A Participant or former Participant who becomes Disabled may
elect to receive a disability retirement benefit if the condition
which renders him Disabled commences while he is in the employ
of the Employer (whether as a Qualified Employee or otherwise).
The disability retirement benefit shall be paid in a series of equal
monthly payments beginning on the first day of the month following
the month in which the recipient demonstrates to the satisfaction of
the Committee that he is Disabled and ending on the earlier of (i)
the first day of the month following the month during which the
recipient's death occurs or (ii) the first day of the month following
the month during which the recipient ceases to be Disabled. The
amount of each monthly payment shall be such that if the disability
retirement benefit were paid until the death of the recipient, the
disability retirement benefit would be of Equivalent Actuarial Value
to a series of equal monthly payments beginning on the first day of
the month following the later of the month the recipient would
attain age 65 or the month the recipient would first have seven
Years of Vesting Service had he continued in the employ of the
Employer until such time, and continuing until the first day of the
month following the month during which the recipient's death
occurs, in an amount equal to 1.5% of the recipient's Final Average
Monthly Compensation, multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual
Service as of the Qualification Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Participant who becomes disabled on or after January
1, 2006, shall be eligible to receive a disability retirement benefit in
an amount equal to 2% of his Final Average Monthly Compensation
multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as of the
Qualification Date.
(2) A person shall be ineligible to receive any other benefit under this
Plan during any period in which he is Disabled if he elects to
receive the disability retirement benefit.
(3) If a person who received a disability retirement benefit ceases to be
Disabled and does not immediately thereafter return to the employ
of the Employer, the amount of any benefit the person may be
entitled to receive under this Plan with respect to the period before
§ 58-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-48
1:140
he ceased to be Disabled shall be reduced by the Equivalent
Actuarial Value of the disability retirement benefit paid to him.
(4) If a person who received a disability retirement benefit ceases to be
Disabled and immediately thereafter returns to the employ of the
Employer, the amount of any benefit the person may be entitled to
receive under this Plan shall be reduced by the Equivalent
Actuarial Value of the disability retirement benefit paid to him.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if such a person's total
benefits under this Plan would have been greater if he were treated
as having failed to immediately return to the employ of the
Employer after he ceased to be Disabled (so as to suffer a
Disqualifying Event) and as then becoming a new employee of the
Employer upon his return, he shall be so treated.
E. Vested benefit.
(1) In general. A Participant or former Participant who suffers a
Disqualifying Event at a time when he is not eligible to receive a
normal retirement benefit, deferred retirement benefit, or early
retirement benefit will be entitled to a vested benefit under this
Plan if he has seven or more Years of Vesting Service as of the date
of the Disqualifying Event. If he has less than seven Years of Vesting
Service as of such date, he shall not be entitled to any benefits
under this Plan for the period covered by those Years of Vesting
Service, except as provided in Subsection G of this § 58-48.
(2) Normal vested benefit. Unless the former Participant makes an
election under Subsection E(3) to receive an early vested benefit, a
former Participant entitled to receive a vested benefit shall receive
his benefit as a normal vested benefit. A normal vested benefit shall
be paid in the following form: equal monthly payments
commencing on the first date a normal retirement benefit (see
Subsection A) could have commenced if the former Participant had
continued in the employ of the Employer until he was entitled to
receive a normal retirement benefit, and continuing until the first
day of the month following the month during which his death
occurs, in an amount equal to 1.5% of his Final Average Monthly
Compensation, multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as
of the date of his Disqualifying Event for a Disqualifying Event that
occurred prior to January 1, 2006, or an amount equal to 2% of his
Final Average Monthly Compensation multiplied by his Years of
Benefit Accrual Service as of the date of his Disqualifying Event for
a Disqualifying Event that occurs on or after January 1, 2006.
(3) Early vested benefit. A former Participant entitled to receive a
vested benefit may elect to receive an early vested benefit rather
than a normal vested benefit under Subsection E(2) at any time
after he attains age 55, provided that he had at least 25 Years of
Vesting Service at the time of his Disqualifying Event. An early
vested benefit shall be paid in the following form: a series of equal
§ 58-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-48
1:141
monthly payments beginning on the first day of the second month
following the election and continuing until the first day of the
month following the month during which the recipient's death
occurs, in an amount such that the early vested benefit is of
Equivalent Actuarial Value to the normal vested benefit the
recipient would otherwise have received under Subsection E(2).
(4) Cash-out of vested benefit. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Subsection E(2) and (3), if the Equivalent Actuarial Value of a
former Participant's normal vested benefit is $5,000 or less, the
Committee may pay such Equivalent Actuarial Value to the former
Participant in a lump sum at any time after his Disqualifying Event
in lieu of any normal vested benefit or early vested benefit.
Effective for distributions after March 28, 2005, the Participant
must consent to any distribution under this § 58-48E(4) if the
Equivalent Actuarial Value of the former Participant's Normal
Vested Benefit is greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to
$5,000.
F. Death benefits.
(1) Person eligible for early retirement. If a Participant or former
Participant dies while in the employ of the Employer (whether as a
Qualified Employee or otherwise) at a time when he could have
elected to receive an early retirement benefit (see Subsection C)
but would not have been entitled to a normal retirement benefit
(see Subsection A), benefits shall be paid to his surviving spouse (if
any) as if the Participant or former Participant had retired on the
day before his death, elected on the day before his death to receive
an early retirement benefit in the form of a joint and survivor
annuity (see § 58-49A), and designated his spouse as the contingent
annuitant.
(2) Person eligible for normal retirement. If a Participant or former
Participant dies while in the employ of the Employer (whether as a
Qualified Employee or otherwise) at a time when he could have
retired and received a normal retirement benefit (see Subsection A)
or deferred retirement benefit (see Subsection B), benefits shall be
paid to his designated contingent annuitant (or, if none has been
designated or survives him, his surviving spouse, if any) as if he had
retired on the day before his death and elected to receive his
benefits in the form of a joint and survivor annuity (see § 58-49A).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant or former
Participant had filed an election before his death to receive future
Plan benefits in the ten-year certain form (see § 58-49B), and if any
of his contingent annuitants shall survive him, benefits shall
instead be paid to his contingent annuitants as if he had retired on
the day before his death and elected to receive his benefits in the
ten-year certain form.
§ 58-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-48
1:142
(3) Vested employee not eligible for early or normal retirement. If,
after October 1, 1995, a Participant or former Participant dies at a
time when he has credit for at least seven Years of Vesting Service,
but would not have been entitled to elect to receive an early
retirement benefit (see Subsection C) or a normal retirement
benefit (see Subsection A), benefits shall be paid to his surviving
spouse (if any) as follows: a series of equal monthly payments
beginning on the first day of the month following the date the
(former) Participant would have attained the age 55 [or, if the
(former) Participant had already attained age 55 by the time of his
death, beginning on the first day of the month following the date of
the (former) Participant's death], and continuing until the first day
of the month following the month during which the surviving
spouse's death occurs, in an amount equal to the monthly payments
that the surviving spouse would receive as the survivor annuitant
under the following hypothetical annuity:
(a) A joint and survivor annuity in a series of equal monthly
payments commencing on the date the spousal benefits are to
commence under this Subsection F(3), payable to the (former)
Participant throughout his life and payable after his death to
his surviving spouse's death, which is of Equivalent Actuarial
Value to an annuity for the life of the (former) Participant in a
series of equal monthly payments beginning on the first day of
the month following the month in which the (former)
Participant would have attained age 65 and continuing until
the first day of the month following the month during which his
death occurs, in a monthly amount equal to 1.5% of the
(former) Participant's Final Average Monthly Compensation
with respect to determinations made prior to January 1, 2006,
multiplied by his Years of Benefit Accrual Service as of the date
he actually died, or 2% of the (former) Participant's Final
Average Monthly Compensation with respect to determinations
made on or after January 1, 2006, multiplied by his Years of
Benefit Accrual Service as of the date he actually died. [In
calculating the value and amount of the payments to be made
under a life annuity or joint and survivor annuity, it is
necessary to make assumptions about the life expectancies of
the annuitants. Therefore, for purposes of these hypothetical
annuities, the life expectancy of the (former) Participant at the
commencement of these annuities shall be determined in
accordance with the Plan's actuarial mortality assumptions,
without considering the fact that the (former) Participant has
already died. However, once the amount of benefit payments
are calculated under these annuities, it shall be recognized
that the (former) Participant actually died before payments
began, so that all benefits will be paid to his surviving spouse
as the survival annuitant.]
(4) Return of employee contributions.
§ 58-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-48
1:143
(a) In general. If no death benefits are payable under Subsection
F(1) through (3) with respect to a Participant or former
Participant as a result of his death (including the situation
where no death benefits are payable thereunder because there
is no surviving spouse or children), and the Participant or
former Participant did not receive any payments from this Plan
under a normal retirement benefit, deferred retirement
benefit, early retirement benefit, disability retirement benefit,
normal vested benefit, early vested benefit, or a return of
employee contributions under Subsection G, the Plan shall pay
a benefit to the beneficiary designated by the Participant or
former Participant equal to the amount of all employee
contributions made to the Plan by the Participant or former
Participant under § 58-52A, if any, plus interest. The payment
will be made in a lump sum cash distribution as soon as
practicable after the death of the Participant or former
Participant. If the Participant or former Participant failed to
designate a beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary shall
have survived the Participant or former Participant, the benefit
under this paragraph shall be paid to the estate of the
Participant or former Participant.
(b) Interest. For the purposes of Subsection F(4)(a), the term
"interest" shall mean interest from the date of contribution to
the date of distribution at the interest rate set forth in the
definition of "equivalent actuarial value" in § 58-45, as
amended from time to time. (If the interest rate is amended,
the interest rate in effect before the amendment shall be
applicable in computing interest for the period before the
effective date of the amendment, and the interest rate in effect
after the amendment shall be applicable in computing interest
for the period after the effective date of the amendment).
(5) No other death benefits. Except as provided in this Subsection F
and in § 58-49 (relating to elections to receive benefits in the form
of a joint and survivor annuity or a ten-year certain form), no
Participant or former Participant, and no estate or beneficiary of
any Participant or former Participant shall receive any payment or
benefit under this Plan or from the Trust due to the death of a
Participant or former Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
effective January 1, 2007, if a Participant dies while performing
qualified military service [as defined in Section 414(u) of the Code],
the Participant's beneficiary shall be entitled to additional benefits
(including benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified
military service), if any, that would be provided under the Plan had
the Participant resumed employment with the Township's police
force and then terminated employment on account of death.
(6) Beneficiary designations.
§ 58-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-48
1:144
§ 58-49. Optional forms of benefits.
(a) Except as provided in Subsection F(6)(b), a Participant or
former Participant may only designate his surviving spouse
and/or one or more of his children as a contingent annuitant
(death beneficiary) of any benefit under this Plan, or any form
of benefit under § 58-49. If there is no surviving spouse or
child, no benefits shall be paid under this Plan after the death
of the Participant or former Participant, other than any benefits
provided under this § 58-48F(4).
(b) For the limited purposes of § 58-48F(4) (relating to return of
employee contributions) only, a Participant or former
Participant may designate any person or persons as his death
beneficiary and may designate both primary and contingent
beneficiaries.
G. Return of employee contributions.
(1) In general. A Participant or former Participant who suffers a
Disqualifying Event at a time when he/she is not eligible to receive
any benefits under Subsections A through F of this § 58-48, or a
Participant or former Participant who irrevocably waives any and
all benefits under Subsections A through F of this section, will be
entitled to a return of all employee contributions he/she made to
the Plan under § 58-52A, if any, plus interest. The payment will be
made in a lump sum cash distribution as soon as practicable after
the Participant or former Participant files an election to receive a
return of contributions.
(2) Interest. For purposes of Subsection G(1) the term "interest" shall
mean interest from the date of contribution to the date of
distribution at the interest rate set forth in the definition of
"equivalent actuarial value" in § 58-45, as amended from time to
time. (If the interest rate is amended, the interest rate in effect
before the amendment shall be applicable in computing interest for
the period before the effective date of the amendment, and the
interest rate in effect after the amendment shall be applicable in
computing interest for the period after the effective date of the
amendment).
A. Joint and survivor annuity. A Participant or former Participant entitled
to receive a normal retirement benefit, a deferred retirement benefit or
an early retirement benefit may elect to receive such benefit in the form
of a joint and survivor annuity rather than in the form specified in the
applicable subsection of § 58-48 ("life annuity form"). A joint and
survivor annuity is a series of equal monthly payments commencing on
the date the life annuity form would commence, payable to the former
Participant throughout his life and payable after his death to his
designated contingent annuitant (if the contingent annuitant shall
survive the former Participant) until the first day of the month of the
§ 58-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-49
1:145
§ 58-50. Limitation on benefits.
contingent annuitant's death, and of Equivalent Actuarial Value to the
life annuity form. For purposes of the joint and survivor annuity option,
only one contingent annuitant may be designated, and only persons
permitted under § 58-48F(6) may be designated.
B. Ten-year certain. A Participant or former Participant entitled to receive
a normal retirement benefit, a deferred retirement benefit or an early
retirement benefit may elect to receive such benefit in the form of a tenyear
certain annuity rather than in the form specified in the applicable
subsection of § 58-48 ("life annuity form"). A ten-year certain annuity is
a series of equal monthly payments commencing on the date the life
annuity form would commence, payable to the former Participant
throughout his life and, in the event of his death before he receives 120
monthly payments, payable after his death to his designated contingent
annuitants (if living) until a total of 120 monthly payments have been
made to the former Participant and his contingent annuitants, and of
Equivalent Actuarial Value to the life annuity form. For purposes of the
ten-year certain option, only persons permitted under § 58-48F(6) may
be designated as contingent annuitants.
A. Defined benefit dollar limitation. The "defined benefit dollar limitation"
is $195,000, as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under Code
Section 415(d) in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe, and
payable in the form of a straight life annuity. A limitation as adjusted
under Code Section 415(d) will apply to limitation years ending with or
within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies.
B. Defined benefit compensation limitation. The "defined benefit
compensation limitation" is the Participant's or former Participant's
high three-year average compensation. In the case of a Participant who
has had a severance from employment, the defined benefit
compensation limitation applicable to the Participant in any limitation
year beginning after the date of severance from employment shall be
automatically adjusted by multiplying the limitation applicable to the
Participant in the prior limitation year by the annual adjustment factor
under Code Section 415(d).
C. High three-year average compensation. The average compensation for
the three consecutive calendar years of service with the Employer that
produces the highest average. In the case of a Participant who is
rehired by the Employer after a severance from employment, the
Participant's high three-year average compensation shall be calculated
by excluding all years for which the Participant performs no services for
and receives no compensation from the Employer (the break period)
and by treating the years immediately preceding and following the
break period as consecutive. For purposes of this § 58-50, a
Participant's compensation shall mean wages, within the meaning of
Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an
Employee by the Company (in the course of the Company's trade or
§ 58-49 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-50
1:146
business) for which the Company is required to furnish the Participant
a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052.
Compensation shall be determined without regard to any rules under
Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages
based on the nature or location of the employment or services
performed. Compensation paid or made available during a limitation
year shall include amounts that would otherwise be included as
compensation but for a Participant's election under Code Sections
125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k) or 457(b). Effective January 1,
2008, and solely for purposes of this § 58-50, compensation shall also
include compensation paid by the later of 2 1/2 months after a
Participant's severance from employment or the end of the calendar
year that includes the date of the Participant's severance from
employment, if the payment is regular compensation for service during
the Participant's regular working hours, or compensation for services
outside the Participant's regular working hours (such as overtime or
shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar payments,
and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have
been paid to the Participant while the Participant continued in
employment with the Employer. Any payments not described above
shall not be considered compensation if paid after severance from
employment, even if they are paid by the later of 2 1/2 months after
the date of severance from employment or the end of the calendar
year that includes the date of severance from employment. Back pay,
within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be
treated as compensation for the calendar year to which the back pay
relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation
that would otherwise be included under this definition. A Participant's
compensation for a calendar year of service shall not include
compensation in excess of the limitation under Code Section 401(a)(17)
that is in effect for the calendar year in which such year of service
begins.
D. Maximum permissible benefit. The "maximum permissible benefit" is
the lesser of the defined benefit dollar limitation or the defined benefit
compensation limitation (both adjusted where required, as provided in
Subsection E and, if applicable, in Subsections F or G below).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, when
expressed as a monthly pension in the form of a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits) over the life of a Participant or former
Participant, a pension benefit hereunder shall not exceed the lesser of
(1) the defined benefit dollar limitation divided by 12, or (2) 100% of the
participants monthly defined benefit compensation limitation. The
maximum shall apply to any pension payable to the Participant or
former Participant as a joint and survivor annuity without any actuarial
reduction.
E. If the participant has fewer than 10 years of participation in the plan,
the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of
§ 58-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-50
1:147
participation in the plan and the denominator of which is 10. In the
case of a participant who has fewer than 10 years of service with
the employer, the defined benefit compensation limitation shall be
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years
(or part thereof) of service with the employer and the denominator of
which is 10.
F. If the benefit of a participant begins prior to age 62, the defined benefit
dollar limitation applicable to the participant at such earlier age is an
annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at
the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit
dollar limitation applicable to the participant at age 62 (adjusted under
Subsection D above, if required). The defined benefit dollar limitation
applicable at an age prior to age 62 is computed using a 5% interest
rate and the applicable mortality table as defined in Rev. Rul. 2001-62
or, for distributions prior to January 1, 2008, computed using the
interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in
the definition of "equivalent actuarial value" in § 58-45 of the Plan if
lesser. Any decrease in the defined benefit dollar limitation determined
in accordance with this Subsection E shall not reflect a mortality
decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the
participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality
decrement is taken into account.
G. If the benefit of a participant begins after the participant attains age 65,
the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable to the participant at
the later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life
annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the
Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable to the participant at age 65
(adjusted under Subsection D above, if required). The actuarial
equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age
after age 65 is computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable
mortality table as defined in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 or, for distributions prior
to January 1, 2008, computed using the interest rate and mortality table
(or other tabular factor) specified in the definition of "equivalent
actuarial value" in § 58-45 of the Plan if lesser. For these purposes,
mortality between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence shall
be ignored.
H. For all purposes of this Plan, the maximum defined benefit dollar
limitation shall be automatically increased as permitted by Treasury
Department regulations to reflect cost-of-living adjustments. As a result
of such an adjustment, a pension which had been limited by the
provisions of this § 58-50 in a previous plan year may be increased with
respect to future payments to the lesser of the adjusted defined benefit
dollar limitation amount or the amount of pension which would have
been payable under this Plan without regard to the provisions of this
§ 58-50.
I. The limitations described in this § 58-50 are intended to comply with
the provisions of Code Section 415, as amended, so that the maximum
§ 58-50 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-50
1:148
§ 58-51. Benefits: miscellaneous provisions.
benefits provided by plans of the Employer shall be exactly equal to the
maximum amounts allowed under Code Section 415 and the regulations
thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this
§ 58-50 and the provisions of Code Section 415 and the regulations
thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give
full effect to the provisions of Code Section 415 and the regulations
thereunder.
A. Accrued benefit.
(1) The "accrued benefit" as of any given date ("calculation date") of a
Participant or former Participant who has never suffered a
Disqualifying Event or who has returned to employment with the
Employer since his most recent Disqualifying Event, and who is not
yet qualified to receive any Plan benefits with respect to his current
period of employment if he terminates his employment with the
Employer, shall be an amount equal to:
(a) The Equivalent Actuarial Value as of the calculation date of an
annuity of equal monthly payments commencing on the first
date a normal retirement benefit would commence if the
Participant or former Participant continues in the employ of the
Employer until he is entitled to receive a normal retirement
benefit with respect to his current period of employment, and
continuing until the first day of the month following his death,
in an amount equal to 1.5% of his Final Average Monthly
Compensation, multiplied by his number of Years of Benefit
Accrual Service as of a Calculation Date prior to January 1,
2006 and 2% of his Final Average Monthly Compensation
multiplied by his number of Years of Benefit Accrual Service as
of a calculation date after January 1, 2006; plus
(b) The Equivalent Actuarial Value as of the calculation date of all
Plan benefits to which the Participant or former Participant is
entitled for periods of service ending on or before the date of
any Disqualifying Event which occurred before the calculation
date; less
(c) The Equivalent Actuarial Value of all Plan benefits which have
already been paid.
(2) The "accrued benefit" as of any given date ("calculation date") of a
Participant or former Participant other than a person described in
Subsection A(1) shall be an amount equal to the Equivalent
Actuarial Value as of the calculation date of all Plan benefits which
the Participant or former Participant is entitled to receive at any
time, assuming for such purposes that any such Participant or
former Participant who has never suffered a Disqualifying Event or
who has returned to employment with the Employer since his most
§ 58-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-51
1:149
recent Disqualifying Event terminates his employment with the
Employer on the calculation date, less the Equivalent Actuarial
Value of all Plan benefits which have already been paid.
B. Production of information. Before any payment shall be made under this
Plan to or on account of a Participant or former Participant, the
recipient of such payment shall file with or make available to the
Committee such information as the Committee may from time to time
require to determine the recipient's rights and benefits under the Plan.
C. Notice of benefit options. The Committee shall provide a Participant or
former Participant with written notice of the benefit options which are
available to him under the Plan and of the procedures for obtaining
such benefits within a reasonable time after the Participant or former
Participant expresses an interest in retirement, and also approximately
three months before the Participant or former Participant would first
become eligible to receive a normal retirement benefit.
D. Election of benefits and benefit options. All applications for benefit
payments, elections to receive optional forms of benefits, and
beneficiary (contingent annuitant) designations shall be made on forms
supplied by the Committee and within such reasonable periods of time
as may be prescribed by the Committee. The time provided in this Plan
for the commencement of any benefits shall be subject to compliance
with the requirements of Subsection B and this Subsection D.
E. No benefit increases following termination. The amount of benefits to
which a Participant or former Participant may be entitled under this
Plan with respect to any continuous period of employment with the
Employer (whether as a Qualified Employee or not) or any consecutive
periods of employment in which a Disqualifying Event has not occurred
between the beginning of the first of such periods and the day before
the end of the last of such periods, shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Plan in effect on the last day in which the
Participant or former Participant worked for the Employer during such
period or during the last of such consecutive periods. Such amount
shall not be affected by benefit increases which become effective
thereafter.
F. Latest commencement of benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Plan, distribution of benefits under this Plan with
respect to any Participant or former Participant shall commence no
later than the later of:
(1) April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which
the Participant or former Participant attains age 70 1/2; or
(2) April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which
the Participant or former Participant ceases to be employed by the
Employer.
§ 58-51 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-51
1:150
G. Compliance with Code Section 401(a)(9). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Plan, all distributions of Plan benefits
must comply with the provisions of Code Section 401(a)(9) (or any
successor provision of any future federal internal revenue law) and the
regulations issued thereunder, and the incidental death benefit rules of
the Internal Revenue Service. If a form of benefits (including the
selection of a beneficiary/contingent annuitant) elected by a Participant
or former Participant would violate those provisions, regulations or
rules, but another form is available under the terms of this Plan which
would not, the Participant or former Participant must elect a form
which would not violate those provisions, regulations or rules.
Otherwise, the optional forms of benefits available under this Plan shall
be modified as follows, to the extent necessary to comply with those
provisions, regulations and rules:
(1) A joint and survivor annuity form may be altered by reducing the
monthly amount under the survivor annuity below 100% of the
monthly amount paid during the former Participant's life.
(2) A ten-year certain form may be altered by reducing the duration of
the period certain.
H. Direct rollover.
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that
would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by
the Administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution that is equal to at least $500 paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
(2) For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:
(a) An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee,
except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:
any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of
10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); the
portion of any other distribution that is not includible in gross
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities);
any hardship distribution described in Code Section
401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) made after December 31, 1999; and any
other distribution that is reasonably expected to total less than
$200 during a year. Effective January 1, 2002, a portion of a
distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution
§ 58-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-51
1:151
merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee
contributions which are not includible in gross income;
provided, however, such portion may be transferred only to
(i) an individual retirement account or annuity described in
Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code; (ii) for taxable years
beginning before January 1, 2007, a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of
the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution that is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution that is not so includible; or (iii) for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, a qualified
trust or to an annuity contract described in Section 403(b)
of the Code if such trust or contract provides for separate
accounting for amounts so transferred (including interest
thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of
such distribution which is includible in gross income and the
portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
(b) An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement
account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual
retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an
annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), or a qualified
trust described in Code Section 401(a), that accepts the
distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case
of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an
"eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account
or individual retirement annuity. Effective for distributions
made after December 31, 2001, an "eligible retirement plan"
shall also mean an annuity contract described in Code Section
403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is
maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any
agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a
state and which agrees to separately account for amounts
transferred into such plan from this Plan. Effective for
distributions made after December 31, 2001, an "eligible
retirement plan" shall also apply in the case of a distribution to
a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the
alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as
defined in Code Section 414(p). Effective January 1, 2008, an
"eligible retirement plan" shall also mean a Roth IRA described
in Code Section 408A.
(c) A "distributee" includes an Employee or former Employee. In
addition, the Employee's or former Employee's surviving
spouse and the Employee's or former Employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p),
are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or
former spouse. Effective for distributions made on or after
§ 58-51 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-51
1:152
§ 58-52. Employer and employee contributions.
January 1, 2010, "distributee" shall also mean the Employee's
nonspouse designated beneficiary; provided, however, that the
direct rollover for a nonspouse designated beneficiary may
be made only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Code Sections 408(a) or 408(b) that is established
on behalf of the Employee's nonspouse designated beneficiary
and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the
provisions of Code Section 402(c)(11).
(d) A "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
A. Employee contributions. Each Participant shall contribute an amount
equal to 1% of his Compensation to the Trust. The contributions under
this Subsection A shall be paid by having the Employer pay each
Participant only 99% of the amount of Compensation he/she would
otherwise receive in each paycheck. Although all contributions under
this Subsection A are hereby designated as employee contributions,
they shall be made through salary reductions and thus paid by the
Employer as "pick up" contributions under Code Section 414(h)(2) so
that they are not subject to federal income tax at the time of the
contribution, but only when Plan benefits are paid. (Note: although pick
up contributions are not subject to current federal income tax, they are
considered "wages" subject to current FICA taxation and also current
income for Pennsylvania state and local income taxes.) A Qualified
Employee shall not have the option of receiving the amount of employee
contributions required under this Subsection A directly instead of
having them paid by the Employer to the Plan. This subsection shall be
construed to include all requirements necessary to satisfy the
provisions of Code Section 414(h)(2).
B. Employee contributions — military service. Notwithstanding
Subsection A, no Participant shall be required to make any
contributions to this Plan during any period of service in the uniformed
services of the United States. If such a Participant returns to
employment with the Employer, he/she shall contribute to the Plan an
amount equal to the rate in effect under Subsection A for the period of
uniformed service multiplied by the deemed Compensation of the
Participant for such period. (Where more than one rate is in effect
during the period of uniformed service, a calculation shall be performed
for each portion of the period of uniformed service governed by a
separate rate, and the total required contribution shall be equal to the
sum of such calculations). The contribution shall be made during the
period beginning with the date of reemployment and whose duration is
the lesser of (1) three times the period of the person's service in the
uniformed services, or (2) five years. If the Participant fails or refuses to
make the contribution required under this Subsection B, he shall forfeit
§ 58-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-52
1:153
§ 58-53. Administration and management of plan and trust.
all benefits under this Plan which are based on service during the
period for which the required employee contributions were not made.
C. Employer contributions. The Employer shall, from time to time,
contribute to the Plan and Trust the amounts required, after taking into
account the mandatory employee contributions under Subsection A, to
fund all the benefits provided under the Plan according to the
calculations of the Pension Consultant, and as required by the
Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act, 53 P.S.
§ 895.101 et seq. Employer contributions may be derived from grants of
state aid, disbursements from the Township's general fund and other

which event the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of
such action and the name or names of its member or members so

document executed by such member or members as representing
action by the Committee until the Committee shall file with the
Trustee a written revocation of such designation. The Committee
may adopt such by-laws and regulations as it deems desirable for
the conduct of its affairs, and may appoint such accountants,
consultants and other persons as it may deem necessary or
§ 58-52 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-53
1:154
desirable in connection with the administration of this Plan. The
Committee shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon, and shall be
fully protected in any action taken by it in good faith in relying

such accountant, counsel or other consultants.
(3) Powers and duties. The Committee shall administer the Plan in
accordance with its terms, shall direct the Trustee to make the

proceedings and acts, and shall keep all such books of account,
records and other data as may be necessary for the proper
administration of the Plan. The Committee shall notify the Trustee
and the Employer of any action taken by the Committee and, when
required, shall notify any other interested person or persons.
(5) Payment of expenses. Unless otherwise determined by the
Commissioners, the members of the Committee shall serve without
compensation for services as such, but all expenses of the
Committee shall be paid by the Trust or the Employer in such
manner as the Employer shall determine. Such expenses shall
include any expenses incident to the functioning of the Committee,

consultants and other specialists, and any other costs of
administering the Plan.
(6) Immunity from liability; indemnification. No member of the
Committee shall incur any liability for any action or failure to act
except with respect to his own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Employer shall and does hereby indemnify each
member of the Committee against any and all claims, losses,
damages, expenses and liabilities arising from any action or failure
to act, except when the same is judicially determined to be due to
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such member. In
addition, the Committee and any member or agent thereof shall be
fully protected in relying upon the advice of any counsel, consultant
or actuary appointed by the Committee or the Employer.
B. The Trust.
(1) In general. All of the funds of this Plan shall be held by a corporate

accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement which follows
§ 58-56,7 as it may be amended from time to time. Said Trust
Agreement is incorporated herein by reference. The Trust created
§ 58-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-53
1:155
§ 58-54. Amendment.
or existing under the Trust Agreement shall be a part of this
Plan for use in providing the benefits of this Plan and paying any
expenses not directly paid by the Employer. Neither the Employer,
the Committee, nor the Commissioners shall have any
responsibility for the administration of the Trust funds or any
liability for any loss with respect thereto.
(2) Rights in Trust funds. No part of the corpus or income of the Trust
shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive
benefit of Participants, former Participants, and contingent
annuitants of this Plan prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities
under this Plan with respect to such persons. No person shall have
any interest in or right to any part of the earnings or assets of the
Trust except as and to the extent expressly provided in this Plan
and in the Trust Agreement.
(3) Source of Plan benefits. The Trust is designed to be and shall be the
sole source of the benefits provided under the Plan. The Employer
does not guarantee such benefits or payments or assume any
obligation with respect thereto other than to pay the contributions
provided under § 58-52 into the Trust.
(4) Trustee. The Commissioners hereby reaffirm the appointment of
Wells Fargo Bank as Trustee of the Trust.
(5) No funding by individual policies. The Plan shall not be funded on
an individual insurance policy basis.
C. Pension Consultant. The Commissioners hereby appoint Conrad Siegel
Actuaries as the Pension Consultant to the Plan and Trust to serve at
the pleasure of the Commissioners.
D. Nondiscrimination. Whenever there is a choice or decision to be made
by the Employer or the Committee in connection with the
administration of the Plan, the result shall be uniformly applied then
and thereafter in all similar circumstances so that there shall be no
discrimination in the operation of the Plan.
A. The Commissioners may by ordinance at any time and from time to time
modify or amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the
Plan and/or Trust Agreement, including the method of financing the
Plan, provided that:
(1) No modification or amendment may be made which would have the
effect of depriving any retired former Participant or contingent
annuitant receiving a retirement benefit of any benefits under the
Plan to which he would otherwise be entitled by reason of the
7. Editor's Note: The Trust Agreement is on file in the Township offices.
§ 58-53 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-54
1:156
§ 58-55. Termination and merger.
accumulated funds held under the Plan at that time, unless such
former Participant or contingent annuitant consents thereto;
(2) No modification or amendment may be made which would cause
the accrued benefit (see § 58-51A) of any Participant or former
Participant to be lower at any time after the modification or
amendment than it was immediately before the amendment, except
that any portion of the accrued benefit which is attributable to a
nonvested period may be reduced or eliminated as of any date after
the end of such period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a
"nonvested period" shall mean any period of time ending with a
Disqualifying Event and beginning the day after the previous
Disqualifying Event (or, in the case of the period which ends with
the first Disqualifying Event suffered by the Participant or former
Participant, beginning the first day of employment with the
Employer), provided that the Participant or former Participant had
less than seven Years of Vesting Service as of the last day of the
period;
(3) No modification or amendment may be made which would increase
the number of years specified in § 58-48E(1) to qualify for the
vested benefit, or would otherwise change the vesting schedule of
the Plan (currently 0% for six or fewer Years of Vesting Service and
100% for seven or more Years of Vesting Service) to the potential
detriment of any Participant;
(4) No such modification or amendment shall make it possible for any
part of the funds of the Plan to be used for or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants, former
Participants and contingent annuitants under the Plan prior to the
satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to them; and
(5) No such modification or amendment shall make it possible for the
Employer to appoint to the position of Trustee anyone other than a
corporate trustee.
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any modifications or amendments of
the Plan may be made by ordinance, retroactively if necessary, which
the Commissioners may deem necessary or appropriate to make the
Plan conform to the requirements of any law or governmental
regulation now or hereafter enacted or promulgated, or to qualify the
Plan and Trust as exempt under existing or future federal, state or local
income tax or estate tax laws and regulations.
A. Right of termination. Although the Employer expects and desires that
this Plan shall be permanent, it reserves the right to terminate the Plan
for any reason at any time and discontinue contributions to this Plan, to
the extent permitted by state and federal law.
§ 58-54 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-55
1:157
B. Use of funds upon termination. In case of termination of this Plan, all
active Participants who are accruing benefits shall become fully vested
in their accrued benefits, and the funds of the Plan and Trust shall be
used for the exclusive benefit of Participants, former Participants and
contingent annuitants to the extent of their rights under the Plan.
However, if the Employer, because of erroneous actuarial calculations,
shall have contributed funds in excess of the amount required to satisfy
all liabilities of the Plan for benefits, then such excess shall be returned
to the Employer.
C. Order of payments. In the event this Plan is terminated or the Employer
discontinues making contributions to this Plan, the Committee shall
determine the share of the funds of the Plan and Trust allocable to each
Participant, former Participant and contingent annuitant in the
following order, except as may be required by rule, regulation or
direction of the Internal Revenue Service, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation or the Pennsylvania Auditor General's office:
(1) Any accrued benefits (see § 58-51A) that Participants, former
Participants or contingent annuitants have accrued to the date of
termination or discontinuance of contributions, to the extent that
these benefits are then funded or credited to their individual
accounts, shall be nonforfeitable and payable to them. If the funds
of the Plan are insufficient to provide for all accrued benefits in full,
each benefit shall be reduced pro rata.
(2) To the extent that such accrued benefits are not funded or credited
on an individual basis, they shall be payable in the following order:
(a) Each retired former Participant or his contingent annuitant
receiving a retirement benefit and each Participant or former
Participant who has not yet retired from employment with the
Employer but who is entitled to retire and receive a normal
retirement benefit shall be entitled to a benefit equal to the
reserve computed to be required to provide his full accrued
benefits. If the funds of the Plan and Trust are insufficient to
provide in full for all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(a),
then all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(a) shall be reduced
pro rata.
(b) After the benefits under the provisions of Subsection C(2)(a)
above have been set aside in full, each other person entitled to
a benefit hereunder shall be entitled to a benefit equal to the
reserve computed to be required to provide his accrued
benefits. If the funds of the Plan and Trust are insufficient to
prove in full for all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(b), then
all benefits under this Subsection C(2)(b) shall be reduced pro
rata.
D. Form of termination payments. To the extent permitted by law, the
Committee may require that all assets of the Trust be paid following the
§ 58-55 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-55
1:158
§ 58-56. Miscellaneous provisions.
termination of the Plan (or the complete discontinuance of Employer
contributions to the Plan) in cash, in immediate annuities, in deferred
annuities or in other periodic payment forms, or in one of such forms
permitted by the Committee and elected by the recipient.
E. Merger.
(1) For purposes of this Subsection E, the term "merger" shall mean
any merger or consolidation of this Plan and/or the Trust with any
other plan, or any transfer of the assets or liabilities of this Plan
and/or the Trust to any other plan.
(2) The terms of any merger must specify that if this Plan or its
successor were to terminate immediately after the merger, each
Participant and former Participant shall receive a benefit which is
not less than he would have received in the event this Plan
terminated immediately before such merger.
A. No other legal rights conferred by plan. The establishment and
maintenance of this Plan shall not be construed as conferring any legal
rights upon employees or other persons to a continuation of
employment with the Employer nor shall it interfere with the rights of
the Employer to discharge any person or to treat him without regard to
the effect which such treatment might have upon him as a Participant
or former Participant in the Plan.
B. Spendthrift provisions. No benefit under this Plan shall be subject in
any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,
pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to do so shall be void,
except as specifically provided in this Plan, nor shall any such benefit be
in any manner liable for or subject to garnishment, attachment,
execution, levy or other legal process for the collection of debts, or
liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or
torts of the person entitled to such benefit. In the event the Committee
shall find that any Participant, former Participant or contingent
annuitant under this Plan has become incompetent, bankrupt or
insolvent, or that any attempt has been made to anticipate, alienate,
sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any of his benefits
under the Plan, except as specifically provided in the Plan, then such
benefit shall cease and terminate and in such event the Committee and
the Trustee shall hold or apply the same to or for the benefit of such
Participant, former Participant or contingent annuitant, his spouse,
children or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner as the
Committee may find proper from time to time.
C. Right to inspect documents. Notwithstanding any information that is
made available by the Employer, Committee, or Trustee to any person
through the distribution of descriptive booklets, bulletin board notices,
payroll notices or oral announcements, any Participant or former
§ 58-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-56
1:159
Participant may examine the Plan as presented in this article and
amendments thereto, and the Trust Agreement and all amendments
thereto, at the main office of the Employer at such mutually convenient
time as is arranged by the Participant or former Participant and a
representative of the Employer, Committee or Trustee.
D. Severability. In the event that any provision, section, sentence, clause
or part of this Plan shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable, such
invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect or impair any remaining
provision, section, sentence, clause or part of this Plan, it being the
intent of the Commissioners of the Township that such remainder be
and remain in full force and effect.
E. Construction. When used herein, the masculine shall include the
feminine and neuter, as appropriate.
F. Governing law. This Plan shall be construed, regulated, and
administered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
the applicable laws of the United States of America.

§ 58-57. Establishment of plan.
The Commissioners of the Township of South Whitehall hereby establish the
South Whitehall Township Nonuniformed Employees Defined Contribution
Pension Plan in the form provided in this article.
§ 58-58. Definitions.
When used in this article with initial capital letters, the words and phrases
defined below shall have the following meanings, unless the context in
which they are used clearly indicates a different meaning.
ACCOUNTING DATE — The last day of each Plan Year.
ADMINISTRATOR — The Plan Administrator described in § 58-74.
ALTERNATE PAYEE — A person entitled to receive, by virtue of a Qualified
Domestic Relations Order (see § 58-70D), some of the benefits under this
Plan of a Participant.
AUTHORIZED LEAVE OF ABSENCE — Any absence authorized by the
Employer under the Employer's standard personnel practices, provided
that all persons under similar circumstances must be treated alike in the
granting of such leaves. An absence due to service in the uniformed services
of the United States shall be considered an Authorized Leave of Absence if
the employee complies with all of the requirements of federal law in order
to be entitled to reemployment and in fact does return to employment with
the Employer within the period provided by law.
BENEFICIARY — A person who has the right to receive benefits under this
Plan as a result of the death of a Participant or Alternate Payee. (See § 58-67
for the method by which Participants may designate their beneficiaries).
CODE — The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Title 26, U.S.
Code). Reference to a section of the Code shall mean that section as it
may be amended or renumbered from time to time, or any corresponding
provision of any future legislation that amends, supplements or supersedes
that section.
COMPENSATION —
In general. Except as provided in Subsections B through E of this
definition, the "Compensation" of a Qualified Employee for a given year
(or other period for which a determination is being made) shall mean
the Qualified Employee's total Wages from the Employer actually paid,
made available, or includible in gross income for the year (or other
determination period).
A.
B. Adjustments.
§ 58-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-58
1:161
Certain nontaxable compensation. Except as provided in
Subsection B(2), "Compensation" for a given year (or other
determination period) shall also include amounts that would
otherwise be includible in the Qualified Employee's gross income
for the given year (or other determination period) but for the
application of Code § 125 (relating to cafeteria plans), Code § 457
(relating to compensation deferred under an eligible deferred
compensation plan for state and local governments and tax exempt
organizations), Code § 414(h)(2) (relating to employee
contributions to governmental plans that are picked up by the
employing unit and thus are treated as employer contributions),
or Code § 132(f)(4) (relating to qualified transportation fringes),
or any elective deferrals [within the meaning of Code § 402(g)(3)]
for the given year (or other determination period), but only with
respect to contributions made to plans maintained by the Employer.
(1)
Cash payments for waiver of benefits. "Compensation" shall not
include cash payments made through a cafeteria plan due to the
full or partial waiver of health or other coverage, even though
such payments are includible in the Qualified Employee's Wages or
gross income. The purpose of this Subsection B is to insure that a
Participant shall receive the same pension benefits under this Plan
regardless of whether the Participant elects through a cafeteria
plan to receive health or other coverage or waive the receipt of
such coverage, and regardless of the health or other coverage
options he/she elects through a cafeteria plan. "Compensation" is
the same as it would be if the Employer had maintained coverages
which covered all Qualified Employees, required no employee
contributions, and provided no incentives to Qualified Employees
to select any particular coverage option.
(2)
Compensation during periods of uniformed service. In the case of a
period during which a Qualified Employee is serving in the uniformed
services of the United States, the employee's "Compensation" shall be
computed:
At the rate the Qualified Employee would have received but for the
uniformed service; or
(1)
In the case that the determination of such rate is not reasonably
certain, on the basis of the Qualified Employee's average rate
of Compensation during the twelve-month period immediately
preceding the period of uniformed service (or, if shorter, the period
of employment immediately preceding such period).
(2)
C.
Maximum amount which may be treated as compensation.
General rule. The "Compensation" of a Qualified Employee for any
given Plan Year shall not exceed the amount in effect for such year
under Code § 401(a)(17), as adjusted for changes in the cost of
living. (For any year beginning in 2015, the amount is $265,000.).

under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order).

this Plan, and their successors.
ERISA — The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (P.L.

time to time, or any corresponding provision of any future legislation that
amends, supplements, or supersedes that section.

disposition of Plan assets; or who renders investment advice for a fee
or other direct or indirect compensation with respect to any monies or
property of the Plan or has any authority or responsibility to do so; or
has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the
administration of the Plan.
INVESTMENT MANAGER — An investment manager appointed under
§ 58-72F.
NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE — Age 65.
PARTICIPANT — An "Active Participant" or an "Inactive Participant":
Short years. If Compensation is ever required to be determined for
a period of time which contains fewer than 12 months, the amount
in effect for such period under Code § 401(a)(17) shall be equal
to the amount in effect under Code § 401(a)(17) for the calendar
year in which the period begins, multiplied by a fraction whose
numerator is equal to the number of months in the period, and
whose denominator is equal to 12.
(2)

provisions. For purposes of § 58-63 (relating to Maximum Additions),
the term "Compensation" shall be modified as described in § 58-63A.

SEPARATION FROM SERVICE —
In general. The term "Separation from Service" shall mean the end of
a continuous period of employment of a given person by the Employer
(or any Related Employer) and may result from retirement, death,
resignation, involuntary termination, unauthorized absence, or by
failure to return to active employment with the Employer (or any
Related Employer) or to retire by the date on which an Authorized
Leave of Absence expires. For purposes of the preceding sentence only,
periods of Authorized Leaves of Absence and temporary layoffs are
considered to be periods of employment by the Employer. A person
"Separates from Service" if he incurs a Separation from Service.
A.
Temporary layoffs. If the Employer (or any Related Employer) shall
terminate a person's employment due to insufficient work for such
person and shall indicate that the termination is temporary and that
the Employer (or Related Employer) anticipates being able to re-employ
the person within six months, the termination shall be considered a
"temporary lay-off" and not a "Separation from Service." In that case, if
the person does not return to active employment with the Employer (or
any Related Employer) immediately upon recall and within six months,
he shall incur a "Separation from Service" as of the earlier of:
(1) The date specified in any recall as the date to return to work; or
(2) The date six months after the temporary layoff began.
B.
Transfers among related employers. The term "Separation from
Service" shall not include transfers between employers all of whom are
included within the definition of "Employer" or "Related Employer," or
the mere cessation of a person's status as a "Qualified Employee" if he
remains in the employment of the Employer (or any Related Employer).
C.
Sale of business.
A person shall not incur a "Separation from Service" if the
Employer or any Related Employer sells the trade or business for
which the person performs services to an unrelated purchaser, but
the person continues to work for the trade or business. Thereafter,
the person shall incur a "Separation from Service" if he does so
under the provisions of this definition as modified by substituting
the purchaser of the trade or business (and his related employers)
for the Employer (and Related Employers).

any rules under Code § 3401(a) that limit covered employment based on the
nature or location of the employment or the services performed [such as the
exception for agricultural labor in Code § 3401(a)(2)]. (This amount is the

W-2 for federal income tax purposes.)
A person shall not incur a "Separation from Service" if the
corporation for which he works shall cease to be included within
the definition of "Employer" or "Related Employer" (e.g., through
the sale of its stock), but the person continues to work for the
corporation. Thereafter, the person shall incur a "Separation from
Service" if he does so under the provisions of this definition as
modified by substituting the corporation for which he works (and
its related employers) for the Employer (and Related Employers).

service in the uniformed services of the United States and who could
be entitled to reemployment with the Employer under the Uniformed
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38 U.S.C.
§ 4301 et seq., following the completion of such service, the person
shall incur a Separation from Service (and be entitled to commence
the receipt of Plan benefits) as of the earliest of the following dates: 1)
the date elected by the person (which may not be earlier than the date
the person files the election with the Administrator); 2) the date of the
person's death; or 3) the date the Administrator determines that the
person no longer is legally entitled to reemployment with the Employer,
provided that if the person complies with all of the requirements of
federal law in order to be entitled to reemployment and does in fact
return to employment with the Employer within the period provided
by law, the person shall thereafter be treated as not having incurred
a Separation from Service with respect to the period of uniformed
service. The person shall not be required or permitted to return any
benefits received from the Plan prior to his return to employment with
the Employer.

§ 58-59. Participation and service.
A. In general. In order to be eligible to become an Active Participant in this
Plan, a person must be a Qualified Employee. The eligible person shall
become an Active Participant at the time provided in Subsection B, and
shall remain an Active Participant only so long as he remains a Qualified
Employee. After he ceases to be a Qualified Employee, he shall become
an Inactive Participant until all of his Plan accounts are distributed, or
until he becomes an Active Participant again.
B. Entry date.
(1) In general. A person shall become an Active Participant as of the
first day the person satisfies the eligibility requirements of
Subsection A.
(2) Rehired employees. Subject to Subsection B(3), a person who
Separates from Service and who later returns to employment with
the Employer as a Qualified Employee shall become an Active
Participant again upon his/her return to employment with the
Employer as a Qualified Employee. A person who ceases to be a
Qualified Employee but does not Separate from Service, and who
becomes a Qualified Employee again, shall become an Active
Participant again on the date he becomes a Qualified Employee
again.
(3) Uniformed service. A Qualified Employee who Separates from
Service as a result of service in the uniformed services of the
United States and who returns to employment with the Employer at
a time when the Employer is legally obligated to reemploy the
person under the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38 U.S.C. § 4301 et seq., shall be
treated as not having incurred that Separation from Service, shall
be treated as having been a Qualified Employee during the period
of such uniformed service, and shall be treated as having remained
an Active Participant during the period of such uniformed service.
C. Required information. The Administrator may require a Qualified
Employee to submit relevant information to the Plan in connection with
his entry into participation in this Plan. The Administrator shall be fully
protected from any loss which may result from the Qualified Employee's
failure to submit such information or from the Plan's reliance on
incorrect information.
D. Year of service.
(1) In general. A person is credited with one Year of Service for each
Computation Period (see Subsection F) during which he is credited
with at least 1,000 Hours of Service (see Subsection G). The Year is
generally credited as of the end of the Computation Period.
However, if a person Separated from Service during the
Computation Period and had already been credited with at least
§ 58-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-59
1:167
1,000 Hours of Service, the Year will credited as of the date of the
Separation from Service.
(2) Service before age 18. Notwithstanding Subsection D(1), a person
shall not be credited with a Year of Service for a Computation
Period if he has not attained age 18 by the end of the Computation
Period.
(3) Cancellation of years of service. Years of Service may be cancelled
if a person incurs a Lengthy Break in Service [see Subsection E(2)].
Specifically, all Years of Service credited to a person as of the last
day before a Lengthy Break in Service shall be cancelled as of the
later of:
(a) The date the person incurs the Lengthy Break in Service;
(b) The date he/she Separates from Service; or
(c) The date he/she has no vested right to any portion of his/her
accounts in the Plan, or has a zero balance in such accounts.
E. Break in service.
(1) In general. A person incurs a Break in Service if he is not credited
with more than 500 Hours of Service [see Subsection E(3)] during a
Computation Period (see Subsection F).
(2) Lengthy Breaks in Service.
(a) A person incurs a Lengthy Break in Service if he incurs a Break
in Service in each of a number of consecutive Computation
Periods (see Subsection F) equal to the greater of:
[1] Five years; or
[2] The number of Years of Service credited to the person as of
the beginning of the series of consecutive Breaks in
Service.
(b) The Lengthy Break in Service is incurred at the end of the
above series of consecutive Computation Periods.
(3) Hours of service: special rule.
(a) In general. For purposes of this Subsection E only, the term
"Hours of Service" shall mean:
[1] Each hour credited to a person under Subsection G
(relating to Hours of Service); plus
[2] Each hour for which the person normally would have
received credit under Subsection E but for the fact that the
person was absent on a Parental Leave [see Subsection
§ 58-59 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-59
1:168
E(4)]. (If normal hours cannot be determined, then eight
hours shall be credited for each day.)
(b) Limitation. No more than 501 hours shall be credited under
Subsection E(3)(a)[2] for any one period of Parental Leave.
(c) Computation period to which parental leave is credited. If a
person is credited with fewer than 501 hours under Subsection
E(3)(a)[1] for the Computation Period in which his/her Parental
Leave begins, all of the hours credited under Subsection
E(3)(a)[2] for any one period of Parental Leave shall be
credited in the Computation Period in which his/her Parental
Leave begins. Otherwise, all of the hours credited under
Subsection E(3)(a)[2] for any one period of Parental Leave
shall be credited in the first Computation Period after the
Computation Period in which the person's Parental Leave
begins.
(4) Parental leave.
(a) In general. For purposes of this Subsection E, a "Parental
Leave" occurs when a person is absent from work or
terminates employment due to:
[1] Her pregnancy;
[2] The birth of his or her child;
[3] The placement of a child in connection with its adoption by
him or her; or
[4] The caring of such a child during the period immediately
following its birth or placement for adoption.
(b) Administrative determination. The Administrator shall
determine whether a person's termination of employment or
absence from work is due to a Parental Leave and the duration
of such Leave based on information provided to the
Administrator by the person. All information required by the
Administrator to determine whether a Parental Leave has
occurred shall be provided within such reasonable time, and all
determinations under this section shall be made under such
reasonable rules, as the Administrator may establish for each
group of persons similarly situated. Nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to affect in any way the Employer's
employment policy with respect to Parental Leaves.
F. Computation period. Computation Periods shall be determined
separately for each person. Each of the following periods of time shall
constitute a Computation Period for any given person:
§ 58-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-59
1:169
(1) The one-year period which begins on the first day the person is
credited with one Hour of Service under Subsection G for the
performance of duties.
(2) Each one-year period which begins on an anniversary of the period
described in Subsection F(1) and before the person has service
cancelled under Subsection D(3).
(3) The one-year period which begins on the first day the person is
credited with one Hour of Service under Subsection G(1) after
service during a prior period of employment was cancelled for
purposes of this Plan [see § 204D(3)].
(4) Each one-year period which begins on an anniversary of the period
described in Subsection F(3) and before the person has service
cancelled again under Subsection D(3).
G. Hour of service. A person is credited with an Hour of Service for each of
the following, as administered in accordance with the rules set forth in
Section 2530.200b-2 of the Department of Labor Regulations relating to
Minimum Standards for Employee Benefit Plans (Title 29, Code of
Federal Regulations):
(1) Work time: each hour for which the person is paid, or entitled to
payment, for the performance of duties for the Employer or any
Related Employer (regardless of whether the Related Employer has
adopted this Plan). These hours will be credited to the employee for
the computation period in which the duties are performed;
(2) Compensated time off: each hour, up to 501 hours for any single
continuous period, during which the person performs no duties but
is directly or indirectly paid or entitled to payment by the Employer
or any Related Employer (regardless of whether employment has
terminated) due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity (including
disability), layoff, jury duty, military duty or leave of absence;
excluding, however, any period for which a payment is made or due
under this Plan or under a plan maintained solely for the purpose of
complying with workers' compensation or unemployment
compensation or disability insurance laws, or solely to reimburse
the person for medical or medically related expenses. A person
shall be deemed to be "directly or indirectly paid, or entitled to
payment" by the Employer or any Related Employer regardless of
whether such payment is 1) made by or due from the Employer or
Related Employer directly, or 2) made indirectly through a trust
fund, insurer or other entity to which the Employer or Related
Employer contributes or pays premiums;
(3) Back pay: each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation
of damages, is either awarded or agreed to by the Employer or any
Related Employer. However, Hours of Service credited under
Subsection G(1) or (2) shall not be duplicated under this Subsection
G(3). Periods for which back pay is awarded or agreed to which
§ 58-59 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-59
1:170
§ 58-60. Accounting.
correspond to periods described in Subsection G(2) shall be subject
to the same 501 hour restriction for single continuous periods
which applies under Subsection G(2). These hours will be credited
to the employee for the computation period or periods to which the
award or agreement pertains rather than the computation period
in which the award, agreement, or payment is made.
(4) Military time:
(a) Each hour for which the person normally would have received
credit but for the fact that the person was performing service
in the uniformed services of the United States, provided that:
[1] Such service immediately follows service with the
Employer or any Related Employer as a Qualified
Employee; and
[2] The person returns to employment with the Employer or
any Related Employer at a time when the Employer or any
Related Employer is legally obligated to reemploy the
person under the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38 U.S.C. § 4301 et
seq., and any amendments, supplements, or successor
legislation.
(b) Credit under this Subsection G(4) shall be granted upon the
person's return to employment with the Employer or Related
Employer, but shall be applied to the Computation Periods in
which the person would have received credit under Subsection
G(1) or (2) but for the performance of uniformed service.
A. Accounts.
(1) Paper accounts of participants. The Administrator shall create and
maintain adequate records to disclose the interest in the Trust
Fund of each Participant who was a Qualified Employee at any time
on or after the Effective Date and for each Beneficiary of such a
Participant. Such records shall be in the form of individual
accounts, created and closed as appropriate. Credits and charges
shall be made to such accounts in the manner described in this
Plan. Each such Participant and Beneficiary shall have an Employer
Contribution Account to hold employer contributions to the Plan for
the Participant, and the earnings thereon.
(2) Paper accounts of plan. The Administrator shall create and
maintain adequate records to disclose the portions of the Trust
Fund which represent amounts not currently allocated to the
accounts of persons with an interest in the Plan. There shall be
three such accounts created with respect to each particular
§ 58-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-60
1:171
Employer which maintains this Plan (unless there would be zero
balances in any such account):
(a) Forfeiture account (to hold amounts forfeited from the
accounts of Inactive Participants plus any earnings).
(b) Early employer contributions account (to hold amounts
contributed to the Plan for a Plan Year before the end of that
Plan Year; see § 58-61D(1).
(3) Alternate payee accounts. Alternate Payee Accounts under this
Plan and Trust shall be created at such times as provided in
§ 58-70D(3) (relating to Alternate Payee Accounts under Qualified
Domestic Relations Orders).
(4) Segregation of assets.
(a) Paper accounts. The accounts described in Subsection A(1)
through (3) together account for all of the assets of the Trust
Fund. The maintenance of these individual accounts is for
accounting purposes only. A segregation of the assets of the
Trust Fund to each account shall not be required.
(b) Segregated accounts. The Trustees may segregate the assets
of the Trust Fund if they so desire. If the Trustees earmark any
assets to the accounts of specific Participants, they shall first
obtain the consent of the Participant or shall earmark such
assets ratably among the accounts of all Participants.
(c) Recordkeeping. Whenever assets are segregated, the Trustees
shall maintain adequate records to disclose which of the
accounts described in Subsection A(1) through (3) (or portions
of such accounts) are identified with which segregated group
of assets.
B. Income of trust fund.
(1) Definition. For the purposes of this Subsection, the "Income" of the
Trust Fund or any group of assets shall mean the net gain or loss of
the Trust Fund or group of assets from investments, as reflected by
interest payments, dividends, realized and unrealized gains and
losses on securities and other property, and administrative and
other expenses paid from the Trust Fund or the group of assets. All
administrative and other expenses which are fairly chargeable to
one or more segregated groups of assets shall be charged to those
assets alone, regardless of the fund from which those expenses
were initially paid. All administrative and other expenses which are
fairly chargeable to all of the assets of the Trust Fund shall be
charged pro rata against all of the segregated groups of assets,
regardless of the fund from which those expenses were initially
paid.
§ 58-60 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-60
1:172
(2) Annual determination. The Trustees shall determine the Income of
the Trust Fund since the most recent determination as of each
Accounting Date.
(3) Special determination. If a distribution of benefits is to begin from
the general Trust Fund during a given month, the Trustees shall
determine the Income of the Trust Fund since the most recent
determination as of the end of the month immediately preceding
the calendar month of the distribution.
(4) Termination of trust. The Trustees shall determine the Income of
the Trust Fund since the most recent determination upon the
Termination of the Trust and liquidation of its assets.
(5) Valuation of assets upon segregation. The Trustees shall determine
the Income of a group of assets at any time they choose to
segregate certain assets from the larger group.
(6) Return of segregated assets to general pool of investments.
Whenever any segregated group of assets is to be merged with
another group of assets, the Trustees shall determine the Income of
the two groups of assets in the Trust Fund since their most recent
valuation.
(7) Distribution from segregated group of assets. The Trustees shall
determine the Income of a segregated group of assets whenever
they are to make a distribution from such segregated group of
assets.
(8) Other determination. The Trustees may determine the Income of
the Trust Fund or any segregated portion of it since its most recent
valuation at any time they think it prudent to do so (e.g., the
Trustees may decide to determine the Income for certain
segregated bank accounts, mutual funds, or other assets quarterly,
monthly, or even daily); provided that elections to make such
determinations are not made in a fashion likely to discriminate
among persons with an interest in the Plan.
C. Allocation of income.
(1) In general. Except as provided in Subsection C(2), the Income of
each segregated portion of the Trust Fund shall be allocated to the
accounts described in Subsection A(1) through (3) as of the day
such Income is determined, but only to those accounts which have
a positive balance on such day and which have been assigned to
that segregated portion of the Trust Fund. If more than one of those
accounts have been assigned to that segregated portion of the
Trust Fund, the Income will be allocated among the accounts
according to each account's portion of the following total:
§ 58-60 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-60
1:173
§ 58-61. Additions to employer contribution accounts.
(a) The balances in the accounts as of the last asset valuation date
(to the extent the accounts are assigned to that segregated
portion of the Trust Fund); less
(b) The amount of any distributions or transfers from the accounts
during the period concerned (to the extent the segregated
portion of the Trust Fund is used to make such distributions or
transfers) multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the
number of days in the period after the date of distribution or
transfer and whose denominator is the total number of days in
the period; plus
(c) The amount of any contributions or transfers to the accounts
during the period concerned (to the extent the contributions or
transfers are assigned to the segregated portion of the Trust
Fund) multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the number
of days in the period after the date as of which the
contributions or transfers were credited to the accounts and
whose denominator is the total number of days in the period.
(2) Early employer contributions account. Any positive net Income
which is allocated under Subsection C(1) to the Early Employer
Contributions Account during a Plan Year shall be allocated as of
the last day of the Plan Year among the Employer Contribution
Accounts of the Qualified Recipients for that Plan Year by
increasing the percentage in effect under § 58-61A (relating to
Additions to Employer Contribution Accounts — Annual Allocation)
as described in that Subsection. All of such Income must be used to
provide additional credits for Qualified Recipients beyond those
which would have been received in the absence of such Income.
D. Valuation of assets. In determining the value of Trust Fund assets for
any purpose under this Plan, assets shall be valued on the basis of their
fair market value as of the valuation date.
E. Beneficiaries. Accounts originally maintained on behalf of a deceased
Participant shall be maintained on behalf of his current Beneficiaries
(see § 58-67).
A. Annual allocation.
(1) In general. Subject to the provisions of § 58-63 (relating to
Maximum Additions), Subsection D(2) (relating to Uniformed
Service), and subject to modification under Subsection A(2), as of
the last day of each Plan Year, the Employer Contribution Account
of each Qualified Recipient (see Subsection B) shall be credited
with an amount equal to 6% of the Qualified Recipient's
Compensation attributable to service as a Qualified Employee (or
service in the uniformed services of the United States recognized
§ 58-60 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-61
1:174
under this Plan due to service as a Qualified Employee) for the
portion of the Plan Year during which he/she was an Active
Participant.
(2) Increase. The percentage under Subsection A(1) shall be increased
for any given Plan Year if and to the extent necessary so that the
total amount of credits provided for that Plan Year under this
subsection and Subsection D(2) (relating to Payment of Employer
Contributions — Uniformed Service), as modified by § 58-63
(relating to Maximum Additions) is not less than the sum of:
(a) The greater of:
[1] The total amount which would be credited for all Qualified
Recipients for that Plan Year under Subsection A(1) prior
to the application of this Subsection A(2), plus the amount
of credits during that Plan Year under Subsection D(2)
(relating to Uniformed Service); or
[2] The maximum amount of withdrawals able to be made for
that Plan Year from the Forfeiture Account under
Subsection C (relating to Funding of Credits); plus
(b) Any Income to be allocated to the Employer Contribution
Accounts of Qualified Recipients for the Plan Year under
§ 58-60C(2) (relating to Early Employer Contributions
Account); and
(c) Any amount to be allocated to the Employer Contribution
Accounts of Qualified Recipients for the Plan Year under
Subsection D(4)(b)[1] (relating to contributions of state aid in
excess of the amount required).
B. Qualified recipients. For purposes of this section, a "Qualified
Recipient" for any Plan Year shall mean:
(1) A person who is an Active Participant on the last day of the Plan
Year; or
(2) A person who Separated from Service during the Plan Year:
(a) After having attained age 62;
(b) As a result of a condition which rendered him/her unable to
perform all of the essential functions of his/her employment
with or without reasonable accommodation, provided that such
condition was not caused by:
[1] Chronic or excessive use of intoxicants, drugs, or
narcotics;
[2] Intentionally self-inflicted injury or intentionally selfinduced
sickness; or
§ 58-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-61
1:175
[3] An unlawful act or enterprise on the part of the individual;
or
(c) As a result of his death; and
(3) Who was an Active Participant on the date of the Separation from
Service.
C. Funding of credits; employer contributions. The credits described in
Subsections A and D(2) shall be funded:
(1) First, by withdrawals from the Forfeiture Account (including
amounts forfeited on the last day of the Plan Year); and
(2) Then, if necessary, by contributions to the Plan and Trust Fund
from the Employer, which the Employer hereby covenants and
agrees to make, which may be from funds of the Employer and/or
grants from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and/or others.
D. Payment of employer contributions.
(1) In general. Employer contributions under this article for a given
plan year are due to be paid to the Trustees as soon as
administratively possible following the end of the plan year, but in
no event later than December 31 of the following plan year. All
amounts contributed before the end of the plan year shall be held
unallocated in a separate early employer contributions account
until the end of the plan year, when they shall be withdrawn and
allocated as if they were contributed on the last day of the plan
year. [Amended 4-6-2016 by Ord. No. 1008]
(2) Uniformed service. Employer contributions under this section for a
Participant with respect to any period of service in the uniformed
services of the United States shall be made at the later of: 1) the
time set forth in Subsection D(1); or 2) within a reasonable period
of time after the Participant returns to employment with the
Employer or any Related Employer, provided that the Participant
returns to employment at a time when the Employer or any Related
Employer is legally obligated to reemploy the person under the
Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of
1994, 38 U.S.C. § 4301 et seq., and any amendments, supplements,
or successor legislation. The amount of such contributions shall not
be adjusted for any earnings or forfeitures which may otherwise
have accrued to the benefit of the Participant during the period
between the time when the contributions would have been made
had the Participant not provided service in the uniformed services
of the United States, and the time when the contributions were
actually made.
(3) Additional contributions for interest on late contributions. If any
amount of Employer contributions for a Plan Year remains unpaid
as of December 31 of that Plan Year, the amount of Employer
§ 58-61 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-61
1:176
contributions for that Plan Year shall be increased by interest on
the unpaid amount as of December 31, from January 1 of the Plan
Year until the date of payment at a rate equal to the interest
assumption used for the required actuarial valuation report under
the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act,
53 P.S. § 895.101 et seq., or the discount rate applicable to treasury
bills issued by the Treasury Department of the United States with
a six-month maturity as of the last business day in December of
the Plan Year, whichever is greater, expressed as a monthly rate
and compounded monthly. Such "interest" contributions shall be
treated as Income of the Plan for the period after the end of the
Plan Year.
(4) Mistake of fact. The actual required Employer contributions for a
given Plan Year cannot be known until the end of the Plan Year,
since an employee's qualification for a contribution and the amount
of his/her Compensation for the Plan Year cannot be determined
until that time. Consequently, the estimates made by the Employer
in determining the minimum municipal obligation for the Plan Year
and in making contributions to the Plan during the Plan Year most
likely will be either higher or lower than the actual required
contributions; therefore:
(a) If the amount in the Early Employer Contributions Account as
of the last day of the Plan Year is insufficient to cover the
required allocations to Participants under Subsection A
(subject to modifications under § 58-63, relating to Maximum
Additions), the Employer must contribute the amount of the
shortfall to the Plan as soon as possible, together with interest
as described in Subsection D(3).
(b) If there otherwise would remain a positive balance in the Early
Employer Contributions Account as of the last day of the Plan
Year after making the required allocations to Participants
under Subsection A [subject to modifications under § 58-63,
relating to Maximum Additions, and after any Income earned
by the Early Employer Contributions Account for the Plan Year
is allocated to other accounts as described in §§ 58-60C(2) and
58-61A(2)(b), then:
[1] That portion of the Early Employer Contributions Account
as of the last day of the Plan Year which otherwise would
remain and which is attributable to grants by the
Commonwealth under the General Municipal Pension
System State Aid Program shall be transferred to the
South Whitehall Township Office Personnel Pension Plan
and Trust, together with the Income earned on that
amount from the last day of the Plan Year until the date of
the transfer, except that if such portion does not exceed
$500, then such portion shall instead be allocated as of the
last day of the Plan Year among the Employer Contribution
§ 58-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-61
1:177
§ 58-62. Employee contributions.
§ 58-63. Maximum additions.
Accounts of the Qualified Recipients for that Plan Year by
increasing the percentage in effect under Subsection A
(relating to Additions to Employer Contribution Accounts
— Annual Allocation) as described in that subsection.
[2] That portion of the Early Employer Contributions Account
which is not attributable to grants by the Commonwealth
under the General Municipal Pension System State Aid
Program shall either be:
[a] Returned to the Employer (if so directed by the
Administrator within one year after the date the
contributions were made to the Plan); or
[b] Treated as a new Employer contribution for the
following Plan Year, and retained in the Early
Employer Contributions Account.
(c) For purposes of this Plan, Employer contributions to the Early
Employer Contributions Account shall be deemed to be
attributable to grants under the General Municipal Pension
System State Aid Program to the extent the governing body of
the Employer allocates the grants to this Plan, and all amounts
allocated to Participant accounts under Subsection A and D(2)
from the Early Employer Contributions Account shall be
deemed to be attributable to grants under the General
Municipal Pension System State Aid Program until the amount
of such grants allocated to this Plan has been exhausted.
E. Multiple employers. For any Plan Year in which more than one employer
is included within the definition of "Employer," the following rules shall
apply:
(1) Employer contributions. Employer contributions to be allocated to
the account of a given Participant shall be made by his particular
employer.
(2) Forfeitures. For the purpose of allocating forfeitures, amounts
derived from the contributions of a particular employer shall be
allocated only to employees of that particular employer. Separate
subaccounts shall be maintained in the Forfeiture Account for this
purpose.
A. No contributions. No employee contributions shall be required or
permitted under this Plan.
§ 58-61 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-63
1:178
A. General definitions. When used in this section, the words and phrases
defined in this subsection shall have the following meanings, unless the
context in which they are used clearly indicates a different meaning:
COMPENSATION — The term "Compensation" for a Participant for a
Limitation Year shall mean:
In general. All wages within the meaning of Code § 3401(a) (for
purposes of income tax withholding at the source), and all other
payments of compensation to an employee by the Employer (in
the course of such employer's trade or business) for which the
Employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement
under Code §§ 6401(d), 6051(a)(3), and 6052, plus amounts that
would be included in wages but for an election under Code
§§ 125(a), 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b).
Compensation shall be determined without regard to any rules
under Code § 3401(a) that limit covered employment based on the
nature or location of the employment or the services performed
[such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code § 3401(a)(2)].

Payment during limitation year. Except as otherwise provided in
this definition, in order to be taken into account for a Limitation
Year, amounts under Subsection (1) of this definition must be
actually paid or made available to the Participant (or, if earlier,
includible in the gross income of the Participant) within the
Limitation Year. For this purpose, an amount is treated as paid on a
date if it is actually paid on that date or it would have been paid on
that date but for an election under Code §§ 125, 132(f)(4), 401(k),
403(b), 408(k), 408(p)(2)(A)(i), or 457(b).
(2)
Payment prior to severance from employment. Except as otherwise
provided in Subsections (4) and (5) of this definition, in order to be
taken into account for a Limitation Year, amounts under Subsection
(1) must be paid or treated as paid to the Participant [in accordance
with the rules of Subsection (2)] prior to the Participant's
severance from employment [within the meaning of Treas. Regs.
§ 1.415(a)-1(f)(5)] with the Employer. Thus, for example,
"Compensation" generally does not include severance pay or
parachute payments.
(3)
Regular pay after severance from employment. Notwithstanding
Subsection (3) of this definition, a payment of an amount described
in Subsection (1) after severance from employment will be
considered "Compensation" for the Limitation Year which includes
the date of severance from employment if it:
Is regular compensation for services during the Participant's
regular working hours, or compensation for services outside
the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or
shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar
payments;
(a)
(4)
§ 58-63 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-63
1:179
Would have been paid to the Participant prior to a severance
from employment if the Participant had continued in
employment with the Employer; and
(b)
Is paid by the later of 2.5 months after severance from
employment with the Employer maintaining the plan or the end
of the Limitation Year which includes the date of severance
from employment.
(c)
Leave cashouts. Notwithstanding Subsection (3) of this definition, a
payment of an amount described in Subsection (1) after severance
from employment will be considered "Compensation" for the
Limitation Year which includes the date of severance from
employment if it:
Is payment for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation, or
other leave, but only if the Participant would have been able to
use the leave if employment had continued; and
(a)
Is paid by the later of 2.5 months after severance from
employment with the Employer maintaining the plan or the end
of the Limitation Year which includes the date of severance
from employment.
(b)
(5)
Qualified military service. For purposes of this definition, a
Participant who is in qualified military service [within the meaning
of Code § 414(u)(5)] shall be treated as receiving Compensation
from the Employer during such period of qualified military service
equal to:
The Compensation the Participant would have received during
such period if the Participant were not in qualified military
service, determined based on the rate of pay the Participant
would have received from the Employer but for absence during
the period of qualified military service; or
(a)
If the compensation the Participant would have received
during such period was not reasonably certain, the
Participant's average Compensation from the Employer during
the twelve-month period immediately preceding the qualified
military service (or, if shorter, the period of employment
immediately preceding the qualified military service).
(b)
(6)
Back pay. Payments awarded by an administrative agency or court
or pursuant to a bona fide agreement by an employer to
compensate an employee for lost wages are Compensation within
the meaning of this definition for the Limitation Year to which the
back pay relates, but only to the extent such payments represent
wages and compensation that would otherwise be included in
compensation under this definition.
(7)
(8) Maximum amount which may be treated as compensation.
§ 58-63 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-63
1:180
EMPLOYER — The Sponsor and all Related Employers, and, to the
extent required under Treas. Regs. § 1.415(f)-1, a predecessor
employer within the meaning of that regulation.
LIMITATION YEAR — For this Plan, those periods which are
coextensive with the Plan Year after the Effective Date of this Plan.
Limitation Years for other plans shall be as elected for those plans.
General rule. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
definition, the "Compensation" of a Participant for any
Limitation Year shall not exceed the amount in effect for such
year under Code § 401(a)(17), as adjusted for changes in the
cost of living. (For any Limitation Year beginning in 2015, the
amount is $265,000.)
(a)
Short years. If Compensation is ever required to be determined
for a short Limitation Year which contains fewer than 12
months, the amount in effect for such Limitation Year under
Code § 401(a)(17) shall be equal to the amount in effect under
Code § 401(a)(17) for the calendar year in which the Limitation
Year begins, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is equal
to the number of months in the period, and whose denominator
is equal to 12.
(b)
B. Definitions relating to defined contribution limitations. When used in
this section, the words and phrases defined in this subsection shall have
the following meanings, unless the context in which they are used
clearly indicates a different meaning:
ANNUAL ADDITIONS — The term "Annual Additions," for a Participant
in any given Limitation Year with respect to the Defined Contribution
Plans maintained by the Employer, shall have the meaning given to
the term under Treas. Regs. § 1.415(c)-1(b) (which generally includes
all employer contributions, employee contributions, and forfeitures
credited to the Participant's accounts for the Limitation Year).
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN — Shall have the meaning provided
in Treas. Regs. § 1.415(c)-1(a)(2) (including mandatory employee
contributions to a defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer
which are not treated as employer pickup contributions under Code
§ 414(h)(2), and employee contributions to a separate account in a
defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer to the extent that
benefits are based on the separate account).
MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE AMOUNT —
"Maximum Permissible Amount," for any Limitation Year, shall
mean the lesser of — employee stock ownership plans under Treas.
Regs. § 1.415(c)-1(e) and (f), the term "Maximum Permissible
Amount," for any Limitation Year, shall mean the lesser of —
The defined contribution dollar limitation in effect for the
Limitation Year under Code § 415(c)(1)(A) as adjusted under
(a)
(1)
§ 58-63 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-63
1:181
Code § 415(d) for changes in the cost of living ($53,000 for
2015); or
One hundred percent of the Participant's Compensation for the
Limitation Year.
(b)
Short year.
If a short Limitation Year is created because of an amendment
changing the Limitation Year to a different twelve-consecutivemonth
period, for purposes of the short Limitation Year, the
number in Subsection (1)(a) of this definition shall be
multiplied by the following fraction:
number of months in the short Limitation Year
(including fractional parts of a month)
12
(a)
If the Plan is terminated as of a date other than the last day of
the Limitation Year, the Plan is deemed to have been amended
to change its Limitation Year, and the Maximum Permissible
Amount shall be determined by prorating for the resulting
short Limitation Year.
(b)
(2)
C. General rule. The amount of Annual Additions which would otherwise
be allocated under this Plan on behalf of any Participant during any
Limitation Year (whether of this Plan or any other plan of the Employer)
shall be reduced (under the procedures of Subsection D) to the extent
necessary and possible so that the total amount of Annual Additions
which may be allocated on behalf of any Participant during that
Limitation Year (whether of this Plan or any other plan of the Employer)
under all of the Defined Contributions Plans maintained by the
Employer shall not exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount.
D. Procedure for reducing contributions.
(1) Timing of reductions. Reductions pursuant to this section in the
amount of contributions and allocations made on behalf of a
Participant shall be made as soon as is administratively feasible,
preferably before contributions and allocations are made.
(2) Priority vs. medical plans. Annual Additions under this Plan shall be
reduced in full before Annual Additions are reduced under any
individual medical accounts (as defined in Code § 415(l)(2)) or postretirement
medical accounts for key employees (as described in
Code § 419A(d)) maintained by the Employer.
(3) Priority vs. earlier defined contribution plan allocations. Annual
Additions under this Plan which are allocated as of later dates shall
be reduced in full before any earlier allocations under this or any
other defined contribution plan of the Employer are reduced.
§ 58-63 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-63
1:182
(4) Priority vs. contemporaneous allocations under all defined
contribution plans. Annual Additions under this Plan which are
allocated on the same day as other Annual Additions under this
Plan or under other Defined Contribution Plans shall be reduced
according to the order of priority which follows (to the extent
necessary). Where a full reduction is not necessary under any given
category, the amount of Annual Additions to be reduced under this
Plan shall be determined by the following product:
The total amount of
Annual Additions to
be
reduced in that
category
X
The amount of Annual
Additions allocated under
this Plan in that category
The total amount of Annual
Additions allocated under
all
defined contribution plans
in that category
(a) Nondeductible employee contributions. First, nondeductible
employee contributions under this Plan and other Defined
Contribution Plans of the Employer shall be reduced.
(b) Elective deferrals. Second, elective deferrals under any other
plans of the Employer shall be reduced.
(c) Profit sharing employer contributions. Third, allocations which
would be attributable to nonelective employer contributions
under profit sharing plans of the Employer shall be reduced.
These reductions shall be used to increase the amount of
additions to be allocated to Participants who have not reached
their Code § 415 limit (as provided in this § 58-63). After each
such allocation, the provisions of this § 58-63 and similar Code
§ 415 provisions in other plans executed to that point shall be
re-executed in accordance with the new allocations.
Successive reductions and reallocations under this subsection
shall continue until all employer contributions are allocated to
Participants consistent with the Code § 415 limitations or all
eligible Participants have received the maximum amount
permitted under this § 58-63 and similar Code § 415 provisions
in other plans. Thereafter, the contributions from the Employer
shall be reduced.
(d) Money purchase employer contributions. Fourth, allocations
which would be attributable to nonelective employer
contributions under this and other money purchase pension
plans of the Employer shall be reduced.

§ 58-65. Vesting and forfeitures.
(e) Other allocations. Fifth, any allocations not described in
Subsection D(4)(a) through (d), or in Subsection D(5), shall be
reduced.
(f) Forfeitures. Finally, allocations which would be attributable to
withdrawals from forfeiture accounts of all Defined
Contribution Plans of the Employer shall be reduced.
(5) Matching contributions. Allocations which would be attributable to
employer matching contributions made with respect to employee
contributions or elective deferrals under Defined Contribution
Plans of the Employer that are reduced by virtue of this § 58-63
shall not be made and the Employer shall not be required to make
such contributions (since there are no underlying contributions to
match).
E. Conformance to Code § 415. The limitations provided by this section are
intended to comply with Code § 415 and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. To the extent there is any discrepancy between this section
and Code § 415 and related regulations, or any ambiguity in the terms
of this section, the discrepancy or ambiguity (whether this section is
more or less stringent than Code § 415 and related regulations) shall be
resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of Code
§ 415 and regulations promulgated thereunder.
A. Rollovers. No person may roll over any money or property to the Plan
and Trust Fund which was received from other qualified plans,
individual retirement accounts/annuities, Code § 403(a) or § 403(b)
annuities, Code § 457 eligible deferred compensation plans, or any
other plan, account, annuity, or arrangement (whether received directly

(4) Plan termination. The balance in all the Plan accounts of any
Participant or Beneficiary shall become 100% vested upon the
termination or complete discontinuance of Employer contributions
under this Plan and Trust. In the event of a partial termination of
the Plan, the accounts of those Participants (and Beneficiaries)
included in that part of the Plan which has terminated shall become
100% vested.
B. Forfeiture of nonvested employer contributions.
(1) Cash-out of plan benefits. In the case of any Participant who is not
100% vested in all of his Plan accounts (see Subsection A), the
nonvested portion of the Participant's Plan accounts shall be
forfeited:
(a) On any date, after the Participant Separates from Service, that
all of the Participant's remaining vested Plan benefits are paid
from the Plan; or
(b) On the date the Participant Separates from Service, if he/she
has no vested balance in any account under the Plan.
(2) (Reserved)
C. Application of forfeitures. All funds forfeited under Subsection B shall
be allocated to the Forfeiture Account. Amounts in the Forfeiture
Account under this Plan shall be applied on the last day of each Plan

before he incurs a Lengthy Break in Service [see § 58-59E(2)], then
the Employer shall contribute to the account(s) from which the
forfeiture was made an amount equal to the amount which was
forfeited from such account (without any adjustment for imputed
interest or imputed Plan Income or loss). The contributions
specified in this Subsection D(1) shall take place as of the date the
person becomes a Qualified Employee again.
(2) No limitations. The Employer contributions under this Subsection
D shall not be subject to any limitations provided in § 58-61
(relating to Employer contributions) or § 58-63 (relating to
Maximum Additions), and shall not be treated as Employer
contributions for those purposes.

permitted by the Qualified Domestic Relations Order) may designate
any person or persons (natural or legal) as his/her Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries to whom his/her Plan benefits are to be paid if he/she dies
before receipt of all such benefits. Beneficiaries may be designated
primarily, contingently, jointly, or successively.
B. Procedure. Beneficiary designations shall be made on a form prescribed
by the Administrator and will only be effective if filed with the
Administrator during the Participant's or Alternate Payee's lifetime.
C. Revocation. Each effective beneficiary designation filed with the
Administrator by a Participant or Alternate Payee will revoke all
previously filed designations by such person. The revocation of a
beneficiary designation shall not require the consent of any designated
beneficiary or the Participant's spouse.
D. Default beneficiaries. If a Participant (or Alternate Payee whose
Beneficiary is entitled to receive Plan benefits) fails to designate a
Beneficiary in the manner provided in Subsections A and B, or if all the
Beneficiaries designated by a deceased Participant or Alternate Payee
die before him/her or before a complete distribution of his/her benefits,

benefits.

contained in this § 58-68, no benefits shall be paid under this Plan to
any recipient until an administratively reasonable period of time after

distribution. To the extent possible, the notice shall be based on
statements supplied by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.

for alimony or other payments for support of a spouse, former
spouse, or any other relative or dependent of the Participant before

Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee under the terms of the Plan, except
§ 58-69 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-70

otherwise dispose of any right to benefits payable under this Plan
shall be void. The Trustees and the Employer shall not be liable
for or subject to, in any manner, the debts, contracts, liabilities,
engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits under this

(including approval of a property settlement agreement)
relating to the provision of payment by the Plan to an Alternate

Administrator shall promptly notify the affected Participant
and any Alternate Payee of:
[1] The receipt of such judgment, decree, or order; and
[2] The Administrator's procedure for determining whether or
not the judgment, decree, or order is a Qualified Domestic
Relations Order.

Accounts provided in Subsection D(3); and

(3) Alternate payee accounts.
(a) Creation. During any period in which the Administrator or a
court (or other tribunal) of competent jurisdiction is
determining whether a judgment, decree, or order is a
Qualified Domestic Relations Order, the Administrator shall
create separate accounts under this Plan ("Alternate Payee
accounts") and shall credit such accounts with the amounts, if
any, which would have been payable to each Alternate Payee
during such period (as they would have become due) if the
judgment, decree, or order had already been determined to be
a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. The amounts credited to
the Alternate Payee accounts shall be debited from the
accounts of the Participant potentially subject to the putative
Qualified Domestic Relations Order. The Alternate Payee
accounts need not be segregated from the general assets of the
Trust Fund; they only must be accounted for separately.
(b) Disposition.
[1] To alternate payee. If a judgment, decree, or order is
determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order
within 18 months after the date on which the first payment
would be required to be made under the judgment, decree,
or order, the Administrator shall direct the Trustees to pay
the amounts in Alternate Payee accounts created with
respect to such judgment, decree, or order to the Alternate
Payees.

§ 58-70 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-70
1:193
[iii] The termination, partial termination, or complete
discontinuance of Employer contributions to the
Plan and Trust.
[b] Such returned amounts shall be paid at such time and
in such manner as is otherwise provided in this Plan
(except that any amounts already due for distribution
shall be paid to the proper recipient immediately).
(4) Compliance with qualified domestic relations order. If a judgment,
decree, or order is conclusively determined to be a Qualified
Domestic Relations Order, the Administrator shall direct the
Trustees to provide benefits under the Plan in accordance with
such Qualified Domestic Relations Order.
E. Facility of payment. Whenever the Administrator determines that a
person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment is
under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable
to manage his financial affairs, the Administrator may direct the
Trustees to make payments to such person, to his legal representative,
to a relative, or to a friend of such person for his benefit. Any payment
of a benefit or installment in accordance with the provisions of this
section shall be a complete discharge from any liability for the making
of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.
F. Unclaimed distribution.
(1) Segregation. If, after diligent inquiry, the Administrator is unable to
locate a person for the purpose of distribution of benefits under this
Plan by the end of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which
the distribution was to have been made, the Administrator shall
direct the Trustees to segregate the person's unclaimed Plan
benefits in a separate interest-bearing account under the Plan.
Such separate account shall be entitled to all income it earns and
shall bear all expenses it incurs.
(2) Payment. If a person entitled to benefits segregated in an account
under Subsection F(1) files a claim for benefits under this Plan and
the Administrator approves such claim, the Administrator shall
direct the Trustees to pay the segregated amounts over to the
claimant.
(3) Escheat. Amounts which remain unclaimed in an account under
Subsection F(1) upon the termination and liquidation of this Plan
and Trust or, if earlier, at the time when such property shall escheat
under applicable state law (or be delivered to the state under
applicable abandoned and unclaimed property law), shall be
distributed to the state with jurisdiction over the amounts. In the
event of a distribution under this subsection, the Plan and Trust
shall have no further responsibility for such amounts.
§ 58-70 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-70
1:194
§ 58-71. Claims procedure.
G. Survivors of participant who dies while performing qualified military
service. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, the
survivors of any Participant who dies while performing qualified
military service are entitled to any additional benefits (other than
contributions relating to the period of qualified military service, but
including vesting service credit for such period and any ancillary life
insurance or other survivor benefits) that would have been provided
under the Plan had the Participant resumed employment on the day
preceding the Participant's death and then terminated employment on
account of death.
A. Filing a claim. A Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee shall make
a claim for benefits under this Plan by filing a written request with the
Administrator on a form supplied by the Administrator.
B. Notice of denial. If the Administrator denies a request for benefits
under Subsection A in whole or in part, it shall notify the claimant of the
same in writing within 60 days of the date the request was filed with the
Administrator. Any notice of denial shall contain:
(1) The reason for the denial;
(2) Specific references to the Plan provisions on which the denial is
based;
(3) A description of any additional information needed to perfect the
claim and an explanation of why such information is necessary; and

shall have the right:
(a) To a hearing within 60 days of the receipt of the notice of
denial under Subsection B;

(c) To review pertinent documents;
(d) To submit comments in writing within 60 days of the receipt of
the notice of denial under Subsection B; and

§ 58-72. Trust and investments.
(3) Decision. The Administrator shall issue a written decision at the
conclusion of a review under this section within 60 days following

under Subsection C(1). Such decision shall give specific reasons for
the decision and provide specific references to the plan provisions
on which it is based.
(4) Compliance with Local Agency Law. All reviews under this
Subsection C shall comply with the provisions of the Local Agency
Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 551 et seq.
A. Establishment and acceptance of trust. The Trustees shall receive all
contributions paid to them under this Plan in cash or other property
approved by the Administrator for acceptance by the Trustees. All
property so received, together with income on such property, shall be
held, managed, and administered in trust pursuant to the terms of this
Plan agreement, and shall constitute the Trust Fund under this Plan.
The Trustees shall be responsible only for such sums as shall actually be
received by them as Trustees. They shall have no duty to collect any
sums from the Employer or the Participants, and shall have no duties
and responsibilities other than those set forth in this Plan and Trust or
as imposed by applicable law. The Trustees may segregate invested
assets. However, notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the
Trustees may only earmark specific investments to the accounts of
specific persons if the persons consent or if the investments are
purchased ratably.
B. Trustees.
(1) Qualification. A Trustee under this Plan may be any individual or
corporation not prohibited from serving as a Trustee under
§ 58-75A.
(2) Initial trustees. The initial Trustees shall be the members of the
Committee described in § 58-74A(2), provided that no person shall
be a Trustee unless and until he/she signs a document accepting
the Trust and agreeing to perform the duties of a Trustee under
this Plan and Trust.
(3) Joint trustees. If at any time there is more than one Trustee, the
decision of the majority of the Trustees shall determine the actions
of the Trustees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator
may allocate responsibilities among the Trustees from time to time
by written notice to the Trustees. In such case, a Trustee (the "first
Trustee") shall not be liable, either individually or as a Trustee, for
any breaches of duty or losses to the Plan and Trust arising out of
the acts or omissions of a co-Trustee in connection with areas of
§ 58-71 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-72
1:196
responsibility allocated to the co-Trustee to the exclusion of the
first Trustee unless:
(a) The first Trustee participates knowingly in, or knowingly
undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of the co-Trustee,
including knowing such act or omission is a breach of duty;
(b) By the first Trustee's failure to comply with the standards set
forth in § 58-75C with respect to his own areas of
responsibility, the first Trustee enables the co-Trustee to
commit a breach of duty; or
(c) The first Trustee has knowledge of a breach of duty by the co-
Trustee and fails to make reasonable efforts under the
circumstances to remedy the breach.
(4) Resignation. Any Trustee may resign at any time upon 15 days'
notice in writing to the Board of Commissioners of the Sponsor and
the Administrator.
(5) Removal. The Board of Commissioners of the Sponsor may remove
one or more of the Trustees at any time upon 15 days' notice in
writing to the Trustees and the Administrator. In addition, unless
otherwise provided by Ordinance or Resolution of the Board of
Commissioners, a Trustee who is a member of the Committee
described in § 58-74A(2) shall automatically be removed from office
upon his resignation or removal from the Committee under
§ 58-74A(2) or upon the expiration of his term of office on that
Committee and the appointment of a successor.
(6) Successor and additional trustees. Upon the removal, resignation,
or death of a Trustee, the Board of Commissioners of the Sponsor
may appoint a successor Trustee provided that the Board must act
to insure that there will be at least one Trustee. In addition, at any
time the Board of Commissioners of the Sponsor may appoint one
or more additional Trustees. All Trustees appointed under this
subsection shall have the same powers and duties as those
conferred upon the initial Trustees under this Plan and Trust.
Unless otherwise provided by Ordinance or Resolution of the Board
of Commissioners and unless the Board of Commissioners has
appointed a corporate Trustee, all persons appointed to the
Committee under § 58-74A(2) shall automatically be appointed as
Trustees of this Trust as well, provided that no person shall be a
Trustee unless and until he/she signs a document accepting the
Trust and agreeing to perform the duties of a Trustee under this
Plan and Trust.
(7) Transfer of assets to new trustees. Upon the appointment of a
successor or additional Trustee under Subsection B(6), the former
body of Trustees (or their personal representatives) shall assign,
transfer, and pay over to the new or reconstituted body of Trustees
the funds and properties then constituting the Trust Fund.
§ 58-72 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-72
1:197
However, the former body of Trustees are authorized to reserve
such sum of money as may seem to them advisable for payment
of their fees and expenses in connection with the settlement of
their accounts; any balance of such reserve remaining after the
payment of such fees and expenses shall be paid over to the new or
reconstituted body of Trustees as soon as possible.
C. Investment of trust fund.
(1) In general. Except as provided in this section and Subsections E
(relating to Participant-directed investments), F (relating to
Investment Managers), and H (relating to limiting directions from
the Administrator), the Trustees shall have the power to invest and
reinvest at any time all money or other property of any description
held by them and constituting part of the Trust Fund. They may
make such investments in any manner they deem advisable
(subject to the duty of care required under § 58-75C and the other
fiduciary requirements of § 58-75) which are permitted by law, and
will not be limited to investments which are lawful for trustees.
However, in making investments, the Trustees shall keep in mind
the need for a certain degree of liquidity in order to provide
benefits under this Plan.
(2) Location. The Trustees may not maintain the indicia of ownership
of any assets of the Plan and Trust outside the jurisdiction of the
United States District Courts.
(3) Employer securities. The Trustees shall not invest in any securities
of the Employer or any Related Employer.
D. Life insurance policies and annuity contracts.

policies on the lives of Participants, and may only invest in annuity
contracts on the lives of Participants which are retirement annuity
policies, retirement income endowment policies, disability income
policies, a combination of such policies, or other annuity contracts
permitted under Pennsylvania law and approved by the
Department of the Auditor General for inclusion in municipal
pension plans eligible for general municipal pension system state
aid.
(2) Requirements for permitted contracts. The Trustee may apply for
permitted annuity contracts on any day of any month, and may
continue to hold contracts on the lives of Inactive Participants
which were purchased earlier. Each contract shall provide that the
Trustees shall be the owner of such contract while it is held under
this Trust, and that it may be cash surrendered or exchanged for
another policy before the annuitant attains the Normal Retirement
Age (at least). All rights, options, and privileges which are available
by the terms of such contracts shall be vested exclusively in or
exercised solely by the Trustees. In the event of any conflict
§ 58-72 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-72
1:198
between the terms of this Plan and the terms of any insurance
contract purchased hereunder, the Plan provisions shall control.
E. Participant-directed investments. If the Administrator shall so allow,
Participants, Beneficiaries, and/or Alternate Payees may direct the
Trustees to invest all or a portion of the amounts allocated to their Plan
accounts, in particular investments in accordance with the provisions of
§ 58-73.
F. Investment by investment managers.
(1) In general. The Administrator may appoint one or more persons
qualified under Subsection F(2) to be Investment Managers under
this Plan, with powers to manage, acquire, and/or dispose of
specified assets in the Trust. Each such appointment shall specify
the powers granted to the Investment Manager, the assets
involved, and the duties and responsibilities, if any, of the Trustees
with respect to the assets subject to investment by the Investment
Manager. The Administrator shall have the authority and
responsibility for establishing operational and administrative
procedures to coordinate the activities of the Trustees and any
Investment Manager. The Trustees shall have no obligation to take
any action with respect to those assets of the Trust subject to the
direction of an Investment Manager without receipt of written
directions acceptable to the Trustees from the Investment
Manager, and the Trustees shall be under no duty to review such
directions. The Administrator may revoke an appointment under
this section or change its terms at any time. Upon receipt of a
written notice from the Administrator of the resignation or removal
of an Investment Manager, the Trustees shall assume management
responsibility for the assets previously appointed to the direction of
the Investment Manager. The Investment Manager may not invest
in any assets in which the Trustees are precluded from investing
under Subsections C (relating to Investment of the Trust Fund) or D
(relating to Life Insurance Policies and Annuity Contracts).
(2) Qualification. An Investment Manager must be either:
(a) Registered as an investment adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940;
(b) A bank (as defined in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940); or
(c) An insurance company qualified to perform the duties of an
Investment Manager under the laws of more than one state.
(3) Acceptance and communication. A person appointed under
Subsection F(1) shall not exercise the powers of an Investment
Manager until he has acknowledged in writing that he is a
Fiduciary under this Plan and until the appointment and
acknowledgment have been transmitted to the Administrator and
the Trustees.
§ 58-72 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-72
1:199
(4) Security transactions. If an Investment Manager appointed
pursuant to this section elects to place security transactions
directly with a broker or dealer, the Trustees shall not recognize
such transactions unless and until the Trustees have received
instructions or confirmations from the Investment Manager in such
manner of communication customary to the Trustees. Should the
Investment Manager direct the Trustees to utilize the services of
any person with regard to the assets under its management or
control, such instructions shall specifically set forth the actions to
be taken by the Trustees as to such services. In the event that an
Investment Manager places security transactions directly or
directs the utilization of services, the Investment Manager shall be
solely responsible for the acts of the persons utilized. The sole duty
of the Trustees as to such transactions shall be incident to the
Trustees' practices as a custodian.
(5) Release and indemnification of trustee. To the extent that the Trust
is subject to the direction of an Investment Manager:
(a) The Trustees shall not be responsible nor have any liability for
acting pursuant to any direction of the Investment Manager or
failing to act in the absence of any direction from the
Investment Manager (except as may otherwise be imposed by
applicable law), and shall not be required to consult with or
advise the Administrator or the Employer regarding the
investment quality of any investments; and
(b) The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Trustees harmless
from any and all losses or claims which arise with respect to
the Trust, unless the Trustees:
[1] Knowingly participate in or knowingly conceal an act or
omission of the Investment Manager, knowing such act to
be a breach of fiduciary duty;
[2] Have enabled the Investment Manager to commit a breach
by failing to discharge the Trustees' duties in accordance
with the fiduciary requirements of § 58-75 and applicable
law; or
[3] Have knowledge of a breach of fiduciary responsibility by
the Investment Manager and fail to make reasonable
efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach.
G. Other powers of trustees. Subject to the other provisions of this section
and the provisions of § 58-75 (relating to Fiduciaries), the Trustees shall
be entitled to exercise, in their own discretion, the following powers
regarding the administration of the Trust Fund:
(1) Purchase of property: to purchase, or subscribe for, any securities
or other property and to retain the same in trust, regardless of

investment for trust funds under applicable law;
(2) Disposition of property: to sell, exchange, convey, transfer,
mortgage, pledge, lease, grant options with respect to, or
otherwise dispose of any securities or other property held by the

changes affecting corporate securities, and to delegate
discretionary powers, and to pay any assessments or charges in
connection therewith; to manage, operate, improve, develop,

properties, royalties, or interests; and generally to exercise any of
the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, securities, or
other property held as part of the Trust Fund;
(4) Registration of and title to investments: to cause any securities or
other property held as part of the Trust Fund to be registered in the
name(s) of the Trustees or in the name(s) of one or more nominees
of the Trustees, or to hold any investments in bearer form, so long
as the books and records of the Trustees shall at all times show that
all such investments are part of the Trust Fund;
(5) Borrowing: to borrow or raise money for the purposes of the Trust
in such amount and upon such terms and conditions as the Trustees
shall deem advisable. For any sum so borrowed, the Trustees may
issue a promissory note as Trustees and secure repayment by
pledging all, or any part, of the Trust Fund. No person lending
money to the Trustees shall be bound to see to the application of
the money lent or to inquire into the validity, expediency, or
propriety of any such borrowing;
(6) Collection: to collect and receive any and all money and other
property of whatsoever kind or nature due or owing or belonging to
the Trust Fund and to give full discharge and acquittance therefor;

reasonable period, and continues reasonable interest;
(7) Retention of cash: to keep such portion of the Trust Fund in cash or

1:201
(8) Retention of property acquired: to accept and retain for such time

deliver any and all documents or transfer and conveyance and any
and all other instruments that may be necessary or appropriate to
carry out the powers granted under this Plan;

administrative proceedings; and to represent the Trust Fund in all
suits and legal and administrative proceedings;
(11) Employment of agents and counsel: subject to the prohibitions of
§ 58-75A, to employ suitable agents, counsel, consultants,
specialists, and accountants, any one of whom may also be so
engaged by the Employer; to pay their reasonable expenses and
compensation in the event the Employer has not so paid them; and
to rely exclusively upon, and be fully protected in any action taken
in good faith in relying upon, any opinions or reports which shall be
furnished by any such accountant, counsel, specialist, or other
consultant.
(12) Incorporation: to organize and incorporate under the laws of any
state (or participate in the organization or incorporation of) a
corporation for the purpose of acquiring and holding title to any
property which the Trustees are authorized to acquire for the Trust
Fund and to exercise with respect thereto any of the powers, rights,
and duties they have with respect to other assets of the Trust Fund;
(13) Pooling of assets: to transfer any of the assets of this Trust to any
pooled investment fund or group trust (including those which have
one or more trustees who are Trustees under this Trust) which has
been ruled by the Internal Revenue Service to be, and which is, a
qualified trust exempt from tax under the Code and which has been
established for the purpose of permitting separate qualified
pension and profit sharing trusts to pool some or all of their funds
for investment purposes and as to which it has been ruled by the
Internal Revenue Service that the pooling of funds by the separate
trusts will not adversely affect the qualified status of the separate
trusts. Any such common trust fund shall constitute an integral part
of this Plan and Trust. The commingling of assets of this Trust with
assets of other qualified participating trusts in such pooled funds is
specifically authorized;
(14) Legal actions: to prosecute, defend against, or participate in any
legal actions involving the Trust or any Trustee in the manner and
§ 58-72 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-72
1:202
to the extent the Trustees deem advisable. The Trustees need not
participate in any litigation concerning the Trust or the Trustees'
management of the Trust unless first indemnified against expense
by the Employer in a form satisfactory to the Trustee, unless the
litigation is occasioned by the negligence or fault of the Trustee
and the Trustee is found to be negligent or at fault pursuant to such
litigation; and
(15) Necessary acts. To do all such acts, take all such proceedings, and
exercise all such rights and privileges as the Trustees may deem
necessary to administer the Trust Fund and carry out the purposes
of this Plan and Trust, even though not specifically mentioned in
this document.
H. Limiting directions from Administrator. The Trustees shall comply with
any directions given by the Administrator under § 58-74C (relating to
limiting directions from the Administrator) as promptly as possible. The
Trustees shall not be responsible for any loss which may result from
compliance with the directions of the Administrator or the failure or
refusal of the Administrator to approve any actions which require the
Administrator's approval, and the Employer shall indemnify and hold
the Trustees harmless for any such loss.
I. Distributions from trust fund. From time to time, the Trustees shall
make payments out of the Trust Fund to such persons, in such manner,
for such purposes, and in such amounts as may be specified in written
directions by the Administrator. Such directions must be accompanied
by a certificate executed by the Administrator or its designate that the
payment is in accordance with this Plan. Once made, the amount of any
such payment shall no longer constitute a part of the Trust Fund. The
Trustees shall not be responsible in any way for the application of such
payments or for the adequacy of the Trust Fund to meet and discharge
any and all liabilities under the Plan.
J. Administrative payments.
(1) Compensation of trustees and investment managers. Trustees who
are also officers or employees of the Employer shall receive no
compensation for their services as Trustees under this Plan. All
other Trustees may be paid such reasonable compensation as shall
from time to time be agreed upon in writing by the Board of
Commissioners of the Sponsor and the Trustees. Investment
Managers shall be paid such fees as shall from time to time be
agreed upon in writing by the Investment Manager and the
Administrator. Trustee and Investment Manager fees may be paid
by the Employer, but unless or until so paid they shall constitute a
charge upon the Trust Fund.
(2) Expenses. The Trustees shall be reimbursed for any reasonable
expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred by them in
the administration of the Trust. Such reimbursement may be made
§ 58-72 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-72
1:203
by the Employer, but unless or until so paid it shall constitute a
charge upon the Trust Fund.
(3) Taxes. All taxes of any and all kinds whatsoever that may be levied
or assessed (under existing or future laws) upon or with respect to
the Trust Fund or the income of the Trust Fund shall be paid from
the Trust Fund.
K. Accounting.
(1) Recordkeeping. The Trustees shall keep accurate and detailed
accounts of all investments, receipts, disbursements, and other
transactions under this Trust. All accounts, books, and records
relating to such transactions shall be open to inspection and audit
at all reasonable times by any person designated by the
Administrator.
(2) Reports to administrator. Within 60 days following the close of each
fiscal year of the Trust, within 60 days following the effective date
of the termination of the Plan or Trust, and within 60 days after the
removal or resignation of a Trustee, the Trustees shall file with the
Administrator a written account of all investments, receipts,
disbursements, and other transactions affected by them during
such fiscal year (or during the period from the close of the last
fiscal year to the date on which the Trustee resigned or was
removed, or the effective date of the termination of the Plan or
Trust). Such account shall also set forth the current value of the
Trust Fund and its assets. Neither the Administrator nor any other
person shall be entitled to any further accounting by the Trustees,
except as provided by law.
(3) Discharge from liability. Thirty-one days after an accounting has
been filed under Subsection K(2), the Trustees shall be forever
released and discharged from all liability and accountability to
anyone with respect to the propriety of their actions and
transactions shown in the accounting, except with respect to any
actions or transactions as to which the Administrator has objected
in a writing filed with the Trustees before such time. If such an
objection is filed, the Trustees shall, unless the matter is
compromised with the Administrator, file its account in any court of
competent jurisdiction for audit and adjudication.
L. Immunity.
(1) Persons to whom responsible. No person other than the Employer
or the Administrator may require an accounting or bring an action
against the Trustees with respect to the Trust created under this
Plan or their actions as Trustees.
(2) Ordinary negligence. The Trustees shall not be liable for the
making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made
by them as provided under this Plan, nor for any loss to, or

§ 58-73. Participant-directed investments.
diminution of, the Trust Fund unless caused by their own gross
negligence, willful misconduct, or lack of good faith.
(3) Permitted reliance. The Trustees shall be fully protected in relying
upon:
(a) Action by administrator: a certification by the Administrator or
by any person designated by the Administrator [under
§ 58-74B(2)] with respect to any instruction or direction of the
Administrator. The Trustees may rely upon any such
designation until they have received a revocation of same;
(b) Other writings: any instrument, certificate, or paper believed
by them to be genuine and be signed or presented by the
proper person or persons; the Trustees shall be under no duty
to make any investigation or inquiry as to any statement
contained in any such writing, but may accept the writing as
conclusive evidence of the truth and accuracy of such
statements.
M. Purpose: exclusive benefit rule. Except as provided in § 58-61D(4)
(relating to disposition of contributions made on the basis of a mistake
of fact), all assets of the Trust Fund, including investment income, shall
be retained for the exclusive benefit of Participants, Alternate Payees,
and Beneficiaries, and shall be used to pay benefits to such persons or
to pay administrative expenses of the Plan and Trust Fund to the extent
not paid by the Employer; they shall not revert to or inure to the benefit
of the Employer. The Trustees shall exercise all powers and discharge
all duties under this Plan and Trust solely in the general interest of
Participants, Alternate Payees, and Beneficiaries.
N. Standard of care. The Trustees, all agents, counsel, consultants,
specialists, and accountants retained by them under Subsection G(11),
and all Investment Managers under Subsection F shall be subject to the
fiduciary requirements detailed in § 58-75.
A. Program authorized. If the Administrator shall so allow, Active
Participants (or all Participants) may direct the Trustees to invest all or
a portion of the amounts allocated to their Plan accounts in particular
investments in accordance with the provisions of this section. A
Participant may also direct the Trustees to resume responsibility for
any portion of such investments. Participant directions shall expire to
the extent that amounts which have been so directed are forfeited or
distributed, or are invested in investments which are no longer
permitted under the participant-directed investment program.
Investment directions by a Participant under this section shall relieve
the Administrator and the Trustees of all fiduciary responsibilities in
the management of such funds. If the Administrator shall so allow,
§ 58-72 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-73
1:205
Beneficiaries and Alternate Payees may be given the same rights under
this section as Participants.
B. Definitions. For purposes of this section:
AFFILIATE — Shall include:
AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN —
DESIGNATED INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVE — A specific investment
identified by a Plan Fiduciary as an available investment alternative
under the participant-directed investment program. An investment
alternative permitted under the participant-directed investment
program which is not specifically identified by a Plan Fiduciary, such
as an investment alternative covered by a general rule that allows
Any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with the person. For purposes of this Subsection
(1), the term "control" means, with respect to a person other than
an individual, the power to exercise a controlling influence over the
management or policies of such person;
(1)
Any officer, director, partner, employee, an employee of an affiliated
employer, relative [as defined in ERISA § 3(15)], brother, sister, or
spouse of a brother or sister, of the person; and
(2)
Any corporation or partnership of which the person is an officer,
director, or partner.
(3)
In general. The term "Average Annual Total Return" shall mean
the average annual compounded rate of return that would equate
an initial investment in a designated investment alternative to the
ending redeemable value of that investment calculated with the
before-tax methods of computation prescribed in Securities and
Exchange Commission Form N-1A, N-3, or N-4, as appropriate,
except that such method of computation may exclude any frontend,
deferred, or other sales loads that are waived for the
Participants of the covered individual account plan. Nothing in
this section requires disclosure of returns for periods before the
inception of a Designated Investment Alternative.
(1)
Transitional rule. For Plan Years beginning before October 1, 2021,
if the Administrator reasonably and in good faith determines that
it does not have the information on expenses attributable to the
Plan that is necessary to calculate, in accordance with Subsection
(1) of this definition, the five-year and ten-year Average Annual
Total Returns for a Designated Investment Alternative that is not
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
Administrator may use a reasonable estimate of such expenses
or the most recently reported Total Annual Operating Expenses
of the Designated Investment Alternative as a substitute for such
expenses, and shall inform Participants of the basis on which the
returns were determined.
(2)
§ 58-73 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-73
1:206
Participants to invest in any asset administratively feasible for the
Plan to hold and not otherwise prohibited under the program, is not
a "Designated Investment Alternative," and the information production
and other requirements applicable to Designated Investment
Alternatives shall not apply to such a nonspecified investment
alternative.
TOTAL ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES —
In the case of a Designated Investment Alternative that is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the annual
operating expenses and other asset-based charges before waivers
and reimbursements (e.g., investment management fees,
distribution fees, service fees, administrative expenses, separate
account expenses, mortality and expense risk fees) that reduce the
Designated Investment Alternative's rate of return, expressed as a
percentage, calculated in accordance with the required Securities
and Exchange Commission form, e.g., Form N-1A (open-end
management investment companies) or Form N-3 or N-4 (separate
accounts offering variable annuity contracts); or
(1)
In the case of a Designated Investment Alternative that is not
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the sum
of the fees and expenses described in the following subsections
before waivers and reimbursements, for the Designated Investment
Alternative's most recently completed fiscal year, expressed as a
percentage of the Designated Investment Alternative's average net
asset value for that year:
Management fees as described in the Securities and Exchange
Commission Form N-1A that reduce the Designated Investment
Alternative's rate of return;
(a)
Distribution and/or servicing fees as described in the
Securities and Exchange Commission Form N-1A that reduce
the Designated Investment Alternative's rate of return; and
(b)
Any other fees or expenses not included in Subsection (1) or
(2) of this definition that reduce the Designated Investment
Alternative's rate of return (e.g., externally negotiated fees,
custodial expenses, legal expenses, accounting expenses,
transfer agent expenses, recordkeeping fees, administrative
fees, separate account expenses, mortality and expense risk
fees), excluding brokerage costs described in Item 21 of
Securities and Exchange Commission Form N-1A.
(c)
(2)
C. Investment instructions.
(1) In general. The Trustees shall identify a specific fiduciary or agent
to receive investment instructions, and all investment instructions
must be made through such fiduciary or agent. All Participant
investment instructions shall be made on such written forms (or in
§ 58-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-73
1:207
accordance with such online procedures) as may be prescribed
by the Trustees or the identified fiduciary or agent. Instructions
may relate to amounts allocated to the Participant's accounts to
date and/or to amounts as they are so allocated in the future.
Each Participant who is qualified to participate in the participantdirected
investment program shall have an opportunity to obtain
written confirmation of such instructions.
(2) Restrictions and procedures.
(a) In general. The Trustees may promulgate nondiscriminatory
rules restricting Participant directions to such times,
investments, amounts, and features as may be necessary or
desirable to avoid undue administrative expenses or
complexity in the overall operation of the Participant-directed
investment program, provided that such rules comply with
requirements of this Subsection C(2) and of Subsection D. For
example, without limiting the foregoing, the Trustees may
restrict investment to identified specific investment
alternatives.
(b) Range of risk and return characteristics. The Trustees shall
permit a sufficient number and variety of investment
alternatives to provide Participants with a reasonable
opportunity to materially affect the potential return on
amounts in their accounts and the degree of risk to which such
amounts are subject.
(c) General frequency standard. The rules applicable to any given
investment alternative made available under the participantdirected
investment program must permit Participants to give
investment instructions with a frequency which is appropriate
in light of the market volatility to which the investment
alternative may reasonably be expected to be subject.
(d) Core investment funds. The rules applicable to each of the
investment alternatives included in the group of "core funds"
described in Subsection D must permit a Participant to give
instructions no less frequently than once within any threemonth
period.
(e) Investment alternative available to receive transfers. Under
the rules established by the Trustees, either:
[1] At least one of the "core funds" described in Subsection D
must permit a Participant to transfer into that fund as
frequently as Participants are permitted to give
investment instructions with respect to any investment
alternative included in the participant-directed investment
program which permits Participants to give investment
instructions more frequently than once within any threemonth
period; or
§ 58-73 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-73
1:208
[2] With respect to each investment alternative which permits
Participants to give investment instructions more
frequently than once within any three-month period,
Participants are permitted to direct their investments from
such investment alternative to a Liquid Investment as
frequently as they are permitted to give investment
instructions with respect to such investment alternative,
and, with respect to the Liquid Investment, Participants
are permitted to direct investments from the Liquid
Investment to at least one of the "core funds" described in
§ 58-72D as frequently as they are permitted to give
investment instructions with respect to that core fund. For
purposes of this Subsection C(2)(e)[2], a "Liquid
Investment" is an income-producing, low-risk, liquid fund,
subfund, or account.
(f) Employer securities. The participant-directed investment
program shall not permit a Participant to directly or indirectly
acquire any securities of the Employer or any Related
Employer or Affiliate.
(g) Annuity contracts. If the Trustees permit investment in annuity
contracts under the participant-directed investment program,
an Active Participant may only direct investment in annuity
contracts which are on his/her own life.
(3) Compliance with instructions. The fiduciary or agent receiving the
instructions shall be obligated to comply with such instructions,
unless an instruction, if implemented:
(a) Would not be permitted under this section or would otherwise
not be in accordance with the provisions of this Plan;
(b) Would not comply with the procedures, limitations, or
restrictions established by the Trustees for the participantdirected
investment program;
(c) Would cause a Fiduciary to maintain the indicia of ownership of
any assets of the Plan outside the jurisdiction of the district
courts of the United States other than as permitted under the
standards of ERISA § 404(b) and 29 CFR § 2550.404b-1;
(d) Would jeopardize the Plan's tax qualified status under the
Code;
(e) Could result in a loss in excess of a Participant's account
balance;
(f) Would result in a prohibited transaction described in § 58-75E;
(g) Would result in the acquisition of a "collectible," as that term is
defined in Code § 408(m) and the regulations thereunder;
§ 58-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-73
1:209
(h) Would generate income that would be taxable to the Plan;
(i) Would result in a direct or indirect:
[1] Sale, exchange, or lease of property between the Employer
or any Affiliate of the Employer and the Plan except for the
acquisition or disposition of any interest in a fund,
subfund, or portfolio managed by the Employer or any
Affiliate of the Employer;
[2] Loan to the Employer or any Affiliate of the Employer;
[3] Acquisition or sale of any employer real property [as
defined in ERISA § 407(d)(2)]; or
[4] Acquisition or sale of any employer security; or
(j) Would violate any applicable law, statute, regulation, rule,
order, or decree.
(4) Unavailable investments. In the event the Trustees find that an
investment meeting the requirements of this Trust cannot be
procured for a Participant under this section, or a given investment
is or becomes unavailable, the Trustees shall report the same to the
Participant as soon as practicable and request further instructions.
D. Core investment funds.
(1) Throughout the time that a Participant-directed investment
program is in effect under this section, the permitted investment
alternatives under the program shall include a group of at least
three investment funds:
(a) Each of whose underlying assets are diversified so as to
minimize the risk of large losses;
(b) Each of which has materially different risk and return
characteristics;
(c) Which in the aggregate enable the Participant by choosing
among them to achieve a portfolio with aggregate risk and
return characteristics at any point within the range normally
appropriate for the Participant;
(d) Each of which, when combined with investments in the other
funds in the group, tends to minimize through diversification
the overall risk of a Participant's portfolio; and
(e) Each of which is either:
[1] An investment company described in § 3(a) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, or a series investment
company described in § 18(f) of the Investment Company
§ 58-73 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-73
1:210
Act of 1940, or any of the segregated portfolios of such
company;
[2] A common or collective trust fund or a pooled investment
fund maintained by a bank or similar institution, a deposit
in a bank or similar institution, or a fixed-rate investment
contract of a bank or similar institution;
[3] A pooled separate account or a fixed-rate investment
contract of an insurance company qualified to do business
in a state; or
[4] Any entity whose assets include plan assets by reason of a
plan's investment in the entity (such as a "group trust" as
defined in Rev. Rul. 81-100).
(2) These investment funds may be Designated Investment
Alternatives, or they may merely be permitted without specific
identification under a general rule allowing investment in broad
categories of assets or in all assets which are administratively
feasible for the Plan to hold.
E. Notice of limited liability. The Administrator (or person designated by
the Administrator to act on its behalf) shall provide each Participant
who is qualified to participate in the participant-directed investment
program with an explanation that the Plan is intended to constitute the
kind of plan described in ERISA § 404(c) and 29 CFR § 2550.404c-1,
and that the Fiduciaries of the Plan may be relieved of liability for any
losses which are the direct and necessary result of investment
instructions given by such Participant.
F. Disclosure of plan-related information. The Administrator (or person
designated by the Administrator to act on its behalf) shall provide to
each Participant the following Plan-related information, based on the
latest information available to the Plan:

may give investment instructions (including the persons to
whom instructions may be given, the times when instructions
may be given, and the manner in which instructions may be
given);
(b) An explanation of any specified limitations on such instructions
under the terms of the Plan, including any restrictions on
transfers to or from a Designated Investment Alternative (such
as absolute restrictions, minimum investment periods,

§ 58-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-73
1:211
(c) A description of or reference to plan provisions or provisions of
the participant-directed investment program relating to the

(d) An identification of any Designated Investment Alternatives
offered under the Plan;
(e) An identification of any designated Investment Managers; and
(f) A description of any "brokerage windows," "self-directed
brokerage accounts," or similar Plan arrangements that enable
Participants to select investments beyond those designated by
the Plan. If the participant-directed investment program does
not limit the investment alternatives to Designated Investment
Alternatives, a general statement of the types of nonidentified
investments that are permitted and the types which are
prohibited, as provided under the rules established for the
participant-directed investment program, shall be a sufficient
description of such investments, provided that Participants are
encouraged to obtain and review materials relating to any such
nonidentified investments prior to actually making an
investment.
(2) Administrative expenses.
(a) Initial and annual disclosure: on or before the date on which a
Participant can first direct his investments, and at least

individual accounts of Participants and are not reflected in the
Total Annual Operating Expenses of any Designated
Investment Alternative, as well as the basis on which such
charges will be allocated (e.g., pro rata, per capita) to, or affect
the balance of, each individual account.
(b) Quarterly disclosure: at least quarterly, a statement that
includes:
[1] The dollar amount of the fees and expenses described in
Subsection F(2)(a) that are actually charged (whether by

individual services;
[2] A description of the services to which the charges relate
(e.g., plan administration, including recordkeeping, legal,

Designated Investment Alternatives (e.g., through revenue
sharing arrangements, Rule 12b-1 fees, subtransfer agent
fees).
(3) Individual expenses.
(a) Initial and annual disclosure: on or before the date on which a
Participant can first direct his investments, and at least
annually thereafter, an explanation of any fees and expenses
that may be charged against the individual account of a

Participant must be furnished a description of such change at least
30 days, but not more than 90 days, in advance of the effective date
of such change, unless the inability to provide such advance notice
is due to events that were unforeseeable or circumstances beyond
the control of the Administrator, in which case notice of such
change must be furnished as soon as reasonably practicable.
G. Automatic and periodic disclosure of investment-related information.
Except as provided in Subsection H, the Administrator (or person
designated by the Administrator to act on its behalf) shall provide to
each Participant the following investment-related information on or
before the date on which a Participant can first direct his investments,

described in Subsection G(2)(b), updated on at least a
quarterly basis, or more frequently if required by other
applicable law; and
(d) The Designated Investment Alternative's fee and expense
information described in Subsection G(4)(b).
I. Comparative format for furnishing investment-related information.
(1) In general. The Administrator (or person designated by the
Administrator to act on its behalf) shall provide the information
required under Subsection G or H in a chart or similar format that
is designed to facilitate a comparison of such information for each
Designated Investment Alternative available under the Plan, that
prominently displays the date, and that includes:
(a) A statement indicating the name, address, and telephone

Administrator to act on its behalf] to contact for the provision
of the information required by Subsection K (relating to
Investment-Related Information to be Provided Upon Request);
(b) A statement that additional investment-related information
(including more current performance information) is available
at the listed Internet website addresses [see Subsections G(5),

(c) A statement explaining how to request and obtain, free of
charge, paper copies of the information required to be made
available on a website pursuant to Subsections G(5), H(1)(g),
and H(2).
(2) Additional information. Nothing in this section shall preclude the
Administrator (or person designated by the Administrator) from
including additional information that the Administrator (or
designee) determines appropriate for such comparisons, provided
such information is not inaccurate or misleading.
(3) Use of model comparative chart. The Administrator (or person
designated by the Administrator) shall be deemed to have satisfied
the requirements of this section if it uses and accurately completes
the model comparative chart in the Appendix to 29 CFR
§ 2550.404a-5.
J. Investment-related information to be provided subsequent to
investment. The Administrator (or person designated by the
Administrator to act on its behalf) shall furnish to each investing
Participant, subsequent to an investment in a Designated Investment
Alternative, any materials provided to the Plan relating to the exercise
of voting, tender, and similar rights appurtenant to the investment, to
§ 58-73 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-73
1:218
the extent such rights are passed through to such Participant under the
terms of the Plan.
K. Investment-related information to be provided upon request. The
Administrator (or person designated by the Administrator to act on its
behalf) shall furnish to each investing Participant, either at the times
specified in Subsection G or upon request, the following information
related to Designated Investment Alternatives:
(1) Copies of prospectuses (or, alternatively, any short-form or
summary prospectus, the form of which has been approved by the
Securities and Exchange Commission) for the disclosure of
information to investors by entities registered under either the
Securities Act of 1933 or the Investment Company Act of 1940, or
similar documents relating to Designated Investment Alternatives
that are provided by entities that are not registered under either of
these Acts;
(2) Copies of any financial statements or reports, such as statements of
additional information and shareholder reports, and of any other
similar materials relating to the Plan's Designated Investment
Alternatives, to the extent such information is provided to the Plan;
(3) A statement of the value of a share or unit of each Designated
Investment Alternative as well as the date of the valuation; and
(4) A list of the assets comprising the portfolio of each Designated
Investment Alternative which constitute "plan assets" within the
meaning of 29 CFR § 2510.3-101, and the value of each such asset
(or the proportion of the investment alternative which it
comprises).
L. Miscellaneous rules relating to disclosures.
(1) Fees and expenses. Except as otherwise explicitly required under
this section, in any disclosure of information by the Administrator
to Participants under this section, fees and expenses may be
expressed in terms of a monetary amount, formula, percentage of
assets, or per capita charge.
(2) Understandable disclosures. The information required to be
prepared by the Administrator for disclosure under this section
shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the
average Plan Participant.
M. Independent control by participants.
(1) In general. The Trustees shall not interfere with the exercise of
independent control by Participants regarding transactions related
to the participant-directed investment program (including, without
limitation, the acquisition or disposition of investments, and the
§ 58-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-73
1:219
exercise of any voting, tender, and similar rights appurtenant to a
Participant's ownership interest in an investment alternative).
(2) Improper influence. No Plan Fiduciary or Plan sponsor shall subject
any Participant to improper influence with regard to any
transaction related to the participant-directed investment program.
(3) Concealment of material nonpublic facts. No Plan Fiduciary shall
conceal any material nonpublic facts regarding an investment from
a Participant, unless the disclosure of such information by the Plan
Fiduciary to the Participant would violate any provision of federal
law or any provision of state law which is not preempted by ERISA.
(4) Incompetent participant. No Plan Fiduciary shall accept the
instructions of any person whom the Plan Fiduciary knows is legally
incompetent.
(5) Transactions involving fiduciary. In the case of any transaction
permitted under the participant-directed investment program and
this section which involves the sale, exchange, or leasing of
property between the Plan and a Plan Fiduciary or an Affiliate of a
Plan Fiduciary, or a loan to a Plan Fiduciary or an Affiliate of a Plan
Fiduciary, the Participant shall not be required to pay more than, or
shall not receive less than, "adequate consideration" [as defined in
ERISA § 3(18) and the regulations thereunder] in connection with
the transaction. (In general terms, "adequate consideration" for a
security traded on a registered national securities exchange is the
prevailing price on such market; for a security not so traded for
which there is a generally recognized market, the current offering
price for the security; and for an asset other than a security for
which there is a generally recognized market, the fair market value
of the asset as determined in good faith by the Plan Fiduciary.)
(6) Investment advice. Neither the Employer nor any Plan Fiduciary
should provide any investment advice to a Participant related to the
participant-directed investment program.
N. Incidents of ownership appurtenant to participant investments. The
Trustees may provide each Participant who has a Plan account invested
in whole or in part in any investment directed by the Participant under
this section with a reasonable opportunity to give instruction with
respect to voting, tender, or similar rights appurtenant to the
Participant's ownership interest in that investment. To the extent that
the Trustees do not pass through such rights to Participants, they shall
not be protected from fiduciary liability with respect to the exercise or
nonexercise of those rights.
O. Segregation; expenses. The portion of any Participant's Plan accounts
which are invested according to Participant instructions under this
section shall be segregated from the rest of the Trust Fund. Such
portion shall not share in any gains or losses of the general Trust Fund,
but shall instead reap the benefits and bear the expenses of the
§ 58-73 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-73
1:220
§ 58-74. Administration.
segregated investments. Where more than one Participant is investing
in the same investment, it is not necessary that the assets allocable
to each Participant be physically segregated from those of other
Participants, so long as they are segregated from other investments and
the Trustees maintain adequate records to disclose the portions of the
investment associated with each Participant. The Plan and Trust may
charge a Participant's account for the reasonable expenses of carrying
out investment instructions, provided that procedures are established
to periodically inform the Participant of the actual expenses incurred
with respect to his/her individual account.
P. ERISA § 404(c) requirements. Although this Plan is not subject to
ERISA Title I, Part 4, fiduciary requirements, the Participant-directed
investment program established under this section is generally
intended to satisfy the requirements established by the U.S.
Department of Labor for "ERISA § 404(c) plans," and this Plan shall be
deemed to incorporate by reference all requirements for ERISA
§ 404(c) plans not otherwise stated, except to the extent the Plan's
language clearly evidences an intent not to follow a particular
requirement. (Cf. 29 CFR §§ 2550.404c-1 and § 2550.404a-5.)
Nonetheless, any failure by a Plan Fiduciary to satisfy any of the
provisions of this section that are designed to comply with
requirements for ERISA § 404(c) plans shall not subject the Plan, any
Fiduciary, or the Employer to any liability to any Participant, Alternate
Payee, or Beneficiary except to the extent such liability would exist
under Pennsylvania law for a municipal government retirement plan
even if the ERISA § 404(c) plan requirements had not been included in
this section, and for those purposes it shall be deemed that such
provisions are not included in this Plan.
A. In general.
(1) In general. The Plan Administrator and named fiduciary of this Plan
shall be the Committee described in this section.
(2) Committee. The Committee shall consist of at least three
individuals, who shall be appointed by the Board of Commissioners
of the Sponsor, and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of
Commissioners of the Sponsor. The initial members of the
Committee shall be the same individuals who serve as the
administrative committee of the South Whitehall Township Police
Pension Plan, the South Whitehall Township Public Works Union
Employees' Pension Plan, and the South Whitehall Township Office
Personnel Pension Plan on the Effective Date. Subsequent
appointments to this Committee shall be made by resolution. Any
member may resign upon written notice to the Board of
Commissioners and the Committee. The Committee shall meet no
less than annually. The Committee may adopt procedures, bylaws,
and regulations as it deems necessary for the conduct of its affairs.
§ 58-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-74
1:221
A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a
quorum, and any action of the Committee shall require the
affirmative vote of a majority of those present at a meeting or,
if action without a meeting is permitted by the Committee's
procedures, bylaws, and regulations, the affirmative vote in writing
of a majority of the members of the Committee.
B. Powers and duties.
(1) In general. The Administrator shall administer the Plan in
accordance with its terms and applicable law, shall direct the
Trustees to make payments in accordance with the Plan from the
Trust under § 58-72I, and shall have all powers necessary to carry
out the provisions of the Plan. The Administrator shall have
absolute and exclusive discretion to decide all issues arising in the
administration, interpretation, and application of the Plan,
including eligibility for benefits. The Administrator may from time
to time set forth rules of interpretation and administration, subject
to modification as appropriate in the light of experience. No such
rule will be ineffective by reason of the fact that such rule may
amend the purely administrative provisions of the Plan or conform
to any changes in the Plan or applicable law relating to qualified
retirement plans. Decisions and rules established by the
Administrator shall be conclusive and binding on all persons. The
Administrator shall act without discrimination among persons
similarly situated at any given time, although it may change its
policies from time to time.
(2) Delegation. Subject to the prohibitions of § 58-75A, the
Administrator may delegate to any person or group of persons its
authority to perform any act under this Plan and Trust, including
those matters involving the exercise of discretion, provided that
such delegation shall be subject to revocation at any time at the
Administrator's discretion.
(3) Designation of Chief Administrative Officer. The Township Manager
shall be the Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan for purposes of
the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act, 53
P.S. § 895.101 et seq., subject to the control of the Administrator.
(4) Employment of professionals and others. Subject to the
prohibitions of § 58-75A, the Administrator may appoint such
accountants, counsel, specialists, consultants, and other persons as
it may deem necessary or desirable in connection with the
administration of this Plan, including persons who may also be
engaged by the Employer or who may be Trustees. The
Administrator shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon, and shall
be fully protected in any action taken in good faith by it in relying
upon, any opinions or reports which shall be furnished to it by any
such accountant, counsel, specialist, or other consultant.
§ 58-74 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-74
1:222
(5) Records. The Administrator shall keep a record of all its
proceedings and acts, and shall keep all such books of account,
records, and other data as may be necessary for the proper
administration of the Plan.
(6) Notifications. The Administrator shall notify the Trustees of all its
actions, and, when required by law, it shall also notify any other
interested persons of its actions.
(7) Reports, documents, and communications. The Administrator (or
Chief Administrative Officer, as applicable) shall prepare and file all
reports and documents required to be filed with a governmental
agency, shall prepare and provide or make available all reports and
documents required to be provided or made available to persons
with an interest under the Plan, and shall communicate with
employees and other persons with respect to all matters relating to
the Plan and Trust, including rights and benefits under this Plan.
C. Direction of trustees.
(1) Direction to request approval. The Administrator may at any time
direct the Trustees in writing to obtain the written approval of the
Administrator before exercising certain of the powers granted the
Trustees under this Plan and Trust. Any such direction may be of a
continuing nature or otherwise, and may be revoked in writing by
the Administrator at any time.
(2) Funding policy and method. The Administrator shall, from time to
time, establish a funding policy and investment objectives and
guidelines for the Trust consistent with the purposes of the Plan
and state and federal law, and shall direct the Trustees to comply
with such policy, objectives, and guidelines. The Administrator
shall periodically review the operation of the Trust and all financial
reports, investment reviews, and other reports prepared for the
Plan or Trust.
(3) Duty to question direction by Administrator. Neither the Trustees
nor any other person shall be under any duty to question a direction
by the Administrator under this section.
D. Compensation and expenses. Members of the Committee shall serve
without compensation for their services. All expenses incident to the
administration of the Plan by the Administrator, including but not
limited to fees of accountants, counsel, consultants, and other
specialists, and other costs of administering the Plan, may be paid by
the Employer, but until and unless they are paid by the Employer they
shall constitute a charge upon the Trust Fund.
E. Standard of care. The Administrator and all accountants, counsel,
specialists, consultants, and others retained by it under Subsection B(4)
shall be subject to the fiduciary requirements detailed in § 58-75.
§ 58-74 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-75
1:223
§ 58-75. Fiduciaries.
A. Prohibition against certain persons holding positions under this plan.
No person may serve under this Plan and Trust as a Fiduciary if he has
been convicted of any of the crimes enumerated in ERISA § 411 until
after the expiration of 13 years from the later of conviction or release
from imprisonment (or such earlier period as allowed under ERISA
§ 411).
B. Bonding. Every Fiduciary and every other person who handles funds or
other property under this Plan (except properly capitalized corporate
fiduciaries organized, doing business, and authorized to exercise trust
powers under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the
United States, and their directors, officers, and employees) should be
bonded in the same manner as if this Plan and Trust were subject to
ERISA § 412 (which generally requires a bond not less than 10% of the
amount of funds handled, though not less than $1,000 nor more than
$500,000), and the Plan may pay the costs and expenses of such bonds.
C. Duty of care. To the extent of their powers, the Fiduciaries shall
discharge their duties with respect to the Plan and Trust:
(1) With the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of
an enterprise of a like character;
(2) By diversifying the investments of the Plan and Trust so as to
minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it
is clearly prudent not to do so; and
(3) In accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
Plan and Trust to the extent they are consistent with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code, and other laws.
D. Duty of loyalty.
(1) Self-dealing. Fiduciaries shall not deal with the income or assets of
the Plan in their own interests or for their own accounts, nor shall
they receive any consideration for their own personal accounts
from any party dealing with the Plan in connection with a
transaction involving the income or assets of the Plan.
(2) Adverse interests. A Fiduciary shall not act in any transaction
involving the Plan on behalf of a party (or represent a party) whose
interests are adverse to the interests of the Plan or the interests of
the Participants, Alternate Payees, or Beneficiaries, whether in his
individual capacity or any other.
E. Prohibited transactions.
§ 58-75 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-75
1:224

Trust, either directly or indirectly, in any Prohibited Transaction or
in any other transaction which is prohibited under Code § 503.
(2) Prohibited transactions. For purposes of this section, the term

less than an adequate consideration in money or money's
worth, to a Disqualified Person; or

(a) The Employer;
(b) A person who has made a substantial contribution to the Plan
or Trust;
(c) A member of the family (as defined in Code § 267(c)(4)) of an
individual described in Subsection E(3)(b); and
(d) A corporation controlled by a person described in Subsection
E(3)(a) or (b) through the ownership, directly or indirectly, of
50% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes
of stock entitled to vote or 50% or more of the total value of
shares of all classes of stock of the corporation.
(4) Definitions. The terms used in this section shall be interpreted in
the same manner as corresponding terms utilized in Code § 503.

1:225
§ 58-76. Amendment, termination and merger.

connection with the Plan, but only to the extent that:
(1) Fiduciary liability insurance is not available to cover the payment of
such item; and
(2) The person is not being relieved of his fiduciary responsibilities and
liabilities to the Plan for breaches of fiduciary obligations.
A. Amendment.
(1) In general. Subject to the provisions of Subsection A(2) and
applicable collective bargaining obligations, the Board of
Commissioners of the Sponsor shall have the right at any time, and
from time to time, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the
provisions of this Plan and Trust, by Ordinance.
(2) Prohibited amendments. No amendment under this section shall be
effective to the extent that it shall:
(a) Exclusive benefit: authorize or permit any part of the Trust
Fund to revert to or become the property of the Employer or
any Related Employer, or to be used or diverted to purposes
other than the exclusive benefit of the Participants,
Beneficiaries, and Alternate Payees, except as permitted under
ERISA and the Code for qualified retirement plans which are
government plans;
(b) Accrued rights: cause any reduction in the accrued benefit of
any Participant, Alternate Payee, or Beneficiary except as
permitted under applicable law;
(c) Trustees: affect the rights, duties, or responsibilities of the
Trustees without the written consent of the Trustees.
B. Termination.
(1) Right to terminate plan. The Sponsor shall have the right to
discontinue its contributions to the Plan and Trust and terminate its
participation under this Plan at any time by Ordinance, subject to
any applicable collective bargaining responsibilities.
(2) Plan accounts. Following a termination of the Plan or complete
discontinuance of Employer contributions to the Plan, the amounts
in the Forfeiture Account and Early Employer Contributions
Account shall be allocated on the day of termination or
discontinuance as if they were end-of-Plan-Year Employer
contributions under § 58-61.
(3) Termination and liquidation of trust. Following a termination of the
Plan, the Sponsor shall terminate the Trust. In that event, the
§ 58-75 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 58-76
1:226
§ 58-77. Miscellaneous.
Trustees shall distribute the accounts of all Plan Participants,
Alternate Payees, and Beneficiaries to such persons as quickly as
possible under the provisions of §§ 58-68, 58-69, and 58-70 as if the
Plan and Trust termination were an event described in § 58-68A.
(4) Termination of trust without termination of plan. The Sponsor may
also elect to terminate the Trust without terminating the Plan so
long as the Sponsor directs the Trustees to transfer the assets of
the Trust Fund to another funding medium for the Plan consistent
with applicable law concerning qualified retirement plans and
plans of Pennsylvania first-class townships, and § 58-72M (relating
to Exclusive Benefit Rule).
(5) Termination or spin-off by related employer. Any Related Employer
(or former Related Employer) which has adopted this Plan and
Trust may at any time elect to terminate its participation in this
Plan and Trust by written notice to the Administrator and the
Trustees, to the extent permitted by state and federal law. In such
event, the Trustee shall segregate assets attributable to employer
and employee contributions (and liabilities allocable to investments
thereof) made by or with respect to employees of the Related
Employer from the Trust Fund and distribute such assets in
accordance with the written directions of the (former) Related
Employer [consistent with applicable law concerning qualified
retirement plans and § 58-72M (relating to Exclusive Benefit
Rule)]. Any election by a Related Employer under this Subsection
B(5) shall be deemed an amendment and separation of the Related
Employer's plan and trust from the provisions of this Plan and Trust
Agreement, and not a termination of the Related Employer's plan,
unless the Related Employer specifically terminates its plan.
C. Merger of plans; transfer of assets.
(1) Definition. For purposes of this section, the term "merger" shall
mean any merger or consolidation of this Plan and/or the Trust
Fund with any other plan, or any transfer of the assets or liabilities
of the Plan and/or the Trust Fund to any other plan.
(2) Accrued rights. The terms of any merger must specify that if this
Plan or its successor were to terminate immediately after the
merger, each Participant shall receive a benefit which is not less
than he/she would have received in the event this Plan terminated
immediately before such merger.
A. Acquittance. This Plan and Trust is purely voluntary on the part of the
Employer. Except as provided in this Plan and Trust document, neither
the establishment of the Trust, any modification thereof, the creation of
any fund or account, nor the payment of any benefits shall be construed
as giving to any Participant or any other person any legal or equitable
§ 58-76 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-77
1:227
right against the Employer, any officer or Employee of the Employer,
the Trustees, or the Administrator. Neither the Trustees, the
Administrator, nor the Employer in any way guarantees the Trust Fund
from loss or depreciation; nor do they guarantee any payment to any
person. The liability of such persons to make any payments hereunder
is limited to the available assets of the Trust Fund.
B. Limitation of liability. Each Employee who becomes a Participant under
this Plan expressly agrees and understands that neither the Employer,
the members of the Administrator, the Trustees in their individual
capacity, nor any of their officers and agents shall be subject in any way
to any suit or litigation, or to any personal liability for any reason
whatsoever in connection with this Plan and Trust or its operation,
except for their willful neglect or fraud.
C. Legal actions. In any action or proceeding involving the Trust Fund, its
administration, or any of its constituent property:
(1) Necessary parties: The only necessary parties shall be the
Employer, the Administrator, and the Trustees;
(2) Notice: No Employees or former Employees of the Employer,
Alternate Payees, Beneficiaries, or any other person having or
claiming to have an interest in the Trust Fund or under the Plan
shall be entitled to any notice or process; and
(3) Final judgment: Any final judgment which is either not appealed or
appealable shall be binding and conclusive on all parties, the
Administrator, and all persons having or claiming to have any
interest in the Trust Fund or under the Plan.
D. Delegation of authority by employer. Whenever any Employer is
permitted or required to do or perform any act, matter, or thing under
this Plan, it shall be done or performed by any officer duly authorized to
perform same by the Employer.
E. Clerical errors.
(1) If the Administrator discovers that a person who should have
received any contribution or allocation under this Plan for any Plan
Year did not receive it, or did not receive as large a contribution or
allocation as he should have, the Employer shall make a
contribution for such person in the amount erroneously omitted,
plus the amount of Income which would have been earned by such
contribution had it been timely made.
(2) Conversely, if the Administrator discovers that a person received a
contribution or allocation under this Plan for any Plan Year to which
he was not entitled, the amount of such erroneous contribution or
allocation shall be deducted from the person's account and
transferred to the Early Employer Contributions Account (where it
shall be treated as being a contribution derived from state aid).

1:228
F. Construction. This Plan and Trust Agreement shall be construed and

the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Further, this Plan and Trust
Agreement shall be construed and administered so as to conform to the
applicable requirements for qualification under Code §§ 401(a) and
501(a) and shall be deemed amended automatically to conform to such
legal requirements as in effect from time to time to the extent
necessary.
G. Gender and number. Whenever any words are used in this Plan and
Trust in the masculine gender, they shall be construed as though they
were also used in the feminine gender in all appropriate cases.
Whenever any words are used in either the singular or plural form, they
shall be construed as though they were also used in the other form in all
appropriate cases.
H. Headings. Section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, clause,
subclause, and other headings are included in this article for
convenience only and shall in no manner be construed as a part of this
Plan and Trust Agreement.
I. Severability. Any provision of this Plan which is prohibited or
unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the
remaining provisions of this Plan. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Employer and Trustees hereby waive any provision of law
which renders any provision of this Plan prohibited or unenforceable in
any respect.
J. Employment rights. Nothing contained in this Plan and Trust shall be
construed or interpreted as giving any employee of the Employer the
right to be retained in the service of any Employer or shall affect or
impair any terms of employment with any Employer, the right of any
Employer to control its employees, and the right of any Employer to
terminate the service of any employee at any time.
K. Communications.
(1) To administrator or trustees. All elections, designations, requests,
notices, instructions, or other communications made to the
Administrator or the Trustees shall be in such form as may be
prescribed by the Administrator or the Trustees and shall be mailed
by first-class mail or delivered to such location as shall be specified
by the Administrator or the Trustees, or transmitted to them in
some other manner approved by the Administrator or Trustee (e.g.,
fax, e-mail, action on an Internet web page, etc.). The
communication shall be deemed to have been given and delivered
only upon actual receipt thereof at such location.
(2) By administrator, trustees, or employer. All notices, statements,
reports, or other communications from the Administrator, the
Trustees, or the Employer to any person with an interest under this

1:229
Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered to,
or when mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid and addressed
to, such person at his address last appearing on the records of the
Administrator, the Trustees, or the Employer.
L. Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this article, all benefits with respect to a
Participant under this Plan are subject to partial or complete forfeiture
in accordance with the provisions of the Public Employee Pension
Forfeiture Act, 43 P.S. § 1311 et seq. Any amounts so forfeited which are
subject to restitution to the Employer or another person or entity under
the Act shall be so paid in accordance with the restitution order. Any
amounts so forfeited which are not subject to restitution to the

H. It shall be the obligation of each cable operator to serve all residents of
the Township except to the extent that density of homes, adverse

operator authorized to operate within the Township, then or in the
future from using such easement to extend other and further lines
to such subdivision and/or land development. In each new
subdivision and each new land development, the developer shall,
upon notifying public utilities of the opportunity to serve such
subdivision or land development, also notify all cable operators
licensed to operate a cable system in the Township of South

cable operators currently doing business in the Township of South Whitehall
believe that the franchise fee each pays to the Township is a tax. The Board
believes the franchise fee is an administrative fee for the placement of cable

Board agrees to forebear from the collection of business privilege taxes
from any cable operator providing cable services within the Township of
South Whitehall, provided:
A. Such cable operator does not maintain a place of business within the
Township of South Whitehall and does maintain a place of business in
another municipality, which other municipality levies and collects a
business privilege tax from such cable operator.
B. Such cable operator promptly complies with all payment and
performance requirements of this chapter.

to be an exclusive grant to any one operator of a community antenna system
so as to prevent the granting of similar privileges to others.
§ 133-10. Permission required for use of privately owned property.
Nothing herein shall be interpreted as meaning that the Township of South
Whitehall conveys or gives the right to use the now existing poles or
facilities or property of the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, Bell
Telephone Company or any utility, railroad or private corporation, person
or partnership, without first obtaining written permission from said parties,
which written permission shall be filed with the Secretary of the Township
of South Whitehall before any erection or field work is performed.

580]

Commissioners or by the utility, railroad, private corporation, person or
partnership now using such facilities and such facilities are not removed,
then upon 60 days notice from the Township the said wires, equipment
and cables being used at such location shall be removed at the expense of
the cable operator of the cable system and its heirs, executors, successors,
trustees, including trustees in bankruptcy, and assigns, within said time as
ordered, and the Board of Commissioners shall have the right to declare any
and all privileges granted withdrawn and forfeited.
A. Any privilege and permission granted under this chapter shall be by
ordinance of the Board of Commissioners of the Township of South
Whitehall and may at any time upon cause and after public hearing be
revoked by ordinance of the Commissioners of the Township of South
Whitehall and shall, at all times, be exercised and maintained subject to
the approval of the Commissioners of the Township of South Whitehall.

work a forfeiture of any permission and privileges that may have been
granted.

of video programming during normal broadcasting hours on a
continuing basis which shall include local educational TV channel or
channels.

conduct, business or utilization of the facilities on or about any premises.
Despite the assessment of a civil penalty pursuant to § 144-24 of this article,

A. Upon refusal or neglect of the person or entity served with a written
notice pursuant to Municipal Building Code of South Whitehall

the civil penalty for each such failure to comply with an abatement
order shall be not more than $1,000, plus costs of the enforcement
action, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Each day that the failure

may be in effect in identified floodplain areas and which regulate identified
floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance, resolution and/or

Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 181-18. Floodplain area established.
§ 181-19. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be:
(1) Any areas of Township of South Whitehall classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated July 16,
2004, and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital
data developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study; and
(2) Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Township of South Whitehall
and declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the Township
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
§ 181-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-19
1:337
§ 181-20. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board
of Commissioners where studies or information provided by a qualified
agency or person documents the need for such revision. However, prior
to any such change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be
obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later
than six months after the date such information becomes available, the
Township shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard
area by submitting technical or scientific data. See § 181-23B for situations
where FEMA notification is required.
§ 181-21. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator, and
any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Township Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the procedures set
forth in § 181-17 of this chapter. The burden of proof shall be on the
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
C. A Area/District.
(1) The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no
base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where
other acceptable information is not available, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on
the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site.
(2) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality.
D. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where
Township of South Whitehall has identified local flood hazard or
ponding areas, as delineated and adopted on a Local Flood Hazard Map
using best available topographic data and locally derived information
such as flood of record, historic high-water marks, soils or approximate
study methodologies.

appellant to establish a floodplain boundary inconsistent with the
Floodplain Administrator's determination.
§ 181-22. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the Township
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The Township shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

may be affected by such action have been notified by the Township,
and until all required permits or approvals have first been obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection regional office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When the Township proposes to permit the following encroachments:
any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within
the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and Zone
AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a
stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges), the
applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12) apply to FEMA for conditional
approval of such action prior to permitting the encroachments to occur.
(1) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, the
Township shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
(2) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, the Township
shall require that the applicant provide as-built certifications.
FEMA will initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such
certifications in accordance with 44 CFR Part 67.
C. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance

structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT — Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage or repetitive loss, regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by

of a plat which has been approved as provided by the MPC.
F. The adoption of any street, street lines or other public lands pursuant to
this article as part of the Official Map shall not, in and of itself,
constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of

§ 274-15. Short title.
This Part 4 shall be known, and may be cited as Township's "Wastewater
Discharge Limitations Ordinance."
§ 274-16. Purpose.87
It is declared that the enactment of this Part 4 is necessary for the
protection, benefit and preservation of the health, safety and welfare of
the inhabitants of this Township and the users and operators of the sewer
system. This Part 4 is also enacted to comply with agreements which require
the Township and Authority to conform to uniform requirements for users
of the publicly owned treatment works for the City of Allentown. Such
requirements enable the City, the Township and the Authority to comply
with all the applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water
Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) and the general pretreatment regulations (40
CFR, Part 403). The objectives of those requirements are:
A. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment
works that will interfere with its operation.
B. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned
treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment
works, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be
incompatible with the publicly owned treatment works.
C. To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment
and the general public.
D. To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the publicly owned treatment works.
E. To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance and improvement of the publicly owned
treatment works.
F. To enable the City to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal
requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the publicly
owned treatment works is subject.

special agreement or arrangement between the Authority, the City, and any
person whereby wastes of unusual strength or character may be admitted
into the sewer system and the POTW by the Authority and the City either
before or after preliminary treatment. However, no such special agreement
or arrangement shall allow violation of federal pretreatment requirements
or any other applicable federal or state requirements. Whenever the
Authority shall deem it necessary for the protection and safe, economical
and efficient management of the POTW, the owner of an improved property
shall provide at the owner's expense such facilities for preliminary
treatment and processing of industrial waste as may be necessary to reduce
BOD to 300 mg/l, suspended solids to 360 mg/l, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen
to 85 mg/l.

Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations
§ 274-66. Upset.
§ 274-67. Prohibited discharge standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 274-18B or
A. Definition. For purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the user. An "upset" does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventative maintenance or careless or improper operation.
B. Affirmative defense. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to
an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards if the user shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence, that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) or the
upset.
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures.
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the Authority
and the Manager of Water Resources within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five calendar days:153
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue.
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
C. Burden of proof. In any enforcement action, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
D. Limitation. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination
on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.

the specific prohibitions in § 274-18C(1) through (3) and (6) through (23),
if the user can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know that
its discharge, alone or in combination with discharges from other sources,
would cause pass through or interference, and that either:
§ 274-68. Bypass.
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference.
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in
nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City
was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
A. Definitions. For purposes of this section:
BYPASS — The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion
of a user's treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE — Substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the POTW which causes them to become
inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources
which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.
Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays
in production.154
B. Bypass permitted for certain maintenance. A user may allow any bypass
to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements
to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure
efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions
Subsections C and D.
C. Notice.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Authority and the Manager of Water Resources
at least 10 days before the date of the bypass, if possible.155
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the Authority and the Manager of
Water Resources of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours after the time
the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five calendar days after the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass, unless the oral report was received
within 24 hours and the written report is waived by the Authority
and the Manager of Water Resources on a case-by-case basis.156

(3) The written submission shall contain:
(a) A description of the bypass and its cause.
(b) The duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time
it is expected to continue.
(c) Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass.
D. Prohibition; justification.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Authority, Township or the Manager
of Water Resources may take enforcement action against a user for
a bypass, unless:157
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage.
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventative maintenance.
(c) The user submitted notices as required under Subsection C.
(2) The Authority and the Manager of Water Resources may approve
an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the
Authority and the Manager of Water Resources determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection D(1), above.158

General Provisions
§ 296-1. Title. [Amended 7-17-2002 by Ord. No. 756; 3-16-2005 by
Ord. No. 811]
This chapter shall be known as the "South Whitehall Township Stormwater
Management Plan for portions of the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed, Coplay
Creek Watershed and Jordan Creek Watershed located within South
Whitehall Township."
§ 296-2. Statement of findings. [Amended 3-16-2005 by Ord. No.
811]
The Township Commissioners find that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout the watersheds of the Township
increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, changes the natural hydrologic patterns, destroys
aquatic habitat, elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge and
threatens public health and safety. [Amended 4-18-2007 by Ord. No.
855]
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety and
welfare and the protection of the people of the Township and all the
people of the Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality. [Amended 6-15-2005
by Ord. No. 813]
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater. [Amended
6-15-2005 by Ord. No. 813]
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES). [Amended 6-15-2005 by Ord. No.

§ 296-9. General requirements. [Amended 7-17-2002 by Ord. No.
756; 3-16-2005 by Ord. No. 811]
A. All regulated activities in the Township shall be subject to the
stormwater management requirements of this chapter. [Amended
6-15-2005 by Ord. No. 813]
B. Storm drainage system shall be provided to permit unimpeded flow in
natural watercourses except as modified by stormwater detention
facilities or open channels consistent with this chapter.
C. The existing points of concentrated drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without written approval of the affected
property owner(s).
D. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent property
shall be managed such that, at minimum, the peak diffused flow does
not increase in the general direction of discharge, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated
and discharged onto adjacent property (including flows from detention
basin emergency spillways), the developer's engineer must document
and certify that there are adequate downstream conveyance facilities to
safely transport the concentrated discharge to the point of
predevelopment flow concentration, to the stream reach, or otherwise
prove that no harm will result from the concentrated discharge. It is
recommended the developer obtain written permission from the
downstream property owner(s) for the proposed discharges. Areas of
existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable
release rate criteria in the general direction of existing discharge
where they are proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused
drainage areas. [Amended 4-18-2007 by Ord. No. 855]
E. Where a site is traversed by watercourses, swales, ditches, etc., there
shall be provided drainage easements conforming substantially with the
line of such watercourses, swales, ditches, etc. The width of any
easement shall be adequate to provide for unimpeded flow of postdevelopment
storm runoff based on either calculations completed by
the developer in conformance with § 296-15 for the one-hundred-year
return period runoff, the Little Lehigh Creek, Coplay Creek or Jordan
Creek Act 167 one-hundred-year return period flows, or Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) one-hundred-year frequency
flood flows and to provide a freeboard allowance of 0.5 foot above the
design water surface level. In all areas, the flow rate to be utilized shall
be the maximum rate identified through either developer's calculations,
the Little Lehigh Creek, Coplay Creek or Jordan Creek Act 167 or (if
applicable) FEMA study flows. In areas where the Act 167 flow rate is
the maximum rate, this rate shall be used unless a reduced flow rate is
determined by the Lehigh Valley Planning Commission to take
§ 296-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 296-9
1:519
precedence over the Act 167 flow rate. This maximum flow rate shall be
used to determine the one-hundred-year water surface elevations based
on HEC-RAS modeling (or other modeling method as approved by the
municipality). The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement in
the post-development condition. Also, periodic maintenance of the
easement to ensure proper runoff conveyance shall be required.
Watercourses for which the one-hundred-year floodplain is formally
defined by FEMA studies are subject to the applicable municipal
floodplain regulations. All proposed buildings within or adjacent to a
floodplain as defined by FEMA studies shall have first floor elevations
at lease 1.5 feet above the one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation.
The one-hundred-year flood elevation to be used to establish the first
floor elevation shall be determined using the greater of the maximum
flow rate referenced in FEMA study flows, Act 167 flows, or calculated
flows as set forth above. [Amended 4-18-2007 by Ord. No. 855]
F. Any drainage facilities or structures required by this chapter that are
located on state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to approval by
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
G. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage swales on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage,
open channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line
and grade of such natural drainage swales. Capacities of open channels
shall be calculated using the Manning Equation.
H. Storm drainage facilities and appurtenances shall be so designed and
provided as to minimize erosion in watercourse channels and at all
points of discharge.
I. Consideration should be given to the design and use of volume controls
for stormwater management, where geology and soils permit. Areas of
suitable geology for volume controls shall be determined by the
Township. Documentation of the suitability of the soil for volume
controls shall be provided by the applicant. Volume controls shall be
acceptable in areas of suitable geology where the soils are designated
as well drained in the County Soil Survey. Other soils may be acceptable
for use of volume controls based on site-specific soils evaluations
provided by the applicant.
J. Within areas containing soils identified by the Soils Conservation
Service to be sinkhole prone, basins shall be lined with a material
which, after installation, attains a permeability rate of less than or
equal to 1 x 10-7 cm/sec. [Amended 4-18-2007 by Ord. No. 855]

Code § 102.4(b).
C. A DEP NPDES Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction
Activities Permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities
under Pa. Code Chapter 92.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the Township before the
commencement of earth disturbance activity.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a drainage plan which
demonstrates compliance with this chapter. This chapter provides
standards to meet NPDES permit requirements associated with
construction activities and MS4 permit requirements.
B. The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The
WQv shall be calculated two ways.
(1) First, WQv shall be calculated using the following formula:
§ 296-10 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 296-12
1:522
Where:
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
c = Rational Method post-development runoff coefficient
for the two-year storm
P = 1.25 inches
A = Area in acres of proposed regulated activity
(2) Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff
volume from predevelopment to post-development for the two-year
return period storm. The effect of closed depressions on the site
shall be considered in this calculation. The larger of these two
calculated volumes shall be used as the WQv to be captured and
treated, except that in no case shall the WQv be permitted to
exceed 1.25 inches of runoff over the site area. This standard does
not limit the volume of infiltration an applicant may propose for
purposes of water quantity/peak rate control.
C. The WQv shall be calculated for each post-development drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious
cover and no proposed disturbance during development may be
excluded from the WQv calculations and do not require treatment.
D. If an applicant is proposing to use a dry extended detention basin, wet
pond, constructed wetland or other BMP that ponds water on the land
surface and may receive direct sunlight, the discharge from that BMP
must be treated by infiltration, a vegetated buffer, filter strip,
bioretention, vegetated swale or other BMP that provides a thermal
benefit to protect the high quality waters of the Little Lehigh Creek
from thermal impacts.
E. The WQv for a site as a result of the regulated activities must either be
treated with infiltration or two acceptable BMPs such as those listed in
Subsection O, except for minor areas on the periphery of the site that
cannot reasonably be drained to an infiltration facility or other BMP.
F. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill unless the applicant
demonstrates that the fill is stable and otherwise meets the infiltration
BMP standards of this chapter.
G. The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site
from published sources. Any apparent boundaries between carbonate
§ 296-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 296-12
1:523
and noncarbonate bedrock shall be verified through more detailed site
evaluations by a qualified geotechnical professional.
H. For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed where an
applicant intends to use infiltration BMP's, the applicant shall conduct a
preliminary site investigation, including gathering data from published
sources, a field inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a
minimum of two percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix G.196 This
investigation will determine depth to bedrock, depth to the seasonal
high water table, soil permeability and location of special geologic
features, if applicable. This investigation may be done by a certified
Sewage Enforcement Officer (SEO) except that the location(s) of
special geologic features shall be verified by a qualified geotechnical
professional. Additionally, the Township Geotechnical Consultant or its
authorized representative shall be notified of the soil testing in order to
observe any such testing as determined to be necessary.
I. Sites where applicants intend to use infiltration BMPs must meet the
following criteria:
(1) Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
(2) Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet; except for infiltration of
residential roof runoff where the seasonal high water table must be
below the invert of the BMP. (If the depth to bedrock is between
two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high water
table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the depth
to seasonal high water table is required.)
(3) Soil permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 PA Code § 73.15.
percolation test in Appendix G197) greater than or equal to 0.5
inches/hour and less than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
(4) Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(a) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(b) Fifteen feet down gradient or 100 feet upgradient from
building foundations; except for residential development
where the required setback is 15 feet downgradient or 40 feet
upgradient from building foundations.
(c) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields; except for residential
development where the required setback is 25 feet from septic
system drainfields.

197. Editor's Note: Appendix G is on file in the Township offices.
§ 296-12 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 296-12
1:524
(d) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock
unless a preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate
bedrock to show the absence of special geologic features
within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(e) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from existing or potential
future wells, foundations and drainfields on neighboring
properties will be met; except for one- and two-family
residential dwellings where the required setback is 40 feet
unless documentation is provided to show that all setbacks
from existing or potential future wells, foundations and
drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
J. For entirely noncarbonate sites, the recharge volume (REv) shall be
infiltrated unless the applicant demonstrates that it is infeasible to
infiltrate the REv for reasons of seasonal high water table, permeability
rate, soil depth or setback distances; or except as provided in
Subsection U.
(1) The REv shall be calculated as follows:
REv = (0.25)*(I)/12
Where:
REv = Recharge volume in acre-feet
I = Impervious area in acres
(2) The preliminary site investigation described in Subsection H is
required and shall continue on different areas of the site until a
potentially suitable infiltration location is found or the entire site is
determined to be infeasible for infiltration. For infiltration areas
that appear to be feasible based on the preliminary site
investigation, the additional site investigation and testing as
outlined in Appendix G198 shall be completed.
(3) If an applicant proposes infiltration, the municipality may
determine infiltration to be infeasible if there are known existing
conditions or problems that may be worsened by the use of
infiltration.
(4) The site must meet the conditions listed in Subsection I.
(5) If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full REv, the applicant shall
infiltrate that portion of the REv that is feasible based on the site
characteristics. If none of the REv can be infiltrated, REv shall be
considered as part of the WQv and shall be captured and treated as
described in Subsection O.
198. Editor's Note: Appendix G is on file in the Township offices.
§ 296-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 296-12
1:525
(6) If REv is infiltrated, it may be subtracted from the WQv required to
be captured and treated.
K. In entirely carbonate areas, where the applicant intends to us
infiltration BMPs, the preliminary site investigation described in
Subsection H shall be conducted. For infiltration areas that appear
feasible based on the preliminary site investigation, the applicant shall
conduct the additional site investigation and testing as outlined in
Appendix G.199 The soil depth, percolation rate and proposed loading
rate, each weighted as described in § 296-15, along with the buffer from
special geologic features shall be compared to the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D200 to determine if the site is recommended for
infiltration. In addition to the recommendation from Appendix D, the
conditions listed in Subsection I are required for infiltration in
carbonate areas. Applicants are encouraged to infiltrate the REv, as
calculated in Subsection J, but are not required to use infiltration BMPs
on a carbonate site even if the site falls in the "Recommended" range on
the chart in Appendix D. Any amount of volume infiltrated can be
subtracted from the WQv to be treated by noninfiltration BMPs. If
infiltration is not proposed, the full WQv shall be treated by two
acceptable BMPs, as specified in Subsection O.
L. If a site has both carbonate and noncarbonate areas, the applicant shall
investigate the ability of the noncarbonate portion of the site to fully
meet this chapter to meet the requirements for REv for the whole site
through infiltration. If that proves infeasible, infiltration in the
carbonate area as described in Subsection K or two other
noninfiltration BMPs as described in Subsection O must be used. No
infiltration structure in the noncarbonate area shall be located within
50 feet of a boundary with carbonate bedrock, except when a
preliminary site investigation has been done showing the absence of
special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration
area.
M. If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the postdevelopment
two-year runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80% or
more of the predevelopment runoff volume for the carbonate portion of
the site to prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the
predevelopment infiltration volume.
N. Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance
and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
O. If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each
discharge location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area can be
199. Editor's Note: Appendix G is on file in the Township offices.
200. Editor's Note: Appendix D is on file in the Township offices.
§ 296-12 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 296-12
1:526
considered as one BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and
concentrated flow shall flow through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an
impervious area is to be drained across a pervious area as one BMP,
the length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the
length of impervious area. In no case may the same BMP be employed
consecutively to meet the requirement of this section. Acceptable BMPs
are listed below along with the recommended reference for design.

Q. The use of infiltration BMPs is prohibited on hot spot land use areas.
R. Stormwater infiltration BMPs shall not be placed in or on a special
geologic feature(s). Additionally, stormwater runoff shall not be
discharged into existing on-site sinkholes.
S. Applicants shall request, in writing, public water suppliers to provide
the Zone I Wellhead Protection radius, as calculated by the method
outlined in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Wellhead Protection regulations, for any public water supply well
within 400 feet of the site. In addition to the setback distances specified
in Subsection I, infiltration is prohibited in the Zone I radius as defined
and substantiated by the public water supplier in writing. If the
applicant does not receive a response from the public water supplier,
the Zone I radius is assumed to be 100 feet.
T. The volume and rate of the net increase in stormwater runoff from the
regulated activities must be managed to prevent the physical
degradation of receiving waters from such effects as scour and stream
bank destabilization, to satisfy state water quality requirements, by
controlling the two-year post-development runoff to a 30% release rate.
U. The municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative
methods for meeting the state water quality requirements other than
those in this section, provided that they meet the minimum
requirements of and do not conflict with state law, including but not
limited to the Clean Streams Law.201
A. Mapping of Stormwater management districts. To implement the
provisions of the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed, Coplay Creek
Watershed and Jordan Creek Watershed stormwater management plan,
the Township is hereby divided into stormwater management districts
consistent with the Little Lehigh Creek, Coplay Creek and Jordan Creek
release rate maps presented in the plan. The boundaries of the
stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is
available for inspection at the Township Community Development
Department office. A copy of the official map at a reduced scale is
included in Appendix A202 for general reference.
B. Description of stormwater management districts. Two types of
stormwater management districts may be applicable to the Township,
namely conditional/provisional no detention districts and dual release
rate districts as described below: [Amended 4-18-2007 by Ord. No.
855]
201. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
202. Editor's Note: Appendix A is on file in the Township offices.
§ 296-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 296-13
1:531
§ 296-14. Stormwater management district implementation
provisions. [Amended 3-16-2005 by Ord. No. 811; 6-15-2005 by Ord.
No. 813; 4-18-2007 by Ord. No. 855]
(1) Conditional/provisional no detention districts. Within these
districts, the capacity of the "local" runoff conveyance facilities (as
defined in Article II) must be calculated to determine if adequate
capacity exists. For this determination, the developer must
calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as
proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the
existing condition. The developer must also calculate peak flows
assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current
zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls
specified by this chapter. The larger of the two peak flows
calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists.
If adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site
to the main channel (as defined in Article II), these watershed areas
may discharge post-development peak runoff without detention
facilities. If the capacity calculations show that the local runoff
conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity, the developer shall
either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased
capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows
consistent with § 296-14P. Any capacity improvements must be
designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary
to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified
in § 296-14D. By definition, a storm drainage problem area
associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that
adequate capacity does not exist. Sites in these districts are still
required to meet all of the water quality requirements in § 296-12.
(2) Dual release rate districts. Within these districts, the two-year postdevelopment
peak discharge must be controlled to 30% of the
predevelopment two-year runoff peak. Further, the ten-year- ,
twenty-five-year- and one-hundred-year post-development peak
runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the
predevelopment peak. Release rates associated with the tenthrough
one-hundred-year events vary from 50% to 100%
depending upon location in the watershed.
A. Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and post construction
stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of
discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the
provisions of this chapter.
B. Any stormwater management controls required by this chapter and
subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release
rate criteria for each of the two- , ten- , twenty-five- and one-hundredyear
return period runoff events consistent with the calculation
methodology specified in § 296-15.
§ 296-13 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 296-14
1:532
C. The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours
provided as part of the drainage plan. The district boundaries as
originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or, in certain
instances, are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a
physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a
potential flow obstruction (e.g., road, culvert, bridge, etc.). The physical
feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea
boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide
along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
D. Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
chapter shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
E. For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
applicable release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple
directions of runoff discharge, individual drainage directions may be
designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from
the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
F. For a proposed development site located within two or more release
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be
the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by
subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from
multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak
discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the
overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate.
G. For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate
category subarea and partially within a conditional/provisional no
detention subarea, the size of the predevelopment drainage area on a
site may not be changed post-development to create potentially adverse
§ 296-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 296-14
1:533
conditions on downstream properties except as part of a no harm or
hardship waiver procedure.
H. No portion of a site may be regraded to redirect runoff onto adjacent
property except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure, or
unless runoff peak flow rate and volume controls are proposed and
implemented which limit post-development peak flow rate and volume
discharges to predevelopment levels, or all affected downstream
property owners have granted express permission in the form of
recorded easements.
I. Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site
which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design
release from the site will be the lesser of (1) the applicable release rate
flow assuming no closed depression(s) or (2) the existing peak flow
actually leaving the site. In cases where (2) would result in an
unreasonably small design release, the design discharge of less than or
equal to the release rate will be determined by the available
downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using
Subsection D and the minimum orifice criteria.
J. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site using the capacity
criteria in Subsection D and the detention criteria in § 296-15.
K. For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied
to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All
site tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of
whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that
time. An exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series
where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated
release rate.
L. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact
area shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area
includes any proposed cover or grading changes.
M. Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged
from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the
release rate provisions of this chapter.
N. "No harm" water quantity option. For any proposed development site
not located in a conditional/provisional no detention district, the
developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control
(including no detention) if the developer can prove that special
circumstances exist for the proposed development site and that no
harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that
§ 296-14 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 296-14
1:534
specified by the plan. Special circumstances are defined as any
hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not
specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control
strategy. Proof of no harm would have to be shown from the
development site through the remainder of the downstream drainage
network to the confluence of the creek with the Delaware or Lehigh
River. Proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria
specified in Subsection D if downstream capacity analysis is a part
of the no harm justification. Attempts to prove no harm based upon
downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by
the following provisions:
(1) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two- , ten- , twenty-five- and onehundred-
year) shall be the values from the calibrated PSRM Model
for the Little Lehigh Creek, Coplay Creek or Jordan Creek or as
calculated by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable to
the municipality. The flow values from the PSRM Model would be
supplied to the developer by the Lehigh Valley Planning
Commission upon request.
(2) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as
documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in
proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total
upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity (i.e., if
his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage, he may use
up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity).
(3) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would,
by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to prove no
harm, except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements
for the problem areas consistent with Subsection P.
Any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Article IV. Developers
submitting no harm justifications must still meet all of the water
quality requirements in § 296-12.
O. Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required
release rate at the point of discharge.
P. Capacity improvements. In certain instances, primarily within the
conditional/provisional no detention areas, local drainage conditions
§ 296-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 296-14
1:535
§ 296-15. Calculation methodology. [Amended 3-16-2005 by Ord.
No. 811; 6-15-2005 by Ord. No. 813]
may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based
upon protection of the entire watershed. In these instances, if the
developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity
improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage
network, then the capacity improvements could be provided by the
developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site. Peak flow
calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in
the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is
developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls.
Any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of
the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in Subsection
D. All new development in the entire subarea(s) within which the
proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement
the developer's proposed discharge control, if any. Capacity
improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any
regional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm
option which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that
a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm
downstream.
Q. Compatibility with NPDES requirements. Any proposed regulated
activity for which a permanent stormwater quality control detention
basin is required under the NPDES regulations shall use the more
stringent runoff control criteria between this chapter and the NPDES
requirements.
R. In any stormwater management district, the Township reserves the
right to require a more stringent design release rate for a development
site or other amendments to a drainage plan to address problems in the
local runoff conveyance system downstream of the site. Such problems
include existing flooding and erosion problems, inadequate conveyance
capacity, poorly defined or poorly stabilized downstream conveyance
systems or other factors; or for other good cause shown; and supported
by engineering data of the kind and type commonly accepted by the
civil engineering profession in the evaluation and management of
stormwater runoff.
S. In any stormwater management district, storm sewer piping, swales
and inlet systems shall be designed for a twenty-five-year return period
storm, or a one-hundred-year return period storm where the system is
designed to convey one-hundred-year storm flows to a detention facility.
Bridges and culverts along roadways shall be designed to convey the
one-hundred-year return period storm. Flows from off-site upstream
areas shall be determined in accordance with the procedure identified
in § 296-9E.
A. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the Soil-Cover-Complex methodology.
§ 296-14 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 296-15
1:536
The following requirements apply unless an alternate methodology is
expressly approved by the municipality: [Amended 4-18-2007 by
Ord. No. 855]
(1) For drainage areas of less than 100 acres, the Rational Method
shall be used.
(2) For drainage areas of 100 acres or more, the Soil Conservation
Service Method shall be used.
B. Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D203 shall be calculated as follows:
Area Tributary to infiltration BMP
*100%
Base area of infiltration BMP
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
All disturbed areas to be made impervious: weight at 100%
All disturbed areas to be made pervious: weight at 50%
All undisturbed pervious areas: weight at 0%
All existing impervious areas: weight at 100%
C. Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration system. The effective soil thickness in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D204 is the measured soil thickness multiplied by
the thickness factor based on soil permeability (as measured by the
adapted 25 PA Code § 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G205), as
follows: [Amended 4-18-2007 by Ord. No. 855]
Permeability Range* Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hour 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hour 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hour 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 inches/hour 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 inches/hour 1.0

§ 296-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 296-15
1:537
NOTES:
* If the permeability rate (as measured by the adapted 25 PA Code
§ 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G206) falls on a break between
two thickness factors, the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
Sites with soil permeability greater than 12.0 in/hr or less than 0.5 in/
hr, as measured by the adapted 25 PA Code § 73.15 percolation test in
Appendix G, are not recommended for infiltration.
D. The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this chapter shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through the proposed basin using the storage indication method or
other methodology demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins
designed using the Rational Method technique, the design hydrograph
for routing shall be the Universal Rational Hydrograph unless another
methodology is approved by the municipality. [Amended 4-18-2007
by Ord. No. 855]
E. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the storage indication method.
F. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below
the lowest outlet invert.
G. Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv
shall assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet
is full at the beginning of design event routing for the purposes of
evaluating peak outflows. All wet detention ponds shall be subject to
review by the Township Geotechnical Consultant. [Amended
4-18-2007 by Ord. No. 855]
H. All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum 1.0 foot
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation associated with the twothrough
twenty-five-year runoff events. A 0.5 foot freeboard shall be
provided above the maximum pool elevation of the one-hundred-year
runoff event. The freeboard shall be measured from the maximum pool
elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The two through onehundred-
year storm events shall be controlled by the primary outlet
structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be designed to
pass the one-hundred-year return frequency storm peak basin inflow
rate with a minim 0.5 feet freeboard measured to the top of basin. The
freeboard criteria shall be met considering any off-site areas tributary
to the basin as developed, as applicable. If this detention facility is
considered to be a dam as per DEP Chapter 105, the design of the
facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105 regulations, and may
be required to pass a storm greater than the one-hundred-year event.

I. The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lesser
size orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be
acceptable provided that as much of the site runoff as practical is
directed to the detention facilities.
J. Runoff calculations using the Soil-Cover-Complex Method shall use the
Natural Resources Conservation Service Type II twenty-four-hour
rainfall distribution. The twenty-four-hour rainfall depths for the
various return periods to be used consistent with this chapter may be
taken from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 or the PennDOT Intensity-
Duration-Frequency Field Manual (PDT-IDF) (May 1986) for Region 4.
The following values are taken from the PDT-IDF Field Manual:
Return Period 24 Hour Rainfall Depth

NOTES:
A graphical and tabular presentation of the Type II 24 hour distribution
is included in Appendix C.207
K. Runoff calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration and
return periods and NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 2.1, 2004 or the
Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves as presented in Appendix C.208
[Amended 4-18-2007 by Ord. No. 855]
L. Runoff Curve Numbers (CN's) to be used in the soil-cover-complex
method shall be based upon the matrix presented in Appendix C.209

(1) Sheet Flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS
average velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or
the modified kinematic wave travel time equation (equation 3-3,
NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If using the modified kinematic wave
travel time equation, the sheet flow length shall be limited to 50
feet for designs using the Rational Method and limited to 150 feet
for designs using the Soil-Cover-Complex method.

calculated by the Manning Equation. Bankfull flows shall be used
for determining velocities. Manning 'n' values shall be based on the
table presented in Appendix C.211
(4) Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated using the Manning Equation assuming full flow and the
Manning 'n' values from Appendix C.212
O. If using the Rational Method, all predevelopment calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and off-site drainage areas. All
post-development calculations for a given discharge direction shall be
based on a common time of concentration considering both on-site and
any off-site drainage areas.
P. The Manning Equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of
watercourses. Manning 'n' values used in the calculations shall be
consistent with the table presented in Appendix C213 or other
appropriate standard engineering 'n' value resources. Pipe capacities
shall be determined by methods acceptable to the Township Engineer.
Q. The Pennsylvania DEP, Chapter 105, Rules and Regulations, applies to
the construction, modification, operation or maintenance of both

Drainage Plan Requirements
§ 296-16. General requirements. [Amended 3-16-2005 by Ord. No.
811; 6-15-2005 by Ord. No. 813]
For any of the regulated activities of this chapter, prior to the final approval
of subdivision and/or land development plans, or the issuance of any permit,
or the commencement of any land disturbance activity, the owner,
subdivider, developer or his agent shall submit a drainage plan for approval.
§ 296-17. Exemptions. [Amended 3-16-2005 by Ord. No. 811;
6-15-2005 by Ord. No. 813; 4-18-2007 by Ord. No. 855]
A. Impervious cover. Any proposed regulated activity, except those defined
in § 296-5D(5) and (6), which would create 10,000 square feet or less of
additional impervious cover is exempt from the drainage plan
preparation provisions of this chapter. All of the impervious cover
added incrementally to a site above the initial 10,000 square feet shall
be subject to the drainage plan preparation provisions of this chapter. If
a site has previously received an exemption and is proposing additional
development such that the total impervious cover on the site exceeds
10,000 square feet, the total impervious cover on the site proposed
since the original ordinance date must meet the provisions of this
chapter.
(1) The date of the Township ordinance adoption of the original Act
167 Stormwater Management Ordinance shall be the starting point
from which to consider tracts as "parent tracts" in which future
subdivisions and respective impervious area computations shall be
cumulatively considered. Predevelopment impervious cover is that
which is in place as of May 18, 1989, within the Little Lehigh Creek
Watershed, March 17, 1993, within the Jordan Creek Watershed,
and March 1, 1995, within the Coplay Creek Watershed. These
dates reflect the original ordinance adoption date in each
watershed.
(2) For development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with these criteria.
(3) Additional impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to,
additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages, driveways,
storage sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or driveway
areas and any new streets and sidewalks constructed as part of or
for the proposed regulated activity.
(4) Any additional areas proposed to initially be gravel, crushed stone,
porous pavement, etc., shall be assumed to be impervious for the
purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria. Any existing
gravel, crushed stone or hard packed soil areas on a site shall be

1:541
§ 296-18. Drainage plan contents. [Amended 3-16-2005 by Ord. No.
811; 6-15-2005 by Ord. No. 813]
The following items shall be included in the drainage plan:
considered as previous cover for the purpose of exemption
evaluation.
B. Prior drainage plan approval. Any regulated activity for which a
drainage plan was previously prepared as part of a subdivision or land
development proposal that received preliminary plan approval from the
municipality prior to the effective date of this chapter is exempt from
the drainage plan preparation provisions of this chapter, except as cited
in Subsection C, provided that the approved drainage plan included
design of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site currently
proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance provisions
in effect at the time of approval and the approval has not lapsed under
the Municipalities Planning Code. If significant revisions are made to
the drainage plan after both the preliminary plan approval and the
effective date of this chapter, preparation of a new drainage plan,
subject to the provisions of this chapter, shall be required. Significant
revisions would include a change in control methods or techniques,
relocation or redesign of control measures or changes necessary
because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the original
drainage plan.
C. These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing
such measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, property and
state water quality requirements. These measures include adequate
and safe conveyance of stormwater on the site and as it leaves the site.
These exemptions do not relieve the applicant from the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
D. No exemptions shall be provided for regulated activities as defined in
§ 296-5D(5) and (6).

site which involves a change in control methods or techniques, or which
involves the relocation or redesign of control measures or which is
necessary because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the drainage
plan (as determined by the Township Engineer) shall require a resubmission
of the modified drainage plan consistent with § 296-19 subject to review per
§ 296-20 of this chapter.
§ 296-22. Hardship waiver procedure. [Amended 3-16-2005 by Ord.
No. 811; 6-15-2005 by Ord. No. 813214]
D. Earthmoving for all regulated activities under § 296-5D shall be
conducted in accordance with the current federal and state regulations
relative to the NPDES and DEP Chapter 102 regulations.
A. The Township Engineer shall review the drainage plan, including the
BMP operations and maintenance plan, for consistency with the
adopted stormwater management plan as embodied by this chapter and
with any permits issued by DEP. The Township Engineer shall also
review the drainage plan against any additional storm drainage
provisions contained in the Township Subdivision and Land
Development, Chapter 312 or Chapter 350, Zoning , as applicable.
B. The Township shall not approve any subdivision or land development
[regulated activities § 296-5D(1) and (2)] or building permit application
[regulated activities § 296-5D(3) and (4)] if the drainage plan has been
found to be inconsistent with the stormwater management plan as
determined by the Township Engineer.
C. The Township shall notify the applicant in writing whether the drainage
plan, including the BMP operations and maintenance plan, is approved.
[Amended 4-18-2007 by Ord. No. 855]
D. The Township may require an as-built survey of all stormwater BMPs
and an explanation of any discrepancies with the drainage plan.
A. The Township may hear requests for waivers where it is alleged that the
provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The waiver request shall be in writing and accompanied by
the requisite fee based upon a fee schedule adopted by the Township
Board of Commissioners. A copy of the waiver request shall be provided
to each of the following: Township Manager, Township Zoning Hearing
Board, Township Engineer, Director of Community Development,
214. Editor’s Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 296-19 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 296-22
1:546
Township Solicitor and Lehigh Valley Planning Commission. The
request shall fully document the nature of the alleged hardship.
B. The Township may grant a waiver, provided, that all of the following
findings are made in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this chapter in the stormwater
management district in which the property is located;
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter, including the no
harm provision, and that the authorization of a waiver is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant; and
(4) That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum waiver
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue;
(5) That financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a hardship
waiver.
C. In granting any waiver, the Township Board of Commissioners or
Zoning Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
article. Such conditions may include, but not be limited to (if
recommended by the Township Engineer), a requirement that
comparable detention be located by the applicant on lands other than
those on which the waiver has been requested, to assure that the
overall detention capability of a given subarea is not diminished and
that the overall rate of runoff is not increased as a result of the waiver.

Maintenance Responsibilities for Permanent Stormwater Runoff
Controls
§ 296-26. Maintenance responsibilities. [Amended 3-16-2005 by
Ord. No. 811; 6-15-2005 by Ord. No. 813]
The maintenance responsibilities for permanent stormwater runoff control
facilities shall be determined based upon the type of ownership of the
property which is controlled by the facilities.
A. Single entity ownership. In all cases where the permanent stormwater
runoff control facilities are designed to manage runoff from property in
a single entity ownership as defined below, the maintenance
responsibility for the stormwater control facilities shall be with the
single entity owner. The single entity owner shall enter into an
agreement with the Township which specifies that the owner will
properly maintain the facilities consistent with accepted practice as
determined by the Township Engineer. The agreement shall provide for
regular inspections by the Township, shall contain such provisions as
are necessary to ensure timely correction of any maintenance
deficiencies by the single entity owner, and shall be recorded in the
miscellaneous docket in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Lehigh
County, Pennsylvania. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "single
entity" shall be defined as an individual, association, public or private
corporation, partnership firm, trust, estate or any other legal entity
empowered to own real estate.
B. Multiple ownership. In cases where the property controlled by the
permanent stormwater control facilities shall be in multiple ownership
(i.e., many individual owners of various portions of the property), the
developer shall dedicate the permanent stormwater control facilities to
the Township for maintenance unless, in the opinion of the Board of
Commissioners, another ownership and maintenance alternative, as
permitted in Subsection C, below, will better serve the public interest.
The developer shall pay a fee to the Township corresponding to the
present worth of maintenance of the facilities in perpetuity. The
estimated annual maintenance cost for the facilities shall be based on a
fee schedule provided by the Township Engineer and adopted by the
Township Board of Commissioners. The fee schedule must be
reasonable.
C. In certain multiple ownership situations, the public may benefit should
the Township require that maintenance responsibilities be borne by an
individual or other legal entity. In these instances, the Township and the
responsible individual or entity shall, at the Township's opinion, enter
into a formal agreement regarding such maintenance obligation.

from the Township for each separate street opening or street occupancy;
however, any person maintaining pipe, lines, or other underground facilities
in or under the surface of any street may proceed with a street opening

not reasonably and practically have been obtained beforehand. The person

prior to such openings. The permit fees, performance escrow amounts and
inspection escrow amounts for street excavations and street occupancies
shall be as listed in the Township's fee schedule, which may be updated
by resolution of the Board of Commissioners from time to time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, entities under contract with or performing
work for the Township or the Township's Municipal Authority are required
to obtain a permit under this article; however, no fee is required for such a
permit. Permit fees are not subject to a partial refund or any reimbursement
of funds or deposits in the event the applicant does not timely pick up
a permit following review by the Township. Following the Township's
notification to the applicant that a permit has been reviewed, has been
approved (effective upon being picked up) and is ready to be picked up
at the Township's office, the permit shall be valid for the period of time
established by resolution of the Board of Commissioners, which may be

work authorized by such permit or any work greater than that specified
in the permit, except that upon approval by the Inspector. Additional work
beyond that originally authorized by the permit may only be performed
under the provisions of the permit in such an amount as the Inspector
shall deem appropriate and necessary to complete the work. Any inspection
escrow amount and security posted in connection with the original permit
shall be deemed to cover any such additional work as may be approved
pursuant to this section. Upon request of the Township, the permittee shall
so acknowledge the applicability of the inspection escrow and security to
the additional work. If the scope of the work would require additional
security or an addition to the inspection escrow, the additional security
or inspection escrow funds shall be provided to the Township before the
additional scope of work approved by the Inspector commences.
§ 304-16. Commencement, performance, and completion of work.
A. Work for which a permit has been issued shall be completed within 120
days after the issuance of the permit unless otherwise specified in
writing by the Township. If not so completed, the permit shall be
automatically terminated unless the permittee applies to the Township
for an extension of time within which to perform the work. If such an
extension is granted, the original permit shall remain in force for the
period of time specified in the extension. The permittee shall notify the
Township Public Works Department and the Inspector 48 hours prior to
the initial commencement of work and prior to subsequent starts of
work.

work shall not be made in any place other than the location specifically
designated in the permit.
§ 304-18. Expiration of permits.
Every permit shall expire at the time stated in the permit. If the permittee
does not complete the work within the specified time, the permittee shall, at
least two business days prior to expiration of the permit, present in writing
to the Township a request for an extension of time, setting forth therein
the reasons for the requested extension. If in the opinion of the Township
such an extension is necessary and not contrary to the public interest, the
permittee may be granted additional time for the completion of the work.
In the event that the Township does not agree to an extension of the time
to complete the work, the permit shall expire, and the Township's rights
and remedies shall be as outlined in this article, including but not limited to
those in § 304-22 concerning revocation of permits and § 304-25 concerning
default by the permittee.
§ 304-19. Municipal utility work.
All street excavation or construction work required by utilities owned and/
or operated by the Township shall be made and restored under the direction
and supervision of the Inspector. The permit, permit fee, inspection escrow
and security requirements of this article shall not be applicable to any
openings or occupancies made by such municipally owned and/or operated
utilities.

written permission is obtained in advance from the Inspector. No work
shall be performed on any Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday except in
case of an emergency. If a street opening or excavation is left at any
incomplete stage for over 24 hours, it may be deemed contrary to the
public interest by the Township and be subject to the Township's rights
and remedies outlined in this article, including but not limited to those
in § 304-22, concerning revocation of permits.

delivery thereof to the person to be notified, by certified or registered
United States Mail addressed to the persons to be notified with return

deposited with a nationally recognized overnight courier.
C. When any street opening permit has been revoked or the Township does

thereby incurred by the Township shall be recovered from the
permittee, including but not limited to the Township's attorneys' and
experts' fees. The Township shall have the absolute right to draw on the
permittee's security for all expenses incurred in restoring the street or
part thereof under section.
A. It shall be the duty and responsibility of any applicant to:
(1) Make written application for the issuance of a street opening or
street occupancy permit to the Township upon the form(s)
furnished by the Township for that purpose and deliver all other
information required by said form(s) to be furnished to the
Township. The application shall be completed and signed by the
applicant, and all fees shall be paid when the permit application is
delivered to the Township.
(2) Make certain no work commences until i) the Township has
approved the application and plan and has issued a permit, ii) the
permittee has paid and provided all inspection escrow fees,
security and evidence of insurance as required by this article, and
iii) the permittee has notified the Township Public Works
Department and the Inspector of the time work is to commence
pursuant to the requirements of this article.
B. By submitting a permit application and picking up an approved permit,
all applicants shall have agreed to exonerate, indemnify, protect, defend
(through legal counsel of the Township's choice) and save harmless the
Township and its boards, committees and commissions (including the
individual members thereof), their elected and appointed officers and
officials and their employees, contractors, other professional
consultants, engineers, solicitors, managers, representatives,
inspectors, advisors, predecessors, successors, agents, independent
contractors, insurers and assigns (collectively, the "Township
representatives") from any and all claims, cross-claims, lawsuits,
proceedings, actions, causes and rights of action, expenses,
assessments, awards, attachments, losses, allegations, demands,
injuries, losses, costs (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and
other costs and expenses incurred, including expert witness fees),
damages (including, without limitation, compensatory, consequential or
punitive damages), sanctions, and liabilities of every kind, character
and manner whatsoever, in law or in equity, civil or criminal,
administrative or judicial, contract, tort (including, without limitation,
negligence of any kind) or otherwise ("claims"), pertaining to, relating
to, resulting from, caused by or arising out of: i) the design,
construction (including but not limited to materials and workmanship)
or operation of the improvements within the street, including but not
limited to any alleged negligence of the Township or Township
representatives, for damages or injuries, including death, to person or

§ 304-24. Duties and responsibilities of permittees.
properties pertaining to, relating to, resulting from, caused by, arising
out of or sustained in connection with the design, construction or
operation of the improvements within the street; ii) the failure of the
applicant or applicant's agents, contractors, employees, heirs,
executors, representatives, successors and assigns to comply with the
terms of the permit for construction of the improvements; and/or iii)
defects in materials and/or workmanship or for or on account of any
accident or other act, negligent or otherwise, or omission of the
applicant or his/her/its agents, servants, consultants, independent
contractors or employees.
C. In requesting a street opening, the applicant shall indicate justification
for installing facilities aboveground in any Township right-of-way, since
it is the intention of the Township to encourage the installation of
underground utilities.
A. Street openings. It shall be the duty and responsibility of any person
receiving a street right-of-way permit to:
(1) Pay the inspection escrow fee which shall be listed in the Township
fee schedule as updated from time to time by resolution of the
South Whitehall Township Board of Commissioners; provided,
however, that public utility companies and municipal authorities
may, upon written request to the Township, which request is
approved by the Township in writing in the Township's sole
discretion, elect to be billed monthly for such fees as they accrue in
a single invoice for all such permits that may be open at the
particular time instead of requiring independent inspection escrow
amounts for each individual permit.
(2) Make a deposit into an inspection escrow account to cover the cost
of inspecting the work authorized by the permit. The deposit to be
made by the permittee shall be in accordance with the amount
listed in the then-current Township fee schedule, as updated from
time to time by resolution of the South Whitehall Township Board of
Commissioners. The deposit shall be paid at the time the permit is
issued to the permittee, and the deposit shall be used to reimburse
the Township for the cost to cover all necessary inspection of said
work, the cost of restoration, or for any other purpose set forth in
this article. The Township may elect to waive this requirement, in
the Township's sole discretion, insofar as it pertains to a public
utility company, if such company submits a written request of the
waiver to the Township which is approved in writing by the
Township and such public utility company files with the Township
security satisfactory with the Township Solicitor in an amount
necessary to cover the required security and inspection escrow
amounts, conditioned upon the payment to the Township of all costs
which would otherwise be covered by and paid out of such
inspection escrow. In the event any public utility company elects to
§ 304-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 304-24
1:577
file such security, the Township shall bill such company monthly for
such costs as they accrue, and all such invoices shall be due within
30 days.
(a) Upon the Township forwarding the permittee an invoice for
Township expenses incurred during observation and inspection
of the work, the Township is authorized and shall have the
unilateral right to withdraw monies from the inspection escrow
to cover the Township expenses set forth in the invoice. The
permittee shall replenish the inspection escrow by promptly
paying the invoice. Said payment will be deposited into the
inspection escrow account. Any invoices not paid within 30
days of the invoice date shall incur a finance charge of 1% per
month, compounded monthly, until such sums have been paid.
If at any time the inspection escrow account is insufficient to
cover all or any part of an invoice for Township expenses, and
the Township informs the permittee of this fact, the Township
shall have the unilateral right to withdraw the remaining
monies from the inspection escrow account, and the permittee
shall pay Township the amount of any such shortfall and also
make a payment for the total invoice whereby said monies will
be deposited in the inspection escrow account. The permittee's
obligation to pay invoices for which there are insufficient funds
in the inspection escrow account is in addition to the
permittee's obligation to replenish the inspection escrow
account balance in accordance with this section. If an
inspection escrow account remains unfunded after 30 days, the
Township shall have the right to i) deny issuing additional
permits to the permittee for other proposed openings or
occupancies; ii) stop all inspections under permits then-issued,
and/or iii) issue an order that the permittee cease and desist all
work until all outstanding invoices are paid and the inspection
escrow account is replenished as required by this article.
(3) When the permit is issued, the permittee shall provide the
Township with security to guarantee faithful performance of the
work authorized by a permit granted pursuant to this article. The
amount of the security shall be as established in the Township fee
schedule adopted by resolution of the Board of Commissioners. The
term of the security shall begin from the date of the permit being
issued and shall not expire until 18 months following the
permanent restoration of the pavement as evidenced by the receipt
of a certificate of final inspection from the Inspector. If the
permittee anticipates requesting more than one permit per year as
required by this article, the permittee may furnish one letter of
credit or cash escrow account in such amount as the Township
deems necessary to guarantee faithful performance, but such
amount shall be no less than the aggregate sum of the security for
each project individually.
§ 304-24 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 304-24
1:578
(4) Insurance:
(a) Provide the Township with evidence that the following
insurance coverage is in place, indicating that the permittee,
the Township and the Township representatives are insured
against claims for damages for personal injury as well as
against claims for property damages which may arise from or
out of the performance of the work, whether such performance
be by the permittee, its subcontractor, or anyone directly or
indirectly employed by the permittee. The permittee shall
provide copies of its liability insurance policy and
endorsement(s) for the coverage of Township and Township
representatives and the declaration page(s) by which the
Township and the Township representatives are named as
additional insureds and that the requirements of this article
are complied with. Insurance binders shall also be acceptable
in lieu of providing the actual policies and endorsement(s).
This information shall be delivered to the Township for review
when the permit application is delivered to the Township.
Evidence of the renewal of each such policy shall be provided
to the Township for a permit to be valid. Such insurance shall
cover all manner of liability, including but not limited to
collapse, explosion hazards, and underground work by
equipment of the street, and shall include protection against
liability arising from completed operations.
[1] Commercial general liability (includes bodily injury and
property damage): limit $1,000,000 per occurrence;
$2,000,000 in the aggregate, with the Township listed as
additional insured on a primary noncontributory basis;
explosion/collapse not excluded.
[2] Commercial automobile liability: $1,000,000 combined
single limit, with the Township listed as additional insured
on a primary noncontributory basis.
[3] Workers compensation limit per statue; employers
liability: $1,000,000, all three parts; waiver of subrogation
in favor of the Township from the policyholder.
[4] Excess or umbrella liability: $2,000,000; form follows
overall coverage shown above and contains no additional
exclusions.
(b) A public utility company or municipal authority may be
relieved of the obligation of submitting such evidence of
insurance if it submits satisfactory evidence that said company
or authority and the Township and Township representatives
are insured or it has adequate provision for self-insurance of
itself, the Township and the Township representatives in
accordance with the requirements of this article. Evidence of
§ 304-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 304-24
1:579
§ 304-25. Default in performance.
Whenever the Inspector shall find that a default has occurred in the
performance of any term or condition of the permit, including failure to
complete the work within the time granted by the permit, written notice
thereof shall be given to the permittee. Such notice shall state the work to
be done and the period of time deemed by the Inspector to be reasonably
necessary for the completion of the work. After receipt of such notice, the
permittee must, within the time therein specified, cause the required work
to be performed. Failure to complete this work by the specified date will
subject the permittee to the default and remedy provisions of this article. In
the event that the default has created a condition that the Inspector deems
to be a threat to the public health, safety or welfare, including a condition
of an emergency nature, no notice must be provided of the default, and
self-insurance shall be acceptable to the Township Solicitor.
Public utilities and authorities may submit annually such
evidence of insurance coverage in lieu of individual
submissions for each permit.
B. Street occupancy. It shall be the duty and responsibility of any person
receiving an issued street right-of-way permit to:
(1) Pay all required fees and inspection escrows and provide security
as listed in the Township fee schedule and as updated from time to
time by resolution of the South Whitehall Township Board of
Commissioners.
(2) Post the permit and an approved copy of the plan in full view of the
public at all times while such work is in progress at the location for
which said permit was granted.
C. Indemnification. All permittees shall be deemed to have agreed to
exonerate, indemnify, protect, defend (through legal counsel of the
Township's choice) and save harmless the Township and the Township
representatives from any and all claims pertaining to, relating to,
resulting from, caused by or arising out of: i) the design, construction
(including but not limited to materials and workmanship) or operation
of the improvements within the street, including but not limited to any
alleged negligence of the Township or Township representatives, for
damages or injuries, including death, to person or properties pertaining
to, relating to, resulting from, caused by, arising out of or sustained in
connection with the design, construction or operation of the
improvements within the street; ii) the failure of the applicant or
applicant's agents, contractors, employees, heirs, executors,
representatives, successors and assigns to comply with the terms of the
permit for construction of the improvements; and/or iii) defects in
materials and/or workmanship or for or on account of any accident or
other act, negligent or otherwise, or omission of the applicant or his/
her/its agents, servants, consultants, independent contractors or
employees.
§ 304-24 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 304-25
1:580
the Township shall have the right to exercise all available remedies without
first having provided written notice. The Township shall have the absolute
right to draw on the permittee's security for all expenses incurred in curing
a default of a permittee, including but not limited to restoring the street
(including restoration during a post-completion maintenance period) and all
costs and expenses of attorneys and experts retained by the Township.
§ 304-26. Restrictions upon opening new streets.
No permit shall be issued by the Township which would allow an excavation
or opening in a paved and improved street surface less than five years old
unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate that public health or safety
require that the proposed work be permitted or an emergency condition
exists. This section applies to any street that has received a surface
treatment within the previous five-year period, including but not limited
to top coat paving and chipping and sealing. For new roads dedicated to
the Township, the five-year period begins from the point of the Township's
formal acceptance of the road following expiration of the applicable
maintenance period. The Township Board of Commissioners shall have the
right, but in no event any obligation, to grant exceptions to this section
for nonemergency situations following receipt of a written request from an
applicant outlining the justification for the requested exemption.
§ 304-27. Additional payments for opening new streets.
If a permit is issued to open any paved and improved street surface less than
five years old, an additional payment shall be made for the opening, except
that the payment shall be waived in the event the work is of an emergency
nature. The additional payment shall be equal to the greater of $250 or 2%
of all the total cost of restoring the opening for each unelapsed month or
fraction thereof of the five-year restricted period.
§ 304-28. Emergency excavations.
In case of an emergency arising at night, Saturday, Sunday, legal holidays
or at such times as the office of the Township is closed and an immediate
excavation may be necessary for the protection of public or private property,
or life, the same shall be made upon the express condition that a permit
application required by this article be made to the Township with a copy to
the Township Public Works Department on or before 12:00 noon of the next
business day.
§ 304-29. Permits revocable.
Each permit granted hereunder constitutes a revocable permission to
occupy or to open a Township right-of-way. By accepting a permit, each
permittee agrees that if it becomes necessary to construct, reconstruct,
maintain, change the grade of or otherwise alter the existing street, curb,
sidewalk or access in such a manner that removal or relocation of the
§ 304-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 304-29
1:581
utility facilities, curb cut, crossover or access is required, such removal or
relocation must be made by the permittee at his own expense.
§ 304-30. Street list requirements.
Every person owning, using, controlling or having an interest in pipes,
conduits, ducts or other structures under the surface of any street used
for the purpose of supplying or conveying gas, electricity, communication
signals (including television cable, Internet, fiber optic and telephone),
sanitary sewerage, water or steam to or from the Township or to or from
its inhabitants, or for any other purposes, shall file with the Township
within 120 days after the adoption of this article plans or "as built prints"
containing the names of the Township's streets wherein the aforementioned
facilities owned by such a person are located. The presented prints shall
show the location and depth of existing facilities.
§ 304-31. Abandoned facilities.
§ 304-32. Street right-of-way/easement permit notices.
A. Whenever any pipe, conduit, duct, tunnel, or other structure located
under the surface of any street, or the use thereof, is abandoned, the
person owning, using, controlling or having an interest therein shall,
within 30 days after such abandonment, file with the Township a
statement in writing giving in detail the location of the structure so
abandoned.
B. Whenever there are manholes or tunnels associated with abandoned
underground facilities, such manholes or tunnels shall be filled in at the
time of abandonment and the Township notified thereof in writing.
C. When the Township plans to pave or improve streets in which there are
abandoned facilities, the owners of such facilities shall be required to
remove them if in the opinion of the Township their removal is in the
best interest of the Township. If the owner shall refuse to remove such
facilities, the Township shall remove the abandoned facilities, and the
owner shall reimburse the Township for such removal.
A. If the work to be undertaken by the permittee, including private
contractors, is such that it will affect the use of properties abutting or
adjoining the project, the permittee shall notify the affected property
owners and/or tenants of the proposed work to be done. This notice
shall be given not less than 48 hours prior to the start of work.
B. If the work to be undertaken by a permittee will affect other subsurface
installations in the vicinity of the proposed opening or occupancy, the
permittee shall notify the owners of such facilities of the proposed
work.

review period set by applicable law for decisionmaking. Failure of
the Planning Commission to communicate its recommendations to
the Board of Commissioners within the prescribed time frame shall
not affect the status of the preliminary plan application nor cause
any extension of the applicable review period.
E. Township Board of Commissioners action. The Township Board of
Commissioners shall review the recommendations of the Township
Planning Commission and shall act on the preliminary plan, stating its
approval, conditional approval, or disapproval, giving reasons for each
within the time period set by applicable law for decisionmaking. This
time may be extended if the applicant grants an extension of time to the
Township.
(1) The decision of the Board of Commissioners shall be in writing and
shall be communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him
at his last known address not later than 15 days following the date
of the decision.
(a) When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the
decision shall specify the defect found in the application and
describe the requirements which have not been met and shall,
in each case, cite the provisions of the statute, ordinance,
resolution, regulation and/or policy relied upon.
(b) When the application is proposed to be approved with
conditions, prior to the meeting at which the Board of
Commissioners will take action on the preliminary plan
application, the Township shall advise the applicant of the
proposed conditions to such approval. Before the Board of
Commissioners takes action on the preliminary plan
application, the applicant shall either a) execute the
acceptance of conditions form as presented by the Township
indicating the applicant's acceptance of all proposed
conditions or b) indicate in writing that the conditions are not
acceptable and specifically identify which conditions are not
acceptable to the applicant.
(2) The Board of Commissioners may, based on a recommendation
from the Planning Commission, consider the preliminary plan a
final plan.
F. Nature of approval by Township Board of Commissioners. If the
Township Board of Commissioners does not waive the submission of a
final plan for the subdivision, approval of the preliminary plan shall not
constitute approval of a final plan, but rather an expression of approval
§ 312-11 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 312-11
1:614
§ 312-12. Preliminary plan: submission and drawing requirements.
of the layout submitted and the staging of development, as shown on
the preliminary plan as a guide for the preparation of a final plan.

municipal collection and/or disposal systems to the proposed
site is deemed to be economically impractical by the Board of
Commissioners, the applicant shall be required to construct a
sanitary sewage collector system and treatment plant to
Township or its designee's standards, for connection to the
municipal system if and when constructed to serve the
development, and offer to dedicate said system to the Township
or its designee without cost, as a central public sanitary sewer
collection system. If a sanitary sewage disposal system is
required, the Township, at its discretion, may require that the
applicant construct the disposal system, or that said system be
constructed by the Township and/or the South Whitehall
Township Authority.227 When the subdivision requires a new
central sewage collection and/or disposal system, the applicant
shall, if required, apply for and obtain a permit from the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and a
letter from the applicant which states that he will comply with

plan, the resolution approving the project and/or the
agreements.
(7) That the developer, before any permit is issued to the developer
and before the developer or any of its agents enters upon the
property to conduct any earthmoving activities or construction
activities or perform any other site improvement activities, the
developer shall carry insurance coverage in amounts and with
companies acceptable to the Township Solicitor, consistent with the
Township's policy concerning insurance coverage as may be
adopted from time to time by resolution of the Board of
Commissioners. Such insurance shall include, at a minimum,
commercial general liability insurance, workers' compensation and
employers' liability insurance and commercial motor vehicle
insurance coverage.
B. The form and type of financial security shall be approved by the
Township Solicitor and shall be consistent with the Township's policy
concerning financial security as may be adopted from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Commissioners. Such financial security shall
be posted with a bonding company or federal or commonwealth
chartered lending institution chosen by the developer posting the
financial security, provided that the bonding company or lending
institution is authorized to conduct business within the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania.
C. The amount of financial security to be posted for completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
of the required improvements based upon the Township's cost to
construct and install the improvements (including prevailing wage
rates), estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer, plus an additional 10% for contingencies
above the estimated hard costs, the estimated cost to prepare the asbuilt
plans required by these regulations and any fees which are to be
paid to the Township following recording of the plan, such as recreation
fees, capital improvements fees, highway capital improvements fees,
§ 312-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 312-27
1:655
etc., which are not paid prior to recording of the plan. The cost estimate
also includes a separate line item for the estimated inspection fees of
the Township Engineer inspecting the improvements. The estimated
cost of completion of the required improvements shall be submitted
by the developer for review and approval by the Township Engineer
and prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and documented to the satisfaction of
the Township Engineer by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable
estimate of such cost. Upon the recommendation of the Township
Engineer based on his/her review, the Township may refuse to accept
such estimate. If the developer and the Township are unable to agree
upon an estimate, the procedures set forth in the Section 509(g) of
the MPC244 shall be followed. No final plan shall be approved until
the estimated scheduled date for subdivision or land development
construction completion is explicitly set forth on its cover sheet.
D. If the developer requires more than one year from the date of posting of
the financial security to complete the required improvements, the
Township may require that the amount of financial security be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements, based upon the Township's cost to construct and install
the improvements (including prevailing wage rates), as re-established
on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the
above procedure for estimating the cost of completion of the required
improvements.
E. Phasing of development. In the case where development is projected
over a period of years, the final plan may be prepared and submitted for
an initial stage of development or for subsequent stages of
development, provided that such stages of development had been
approved by the Township Board of Commissioners as part of the
preliminary plan. Final plan approval of each stage or section is subject
to all provisions of § 312-27. The Township may require guarantees for
specific improvements in future stages or sections if the Township finds
their completion essential for the protection of any finally approved
stage of the development.
F. Where the Township accepts dedication of all or some of the required
improvements following satisfactory completion on the basis of review
and recommendation by the Township Engineer, the Township may
require the posting of additional financial security to secure the
structural integrity of the improvements as well as the functioning of
said improvements in accordance with the design and specifications in
the final plan for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of
acceptance of dedication, with the exception of shade/street trees for
which the financial security shall not exceed 24 months. The amount of

§ 312-28. Construction observation.
The installation of all improvements to be dedicated to South Whitehall
Township or South Whitehall Township Authority,245 or related to drainage
and similar improvements determined by the Township in the direct interest
of the Township shall be subject to observation by the Township Engineer
and Township staff to check for satisfactory completion and maintenance.
If such observation reveals that work is not in accordance with approved
plans, specifications and/or these regulations, that construction is not being
done in a good, workman-like manner, or that erosion and sediment controls
are failing to prevent acceleration erosion or waterborne sediment from
leaving the site of construction, the Township Engineer or Township staff
shall immediately notify the Manager of the Community Development
Department of the violations or infractions. The Township is empowered to
require corrections to be made and/or order the suspension of subdivision
approval and to issue a cease-and-desist order, which may include any
this additional financial security shall be equal to 15% of the actual cost
of installation of the improvements. The eighteen-month maintenance
period (24 months for shade/street trees) shall not begin until the
final inspection, approval and, where applicable, acceptance by the
Township of all improvements required by these regulations and other
applicable Township ordinances, rules, regulations, resolutions, etc.,
within the subdivision and/or land development.
G. Where adequate financial security has been provided as set forth above,
the Township shall not unreasonably withhold the issuance of building,
grading or other permits relating to the construction of the
improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted on
the final plan. Moreover, where adequate financial security has been
provided and the developer complies with § 312-26B, occupancy
permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld
following the Township Engineer's certification provided in accordance
with § 312-28C herein.
H. If the developer desires to begin construction of the improvements
prior to recording the final plan, signing the necessary agreement(s)
and posting the required security, the developer shall sign a presecurity
construction agreement in the form prepared by the Township
Solicitor which provides, among other things, for the developer's
responsibility for all observation costs incurred by the Township while
observing the developer's construction of the improvements, insurance
and indemnification as required by § 312-27A(6) and (7) and an
acknowledgment by the developer that it agrees that it is proceeding at
its own risk if it proceeds to perform work with respect to any
governmental approvals and permits it must still obtain, including, but
not limited to, any permits which the applicant must obtain from
PennDOT.

Commissioners in writing periodically as to the status of construction and as
to the status of any maintenance or bonding responsibilities which extend
beyond the completion date for any subdivision and/or land development.
A. The cost of all legal services for the negotiations, preparation,
modification or review of any legal agreements relating to a
subdivision, whether finally approved or not, and all costs of
engineering, including but not limited to field observations, will be paid
to the Township by the developer to reimburse the Township for the
services of the Township Engineer and Solicitor.
B. In no case shall any Township road or facility paving work be done
without permission from the Township Engineer. At least three working
days' notice shall be given to the Township Engineer prior to any such
construction, so that a representative of the Township Engineer may be
present at the time the work is to be done.

Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reasons for such
nonapproval or rejection.
(5) The Board of Commissioners shall notify the developer, in writing,
by certified or registered mail, of their action with relation thereto.
(6) If the Board of Commissioners or Township Engineer fails to
comply with the time limitation condition contained herein, all
improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the
developer shall be released from all liability pursuant to its
agreement relative to construction and installation of the
improvements contained in the developer's request, but not any
agreement relative to the correction, remedy, repair,
refurbishment, reconstruction, reinstallation, maintenance,
replacement and performance of such maintenance to the
improvements as may be necessary.
(7) If any portion of the said improvements shall not be improved or
shall be rejected by the Board of Commissioners, the developer
shall proceed to complete the same, and upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
F. Maintenance inspection. A maintenance inspection of all the required
improvements will be made by the Township Engineer and Township
staff to determine whether the improvements have been constructed to
acceptable standards of workmanship, with acceptable materials and
maintained to withstand reasonable use.
(1) The maintenance inspection shall take place no sooner than 14

approved by the Township Engineer, the commencement of the
maintenance period shall be delayed until all of the required
improvements identified in the agreement relative to construction and
installation of the improvements have been approved as complete by
the Township Engineer and Township staff unless the project is phased.
F. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
developer may request that the Township release, from time to time,
such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor performing the work. Any such request shall be in writing,
addressed to the Township, and the Township shall have 45 days from
receipt of such request within which to allow the Township Engineer to
provide written documentation to the Board of Commissioners that the
improvements have been completed in accordance with the approved
plan. This request by the developer shall include a list of quantities of
improvements installed as part of this specific request. If the Township
fails to act within the forty-five-day period, the Township shall be

including but not limited to roads and stormwater management facilities,
remain in private ownership, with the maintenance responsibility placed
on individual lot owners, a homeowners' association or similar entity, or
an organization capable of carrying out such maintenance responsibilities.
Prior to the release of the maintenance security by the Township, all
improvements, easements and rights-of-way which are to be dedicated to
the Township or Authority,246 as applicable, as shown on the final plan, shall
be dedicated to the Township by the delivery of a special warranty deed
or bill(s) of sale, as appropriate, conveying the same to the Township in
fee simple, plus the developer's attorney's opinion of record title pursuant
to § 312-27A(3) that the land conveyed is good and marketable and free of
all liens and encumbrances, or in such other manner recommended by the
Township Solicitor and approved by the Township Board of Commissioners.
§ 312-32. Failure to comply.
In addition to the remedies provided in Article VII for violations of this
chapter, the Township's rights in the event of a developer's default shall

§ 312-33. Sale or leasing of lots or space; erecting buildings.
The sale of lots in a subdivision, the leasing of space or lots in a subdivision,
the issuance of permits to erect, alter or repair any building upon land
in a subdivision, and the erection of a building in a subdivision shall be
permitted only in accordance with § 312-43.
A. Failure to comply with the requirements of inspection will be grounds
for revocation of the final approval until the developer has corrected
the defects, and constitutes a violation of this chapter, thereby
subjecting the developer to the penalties set forth in § 312-46. Failure
to obtain final inspection approval shall also be a basis for the
revocation of the approval of the final plan of the subdivision by the
Township Board of Commissioners, and shall be a basis for enforcing
the remedies under § 312-46, and for seeking recovery under the
performance security and/or maintenance security.
B. In the event that any required subdivision improvements have not been
installed or maintained as required by this chapter, by the agreements
between the Township and the developer or in accordance with the
approved final plat, the Township may enforce any performance
security and/or maintenance security by appropriate legal and
equitable remedies. If proceeds of such performance security and/or
maintenance security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or
making repairs or corrections to all of the required subdivision
improvements covered by said security, the Township may, at its option,
install, repair and/or correct part of such improvements in all or part of
the subdivision or land development and may institute appropriate legal
or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary to complete the
installation, repair or correction of the remainder of the improvements.
All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any
legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be
used solely for the installation, repair and/or correction of the
improvements covered by such security, and not for any other municipal
purpose.

permitted, and must be provided with a right-of-way at the
turnaround of fifty-two-foot radius or more and the curb
radius must be 40 feet or more. For purposes of this
chapter, a "cul-de-sac" means any street or portion thereof
which has only one point of access to another public road,
and which has a turnaround at any end thereof which does
not connect to another public road. Cul-de-sac streets shall
have a minimum length of 250 feet (subject to PennDOT's
recommendation to qualify for liquid fuels reimbursement)
and may not be longer than 400 feet, measured from the
point of the center line intersection between the cul-de-sac
street and the street which provides access to the rest of
the public road system, along the center line of the cul-desac,
to the place where the turnaround begins. In addition,
§ 312-35 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 312-35

no turnaround in a cul-de-sac may be longer, at its longest
diameter, than 120 feet. No cul-de-sac or cul-de-sac system
shall furnish access to more than 15 dwelling units,
including corner lots, whether or not they face on the
cul-de-sac street. Where one cul-de-sac street connects
with another street that has only one point of access with
another public road besides the first cul-de-sac, such as
a system diagrammed below, both streets shall be
considered to be one single cul-de-sac system. The length
of the cul-de-sac system shall be equal to the longest
length from the single point of access of the entire system
to the public road system to any turnaround. A snow
dropoff area shall be provided at the terminus of the
turnaround area. The snow dropoff area shall be 28 feet
wide and 20 feet deep from the street curbline. The snow
dropoff area shall be centered on the center line of the
street as the street approaches the turnaround area. The
snow dropoff area shall be contained in an easement and

§ 312-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 312-36
1:681
management facility (or the portion thereof which the
developer desires to have classified as "useful open
space") is designed so that it clearly would regularly
be accessible and usable for recreation during all
times except immediately following a ten-year storm
or a storm of greater intensity. Generally, stormwater
management facilities, including but not limited to
traditional, grass-bottomed stormwater detention
basins, shall not be permitted as useful open space.

important natural features (such as woodlands or
creek valleys) that might otherwise be disturbed or
adversely affected;
[g] Whether the area will involve a significant
concentration of residents, especially in homes
without large yards;
[h] Whether it will be possible to combine common open
space on this tract with additional open spaces on an
adjacent tract, when that tract is developed in the
future; and
[i] Any other factor set forth in this § 312-36D(4), or
deemed relevant to the particular tract by the
Township.
[3] The Board of Commissioners may require that land to be
dedicated under this § 312-36D(4) be located along an
edge of the property so that it may, in the future, be
combined with an open space dedication on the edge of an
adjoining property when that adjoining property is
subdivided or developed, and/or so that it may be
combined with an existing adjacent open space dedicated
§ 312-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 312-36
1:683
for open space or recreation purposes. If the developer
owns one or more adjacent tracts that are not currently
proposed to be subdivided or developed (or is not
currently planning to develop all of the original tract being
subdivided), the developer shall provide a sketch of a
possible future land dedication on the adjacent lands (or
the undeveloped portion of the original tract) in the event
of future development.
[4] The developer shall state in his/her application those
improvements (if any) he/she intends to make to the land
proposed for dedication hereunder to make it suitable for
its intended purpose, such as rough grading, drainage
improvements, landscaping, clearance of undesirable
vegetation or development of trails. Such land shall be free
of construction debris, excavated materials and solid
waste prior to dedication.

construction documents (latest revision).
[2] Lawn areas shall be in accordance with the Township
standard construction documents (latest revision).
[3] Fencing shall be in accordance with the Township
standard construction documents (latest revision).
[4] Permanent monuments. Permanent concrete monuments
shall be placed in all locations where a change in
horizontal alignment occurs on the property line of the
land to be conveyed to the Township.
[5] Maintenance obligations. The maintenance obligations for
the said lands shall not be undertaken by the Township
until all of the requirements of this Subsection D(4)(d)
have been satisfied.

common open space if both the developer and the Board of
Commissioners agree. In any case where the developer
does not or cannot offer a sufficient amount of land for
common open space, the developer shall pay the
recreation fee in lieu of land dedication. Whenever fees are
permitted or required, the developer shall place a note on
the preliminary and final record plans stating that such
fees are required to be paid as part of the subdivision or
land development approval.
[2] Combination of land and fees. The Board of Commissioners
and the developer may agree on any combination of
common open space dedication and payment of recreation
fees, provided that the value of the combination to the
Township, its residents, and/or persons employed in the
Township is consistent with the requirements of this
§ 312-36D(4) when only land is dedicated or only fees are
paid.
§ 312-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 312-36
1:685
[3] Fees for residential subdivision or land development. The
amount of fees to be paid in lieu of common open space
land dedication in residential subdivision or land
development shall be $2,500 per dwelling unit, based upon
the maximum number of new dwelling units that would be
permitted to be constructed on the lots of the subdivision
or land development after the plan is approved.
[4] Fees for nonresidential subdivisions or developments. The
amount of fees to be paid in lieu of common open space
land dedication in nonresidential subdivisions or
developments shall be $0.25 per square foot of additional
proposed impervious coverage (post-development
impervious surface minus pre-development impervious
surface) in lieu of the requirement for public dedication of
land. Impervious coverage includes buildings, parking lots
and any other man-made impervious surface. Only a net
increase in impervious coverage will result in a fee to be
charged.
[5] Adjustment of fees. The Board of Commissioners may, from
time to time by resolution, adjust the fees set forth in
Subsection D(4)(g)[3] and [4].
(h) Use of fees.
[1] Any fees collected under this section shall be placed within
an interest-bearing account and shall be accounted for
separately from other Township funds.
[2] To ensure that the lands and facilities dedicated or
provided hereunder are accessible to the residents and
employees of the developments that paid fees toward their
cost, the Recreation Fee District Map, set forth in
Subsection D(4)(h)[5], designates two overlapping
recreation fee districts — the Western Recreation Fee
District and the Eastern Recreation Fee District. Except as
provided in Subsection D(4)(h)[4], all fees collected under
this § 312-36D(4) with respect to any given subdivision or
land development shall only be expended within that
(those) recreation fee district(s) which include all or part
of the subdivision or land development.
[3] Such fees shall only be used in accordance with the MPC.
Fees do not have to be spent on land acquired as part of a
combination of land and fees agreement.
[4] A portion of the fees for each subdivision or land
development may also be used for the acquisition and
development of centrally located park or recreation areas
providing programs and facilities for the entire Township.

(i) Timing of fees. Fees to be paid under this § 312-36D(4) in lieu
of common open space land dedication shall be paid prior to
the recording of the final plan, except as follows:
[1] If the required fee would be greater than $10,000, and the
developer and the Township mutually agree to provisions
in a binding development agreement to require the
payment of all applicable recreation fees prior to the
issuance of any building permits within each clearly
defined phase of the development, then the fees are not
required to be paid prior to recording of the final plan but
may instead be paid within the requirements of that
development agreement.
(j) Modifications to land dedication and fee requirements. The
Board of Commissioners may reduce the land dedication or fee
requirements of this § 312-36D(4) if the developer agrees to
undertake one or more of the following actions, provided that
the value of the combination of land, fees, and such actions to
the Township, its residents, and/or persons employed in the
Township, is consistent with the requirements of this
§ 312-36D(4) when only land is dedicated or only fees are paid:
[1] Construction of substantial permanent recreation facilities
within the proposed subdivision or land development and/
or existing public open space;
[2] Donation (or sale at a price below market value) of
appropriate land to the Township [or any other public
entity described in Subsection D(4)(f)] for public
recreation. In the case of a sale under this subsection, the
developer or land developer must provide evidence of the
fair market value of the property from qualified
professionals.

such actions as are required to manage the rate volume, direction and
quality of resulting stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise
adequately protects health and property from injury and damage."

alteration or development of land. By submitting an application under
the Township Stormwater Management Plan, the developer hereby
agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the municipality and

utilities located thereon, be unable to plant every required shade
tree as shown on the approved landscaping plan, the developer, in

unless and until a final subdivision plan has been approved and, where
required, recorded, and unless and until the improvements required by
the Township Board of Commissioners in connection therewith have either
been constructed or guaranteed as hereinabove provided. Where, owing to
special conditions, a literal enforcement of this provision would result in
unnecessary hardship, the Township Board of Commissioners may, in its
sole and absolute discretion, modify this requirement following referral to
and recommendation of the Planning Commission concerning the scope of
such reasonable exception thereto as will not be contrary to the public
interest, and may permit the sale of a lot, leasing of space, issuance of a

shall refer every proposed amendment originated by said Board to
the Township Planning Commission and the Lehigh Valley Planning
Commission. The Township Planning Commission shall have at
least 30 days prior to a public hearing scheduled to discuss the
amendment to submit to the Board of Commissioners a report
containing its recommendations, including any additions or
modifications to the original proposal, all as provided for in the
MPC.

permit, or erection of a building, subject to conditions necessary to assure
installation of adequate streets and other public improvements.
§ 312-44. Conflict of interest.
No person who is employed by the Township in any activity affected by
these regulations and no person on the staff of any firm, organization or
agency representing the Township on any matter which is affected by these
regulations shall represent a developer of a major subdivision within the
Township.
§ 312-45. Relationship to other provisions of law.
Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction than imposed or required
by such other provisions of law, ordinance, resolution, or regulation, or by
such easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of this chapter
shall control. Wherever the provisions of other law or ordinance or
regulations impose a greater restriction than this chapter, the provisions of
such other law or ordinance or regulations shall control.
§ 312-46. Violations and penalties.
A. Enforcement remedies. Any person who or which has violated the
provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor in a
civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township before a
Magisterial District Judge, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus
all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied, or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the Magisterial District Judge. If the defendant neither pays
nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the
judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day
that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless
the Magisterial District Judge determining that there has been a
violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
person, partnership or corporation violating the chapter to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the Magisterial
District Judge and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. The court of common pleas, upon
petition, may grant an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per
diem judgment pending a final adjudication of the violation and
judgment. Nothing contained in this Subsection A shall be construed or
interpreted to grant to any person or entity other than the Township the
right to commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this
subsection.

any parts of Township ordinances, resolutions and/or other regulations
are hereby repealed insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions
of this chapter. All other provisions of the ordinances, resolutions and/
or other regulations of the Township of South Whitehall, Lehigh County,
Pennsylvania, shall remain in full force and effect.

maintain appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain,
correct, or abate violations of this chapter, to prevent unlawful
construction, to recover damages, and to prevent illegal occupancy
of a building, structure, or premises. The description by metes and
bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in
the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or
transferor from such penalties or from the remedies herein
provided.
(2) Refusal to issue permit or grant approval.
(a) The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any
approval necessary to further improve or develop any real

of the following applicants:

such violation without regard as to whether such vendee
or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the
violation.
[3] The current owner of record who acquired the property
subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to
whether such current owner had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
[4] The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who
acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation

actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.

applicant acquired an interest in such real property.

A. If the literal enforcement of any provision of this chapter will exact
undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to applicants'
land or the nature of the application (such as, but not limited to, the
unique natural, historical, aesthetic or scenic character of the
subdivision), the Township may grant a modification or waiver in

plantings, or other landscaping/screening required by this chapter, the
Township may require alternate plantings or plantings at other
locations within the development.

for modifications or waivers.

conditions of approval of the plan and shall apply only to the

agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with

pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, Township, school
district or county of a tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax

cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and
child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister, and between a grandparent and
grandchild or the spouse of such grandchild, except that a
subsequent transfer by the grantee within one year shall be subject

which title is acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set
forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the
benefit of his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this
subsection.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,

repealed by a subsequent ordinance. This tax is in addition to all other taxes
of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the municipality.
§ 328-76. Exemptions.
The tax levied by § 328-75 shall not be imposed upon the following persons:
§ 328-77. Collection through employers.
A. Any person who served in any war or armed conflict in which the United
States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple
amputee or has a service-connected disability declared by the United
States Veterans' Administration or its successor to be a total, 100%
permanent disability.
B. Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
calendar year. For purposes of this subsection, "reserve component of
the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United
States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps Reserve, United
States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air Force Reserve, the
Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air National
Guard.
C. Any person whose total earned income and/or net profits from all
sources within the municipality is less than $12,000 for the calendar
year in which the local services tax is levied.
A. Every employer shall, within 15 days after first becoming an employer,
register with the collector the employer's name, address and such other
information as the collector may require. Failure to register in a timely
manner does not relieve the employer of the requirements of this
article.
B. As to each taxpayer employed for any length of time during any payroll
period of an employer during the calendar year, each employer shall
deduct a pro rata share of the tax from the earned income payable to
the taxpayer with respect to such payroll period. The pro rata share of
the tax assessed on a taxpayer for a payroll period shall be determined
by dividing the rate of the tax, $47 levied for the calendar year, by the
number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar
year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share of the tax, an
employer shall round down the amount of tax deducted for each payroll
period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar.
C. Each employer shall file a return on a form prescribed by the Collector,
and pay the Collector the full amount of all such taxes deducted during
a calendar quarter within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter.
§ 328-75 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 328-77
1:767
A tax return must be filed for each calendar quarter, regardless of
whether withholdings were completed or any tax liability exists.
D. Any employer who discontinues business or ceases operation during the
calendar year shall, within 15 days after discontinuing business or
ceasing operation, file the return hereinabove required and pay the tax
to the Collector.
E. The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the
employee from the duty to file a return and pay the tax. Any employer
who fails to deduct the tax as required by this section, or who fails to
pay such tax to the Collector, shall be liable for such tax in full, as
though the tax had originally been levied against such employer. No
employer shall be liable for failure to deduct the tax if the failure to
deduct the tax arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed.
F. Priority of withholding.
(1) The tax shall be withheld at the place of employment on the first
day the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll
period.
(2) In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, i.e.,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the
person working in more than one political subdivision during the
payroll period, the priority to withhold the local services tax shall
be in the following order:
(a) The political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed;
(b) The political subdivision in which the person resides and
works, if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(c) The political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
G. The employer shall not deduct the tax but shall maintain adequate
records concerning the employees in the cases described in Subsection
G(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) It is the intent of this section that no person shall be subject to the
payment of the local services tax in more than one municipality
during each payroll period. No taxpayer shall be required to pay
more than $47 in total during the calendar year. In the case of
concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the local services tax if the employee provides:
§ 328-77 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 328-77
1:768
(a) A recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes
the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and
the amount of local services tax withheld; and
(b) A statement from the employee that the pay statement is from
the employee's principal employer and the employee will notify
other employers of a change in principal place of employment
within two weeks of its occurrence.
(2) In the case of an employee claiming the exemption set forth at
§ 328-76C, the exemption is available if:
(a) The employee has provided an exemption certificate to the
employer;
(b) The Collector has not otherwise instructed the employer;
(c) The employer has not received notification from the person
who claimed the exemption or from the Collector that the
person has received earned income and/or net profits from all
sources within the municipality equal or in excess of $12,000 in
that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for
the tax exemption for that calendar year; and
(d) The employer has not paid to the person earned income within
the municipality an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in
that calendar year.
(3) If a person has claimed exemption from the tax under § 328-76C for
a given calendar year but either (a) the employer has received
notification from the person who claimed the exemption or from the
Collector that the person has received earned income and/or net
profits from all sources within the municipality equal to or in excess
of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise
ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or (b) the
employer has paid to the person earned income within the
municipality an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year and the employer shall withhold from the person, for
the first payroll period after receipt of the notification described in
clause (a) above or for the first payroll period after payments
described in clause (b) above have been made, a lump sum equal to
the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the
exemption claimed by the person plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll
period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall
be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this
subsection is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due and
the Collector may pursue collection under this article.
§ 328-77 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 328-77
1:769
§ 328-78. Direct payment by taxpayers.
Every taxpayer who is self-employed and has not filed an exemption
certification with the Collector, or whose tax for any other reason is not
collected under § 328-77 of this article, shall file a return on a form
prescribed by the Collector and shall pay a pro rata share of the tax directly
to the Collector within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The
pro rata share of the tax assessed on a taxpayer for a calendar quarter shall
be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by
four.
§ 328-79. Nonresident taxpayers.
Both resident and nonresident taxpayers shall, by virtue of engaging in an
occupation within the municipality, be subject to the tax and the provisions
of this article.
§ 328-80. Administration and enforcement.
The Collector, on behalf of the municipality, shall collect and receive the
taxes, interest, fines and penalties imposed by this article, and shall
maintain records showing interest, fines and penalties imposed by this
article, and shall maintain records showing the amount that is received
and the dates such amounts were received. The Collector shall prescribe
and issue all forms necessary for the administration of the tax and shall
enforce regulations adopted by the governing body relating to any matter
pertaining to the administration of this article, including, but not limited to,
requirements for collection through employers, requirements for evidence
and records, and provisions for the examination and correction of returns.
The Collector and any designated agents may examine the records of any
employer or supposed employer, or of any taxpayer or supposed taxpayer,
in order to ascertain the tax due or verify the accuracy of any return. Every
employer or supposed employer and every taxpayer or supposed taxpayer
shall give the Collector and any designated agent all means, facilities and
opportunity for the examinations hereby authorized. Any such examination
(4) Each employer shall ensure that exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each

or entity other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a temporary oversized vehicle parking permit or
display it on an oversized vehicle. Any such use or display by a
person or entity other than the permit holder shall constitute a
violation of this section by the permit holder and by the person or
entity who so used or displayed the temporary oversized vehicle
parking permit.
(4) The permit holder shall promptly repair any damage to the street
and other improvements within the right-of-way which are caused

A. Findings and purpose. The Township of South Whitehall finds that:
(1) Certain residential areas in the Township of South Whitehall are
subjected to commuter vehicle parking, therefore, depriving the
residents of those areas of spaces in which to park their own
vehicles;
(2) Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and,
(3) The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
§ 336-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 336-42
1:853
week. Therefore, the Township of South Whitehall considers it to
be in the interest of the people of the Township of South Whitehall
to provide for the establishment of a residential permit parking
program to insure primary access to available parking spaces by
neighborhood residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient air
level.
B. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE — A motor vehicle parked in a residential area
by a person not a resident of that residential area;
PROPRIETOR — A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address;
for the purpose of this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one
parking permit for that business or professional office address;
RESIDENT — A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona
fide occupancy, or both, at that address;
RESIDENTIAL AREA — A contiguous area containing public highways
or parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and non-business property (such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
C. Criteria. The residential areas designated in Subsection D of this
section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential
parking on the basis of the following criteria:
(1) During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of
vehicles parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in
the area is equal to 70% or more of the legal, on-street parking
capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal
parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
(2) During the same period as specified in Subsection C(1), directly
above, 10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the
streets in the area are not registered in the name of a person
residing in the area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest
available information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and
Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used.
Provided: in determining that a specific area identified as
impacted and eligible for residential permit parking is designated
as a residential permit parking area, the following factors are
taken into consideration:
§ 336-42 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 336-42
1:854
(a) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
(b) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Township of South Whitehall;
(c) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking
and related health and safety hazards;
(d) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
(e) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs
in connection with it; and,
(f) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit
parking program in proximity to establishments located in the
residential permit parking area and used by the general public
for religious, health or educational purposes.
D. Designation of residential permit parking areas. The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
Area Bounded By And Including
None
Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions
under which parking shall be by permit only.
E. Application for permit. Application for a residential parking permit shall
be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides on
or is a proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or other
location within a residential parking permit area. A separate
application shall be required for each motor vehicle, and each
application shall be accompanied by a permit fee, set pursuant to a
resolution of the Township of South Whitehall, which shall be for the
use of the Township of South Whitehall, to be applied to the cost of
administering the residential permit parking program. Each application
shall contain the following information: the name of the owner or the
driver, as the case may be, of the motor vehicle; the address of the
resident or the proprietor, as the case may be; the make, model and
registration number of the motor vehicle; and the driver number as
taken from the applicant's current driver's license. At the discretion of
the Chief of Police, the applicant shall be required, at the time of
making application, to present his driver's license and the vehicle
registration card.
F. Issuance of permit. Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee,
and determination by him that the information upon the application
shows that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the
§ 336-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 336-42
1:855
Chief of Police shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit,
which shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit
shall display the serial and registration numbers of the motor vehicles,
the residential parking area number, and the expiration date. The
permit shall be renewable annually before the expiration date, upon
making application for renewal and payment of the permit fee. It shall
be unlawful and a violation of this section for any person to display
other than the current and valid permit while standing or parking in a
residential permit parking area at any time when those permits are to
be displayed.
G. Temporary and exemption parking permits. Temporary parking permits
may be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee established
pursuant to a resolution, to bona fide visitors of residents of a
designated residential permit parking area, and exemption parking
permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to handicapped
persons.
H. Responsibility of permit holder.
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or
park a motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential
parking area during those times when parking of motor vehicles is
permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a residential
parking permit has been issued is so parked, that permit shall be
displayed so as to be clearly visible through the windshield of the
vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve
to the holder a parking space within a designated residential
permit parking area.
(2) A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand
or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when
stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set
aside for other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit
exempt its holder from the observance of any traffic or parking
regulation other than residential permit parking regulation or
restriction.
(3) No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a
vehicle operated; any such use or display by a person other than
the permit holder shall constitute a violation of this section by the
permit holder and by the person who so used or displayed the
parking permit.
(4) It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person falsely to
represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police in
order to obtain a residential parking permit.

1:856
§ 336-43. Extended on-street parking restricted. [Added 4-7-2010
by Ord. No. 911]
(a) Revocation of permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority
to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit holder
found to be in violation of any provision of this section. Upon
written notification to him of the revocation, the permit holder
shall surrender the permit to the Chief of Police. Failure to do
so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of this
section. Provided: any person receiving such a notice may,
within 10 days after the date of the notice, appeal to the
Township of South Whitehall for a hearing on the revocation,
and the decision of the Township of South Whitehall shall be
final.
A. Regulations. It shall be unlawful to:
(1) Place any nonmotorized vehicle or other item on a public street or
right-of-way for a period of more than 96 hours. As used in this
section, a nonmotorized vehicle shall include (a) any trailer or other
vehicular storage attachment which is unattached to an operable,
licensed and registered motor vehicle which is capable of towing it
while located within a public right-of-way; and (b) any unlicensed
uninspected trailer, if the trailer in question is of a weight or
dimension which requires licensing and inspection in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As used in this section, there shall
be a rebuttable presumption that a nonmotorized vehicle or other
item has been "continuously parked or stored" or stored, parked or
placed at a location for more than 96 consecutive hours if such
vehicle or item is found to be in approximately the same physical
location more than 96 hours after either is was first viewed by a
police officer in that location, or more than 96 hours after notice
has been placed thereon requesting that the vehicle or item be
removed from the public street.
(2) Park or place upon any public street or right-of-way any
mechanically inoperative vehicle for a period of more than 96
consecutive hours.

which does not bear a current registration plate and a current
inspection sticker affixed to it (if such inspection sticker is required
by law for the motor vehicle in question).
(4) Abandon any vehicle within a public right-of-way. "Abandon" as
used in this section shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the
Pennsylvania Vehicle Code.
(5) Place any vehicle or other item in the public right-of-way which in
any manner interferes with traffic or poses a hazard to persons or
property.

be in violation of Subsection A of this section shall, upon conviction
thereof, pay a fine of $15 for each day that the vehicle or item remains
in violation, together with costs of suit, and all costs associated with
removing and impounding such vehicle or item, if the fine is paid within
72 hours of the date that the vehicle or item, or the owner of same, has
been ticketed. If not paid within 72 hours, the fine shall be $30 for each
day following the date the vehicle or item, or owner of same, has been

Administration
§ 350-11. Zoning Officer.
This chapter shall be administered and enforced by an agent to be
appointed by the Board of Township Commissioners, who shall be known as
the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Officer shall meet qualifications established
by the Township and shall be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Township a working knowledge of municipal zoning. It shall be the duty
of the Zoning Officer to receive and maintain a record of all applications
for permits and a record of all permits issued, with notation of all special
conditions involved. He shall file copies of all plans submitted and the same
shall form a part of the records of his office and shall be available for
the use of the Zoning Hearing Board, the Board of Commissioners, other
Township officials and staff, and Township residents. Such records are and
shall remain the property of the Township.
§ 350-12. Zoning Map.
The boundaries of the districts enumerated by § 350-21 are hereby
established on the Zoning Map of South Whitehall Township. Such map
accompanies and is hereby declared to be a part of this chapter. Where
uncertainty exists as to the precise location of the boundaries shown on said
Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
§ 350-13. Zoning permit.
(a) District boundary lines.
(1) District boundary lines generally follow the centerline of streets
and streams, and lot lines as they exist on plans of record at the
time of the adoption of this chapter. Where a district boundary
divides a lot, the location of said boundary, unless the same is
indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the
scale appearing on the Map.
(2) Where a district boundary is not fixed by dimensions and where it
approximately follows a lot line, and where it does not scale more
than 20 feet therefrom, such lot lines shall be construed to be such
boundaries.
(3) In case any further uncertainty exists, the Zoning Officer shall
interpret the intent of the map as to location of district boundaries
within the Township.
(a) Zoning permits. Zoning permits shall be secured from the Zoning
Officer as follows:
(1) A zoning permit shall be secured prior to the creation of or change
to any use of a structure, building or of land. A permit shall be
§ 350-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-13
1:931
denied if the information submitted is incomplete, erroneous or
otherwise unsatisfactory.
(2) A zoning permit shall be secured for each nonconforming use and
each nonconforming structure including expansion of or change of
use or addition to a structure or change of use of the land. In the
event that such permit has not been applied for and the Zoning
Officer becomes aware of the nonconforming condition, the Zoning
Officer shall notify the owner of record of the provisions of this
section in writing. Said owner shall have 30 days in which to apply
for the proper permit.
(3) A zoning permit shall be secured prior to any alteration of any
building or structure or part of a building or structure.
(4) A zoning permit shall be secured for impervious surface and signs,
regardless of cost, or district in which located, in accordance with
§§ 350-48(o)(2) and 350-48(s)(10).
(b) Conditions for issuance of zoning permits. The Zoning Officer shall not
issue a permit for the use of any building or land unless all of the
following conditions have been satisfied:
(1) All requests for permits shall be made in writing by the legal or
equitable owner or his authorized agent, optionee, or an individual
or entity with demonstrable authority to do the work proposed on a
form to be supplied by the Zoning Officer. Requests for zoning
permits shall be accompanied by a plan prepared in accordance
with the standards established by the Township. Copies of these
standards are available at the Township Municipal Building.
(2) All fees for permits as established by the Board of Commissioners
shall have been paid to the Township.
(3) Approval, where required, of the Zoning Hearing Board has been
obtained in writing and all conditions of said approval have been or
will be complied with. All applications and/or supportive documents
shall be revised in accordance with the conditions of said approval.
(4) The building and/or use conforms to the provisions of this chapter,
except for:
(A) Variances to this chapter granted and approved in writing by
the Zoning Hearing Board; or
(B) The nonconforming use and/or nonconforming building or part
thereof was lawfully in existence prior to the enactment of this
chapter or its amendments.
(5) In the event that construction or use is commenced prior to the
issuance of any required permit, upon discovery of such
construction or use, all work shall be halted and a complete and
thorough inspection of unpermitted construction and use shall be
§ 350-13 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-13
1:932
§ 350-14. Zoning Officer preliminary opinion.
conducted by the Zoning Officer and appropriate Code
Enforcement Officers before any permit is issued.
(c) Issuance or denial of zoning permits. Zoning permits shall be issued or
denied by the Zoning Officer within 30 days of application. All permits
are subject to compliance with all other applicable ordinances, rules,
and regulations of the Township.
(d) Life of a zoning permit.
(1) Except where the duration of the use or building is limited by
action of the Zoning Hearing Board or provisions of this chapter or
any amendment, zoning permits shall be valid until such time as
there is a change in use or condition for which the permit was
originally issued.
(2) Where the duration of the use or building has been limited by
action of the Zoning Hearing Board or provisions of this chapter or
any amendment, the life of the zoning permit shall be equally
limited.
(3) In the event that a variance has been granted or other action has
been authorized by the Zoning Hearing Board, the applicant shall
secure the necessary permits and commence the authorized action,
construction or alteration within one year of the final action by the
Zoning Hearing Board. In the event construction has not
commenced within the one-year period, the variances,
authorizations and permits granted by the Zoning Hearing Board
are automatically revoked. The applicant may request in writing
extensions of the one-year period stating the reasons for delay. The
Zoning Hearing Board may grant extensions of the one-year period
if it finds that the reasons for such delay in construction are
justifiable and reasonable. When it is expected that the
construction or development authorized will commence in phases
over an extended period of time, the Zoning Hearing Board may
establish a schedule for the procurement of permits in lieu of the
one-year period specified above.
(e) Continuance of existing zoning permits. Nothing herein contained shall
require any change in plans, construction or designated use of a
building for which a zoning permit has been issued prior to
advertisement of the enactment of this chapter and construction of
which shall have been commenced within 30 days after advertisement
of this chapter and shall have been diligently prosecuted and the entire
building shall be completed within the life of zoning permit(s) or
authorized renewals of said zoning permit(s).
(a) Procedure to obtain preliminary opinion. In order not to unreasonably
delay the time when a landowner may secure assurance that the
§ 350-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-14
1:933
§ 350-15. Enforcement of Zoning Ordinance.
ordinance or map under which he proposed to build is free from
challenge, and recognizing that the procedure for preliminary approval
of the development may be too cumbersome or may be unavailable, the
landowner may advance the date from which time for any challenge to
the ordinance or map will run under Section 914.1 of the Municipalities
Planning Code by the following procedure:
(1) The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing
the proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a
preliminary opinion as to its compliance with the applicable
ordinances and maps. Such plans and other materials shall not be
required to meet the standards prescribed for preliminary,
tentative, or final approval or for the issuance of a building permit
so long as they provide reasonable notice of the proposed use or
development and a sufficient basis for a preliminary opinion as to
its compliance.
(2) If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice thereof
shall be published once each week for two consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Township. Such notice shall
include a general description of the proposed use or development
and its location, by some readily identifiable directive, and the
place and times where the plans and other materials may be
examined by the public. The favorable preliminary approval under
Section 914.1 and the time therein specified for commencing a
proceeding with the Board shall run from the time when the second
notice thereof had been published.
(a) Enforcement notice.
(1) If it appears to the Township that a violation of the South Whitehall
Township Ordinance has occurred, the Township shall initiate
enforcement proceedings by sending an enforcement notice as
provided in this Subsection (a).
(2) The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of the
parcel on which the violation has occurred, to any person who has
filed a written request to receive enforcement notices regarding
the parcel, and to any other person requested in writing by the
owner of record.
(3) An enforcement notice shall state at least the following:
(A) The name of the owner of record and any other person against
whom the Township intends to take action.
(B) The location of the property in violation.
§ 350-14 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-15
1:934
(C) The specific violation with a description of the requirements
which have not been met, citing in each instance the applicable
provisions of this chapter.
(D) The date before which the steps for compliance must be
commenced and the date before which the steps must be
completed.
(E) That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board within a prescribed period of time in
accordance with procedures set forth in this chapter.
(F) That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified,
unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board,
constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly
described.
(b) Civil enforcement proceeding; penalties.
(1) Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated
or permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall,
upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Township, before a district justice, pay a
judgment of not more than $500 per day plus all court costs,
including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a
result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied
or payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the
judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the
applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the district
justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good-faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating the ordinance to have believed
that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be
deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the district
justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable
attorney fees collected for the violation of zoning ordinances shall
be paid over to the Township.
(2) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted
to grant to any person or entity other than the Township the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this Subsection
(b).
(c) Equitable remedies. In case any building, structure, landscaping, or
land is, or is proposed to be, erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, converted, maintained or used in violation of this chapter or
any amendments, the Township Manager, his designee, or any Code
Enforcement Officer, or any aggrieved owner or tenant of real property
§ 350-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-15
1:935
§ 350-16. Zoning Hearing Board.
who shows that his property or person will be substantially affected
by the alleged violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute
any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or
abate such building, structure, landscaping, or land, or to prevent, in or
about such premises, any act, conduct, business or use constituting a
violation. When any such action is instituted by a landowner or tenant,
notice of that action shall be served upon the Township at least 30 days
prior to the time the action is begun by serving a copy of the complaint
on the Board of Commissioners of the Township. No such action may be
maintained until such notice has been given.
(a) Composition and organization.
(1) Present Zoning Hearing Board to continue. The Zoning Hearing
Board created and existing under the "South Whitehall Township
Zoning Ordinance" of 1961, as amended, shall continue under and
in accordance with the provisions of this article. Matters pending
before the Zoning Hearing Board at the time this chapter becomes
effective shall continue and be completed under the Zoning
Ordinance in effect at the time the Zoning Hearing Board took
jurisdiction of said matters.
(2) Membership. The membership of the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consist of five members who are residents of the Township,
appointed by resolution of the Board of Commissioners. Their
terms of office shall be five years in duration, staggered so that no
two members of the Zoning Hearing Board are eligible for
reappointment in any given year. The terms of office for members
of the Zoning Hearing Board hereafter appointed shall commence
on the first day of March, and conclude on the last day of February,
or until their successors are elected and qualified. The Zoning
Hearing Board shall promptly notify the Board of Commissioners of
any vacancies which occur. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be
only for the unexpired portion of the term. Members of the Zoning
Hearing Board shall hold no other office in the Township.
(3) Alternate members. The Board of Commissioners may appoint by
resolution at least one but no more than three residents of the
Township to serve as alternate members of the Zoning Hearing
Board. The term of office of an alternate member shall be three
years. When seated pursuant to the provisions of § 350-16(a)(5), an
alternate shall be entitled to participate in all proceedings and
discussions of the Zoning Hearing Board to the same and full extent
as provided by law for Board members, including specifically the
right to cast a vote as a voting member during the proceedings, and
shall have all the powers and duties set forth in this act and as
otherwise provided by law. Alternates shall hold no other office in
the Township including membership on the Planning Commission
and Zoning Officer. Any alternate may participate in any
§ 350-15 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-16
1:936
proceeding or discussion of the Board but shall not be entitled
to vote as a member of the Board unless designated as a voting
alternate member pursuant to § 350-16(a)(5).
(4) Removal of members. Any member may be removed for
malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance in office or for other just
cause by a majority vote of the Board of Commissioners taken after
the member has received 15 days' advance notice of the intent to
take such a vote. A hearing shall be held in connection with the vote
if the member shall make a request in writing.
(5) Organization.
(A) The Board shall elect from its own membership its officers,
who shall serve annual terms as such and may succeed
themselves. For the conduct of any hearing and the taking of
any action, a quorum shall be not less than a majority of all the
members of the Board, but the Board may appoint a Hearing
Officer from its own membership to conduct any hearing on its
behalf and the parties may waive further action by the Board as
provided in § 350-16(e)(1).
(B) If, by reason of absence or disqualification of a member, a
quorum is not reached, the Chairman of the Board shall
designate as many alternate members of the Board to sit on the
Board as may be needed to provide a quorum. Any alternate
member of the Board shall continue to serve on the Board in all
proceedings involving the matter or case for which the
alternate was initially appointed until the Board has made a
final determination of the matter or case. Designation of an
alternate pursuant to this section shall be made on a case-bycase
basis in rotation according to declining seniority among
all alternates.
(C) The Board may make, alter and rescind rules and forms for its
procedure, consistent with ordinances of the Township and
laws of the commonwealth. The Board shall keep full public
records of its business, which records shall be the property of
the Township, and shall submit a report of its activities to the
Board of Commissioners as requested by the Board of
Commissioners.
(6) Expenditures for service. Within the limits of funds appropriated by
the Board of Commissioners, the Board may employ or contract for
secretaries, clerks, legal counsel, consultants and other technical
and clerical services. Members of the Board may receive
compensation for the performance of their duties, as may be fixed
by the Board of Commissioners, but in no case shall it exceed the
rate of compensation authorized to be paid to the members of the
Board of Commissioners. Alternate members of the Board may
receive compensation, as may be fixed by the Board of
§ 350-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-16
1:937
Commissioners, for the performance of their duties when
designated as alternate members pursuant to § 350-16(a)(5), but in
no case shall such compensation exceed the rate of compensation
authorized to be paid to the members of the Board of
Commissioners.
(b) Jurisdiction.
(1) Zoning Hearing Board jurisdiction and functions.
(A) Jurisdiction. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and render final adjudications in the
following matters:

ordinance, except those brought before the Board of
Commissioners pursuant to Section 609.1 and 916.1(a)(2)
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
(ii) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer,
including, but not limited to, the granting or denial of any
zoning permit, or failure to act on the application therefor,
the issuance of any cease and desist order or the
registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use,
structure or lot.
(iii) Appeals from a determination by a Township Engineer or
the Zoning Officer with reference to the administration of
any floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such
provisions within a land use ordinance.
(iv) Application for variances from the terms of the zoning
ordinance and flood hazard ordinance or provisions within
the ordinances.
(v) Applications for special exceptions under the zoning
ordinance or floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or
provisions within the ordinances.
(vi) Appeals from the Zoning Officer's determination under
Section 916.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code.
(vii) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or
Township Engineer in the administration of any land use
ordinance or provision thereof with reference to
sedimentation and erosion control and stormwater
management insofar as the same relate to development
not involving planned residential development or
subdivision and land development applications.
(c) Variances.
§ 350-16 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-16
1:938
(1) Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant. The Board may, by rule, prescribe the
form of application and may require preliminary application to the
Zoning Officer. In granting any variance, the Board may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter and the laws
of the commonwealth. The Board may grant a variance provided
the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(A) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located;
(B) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance
and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary
to enable the reasonable use of the property;
(C) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
(D) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare;
(E) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue;
(F) The variance shall not authorize a use that is not permitted in
the Zoning Ordinance and which could more properly be
considered a rezoning to be heard by the South Whitehall
Township Board of Commissioners.
(d) Special exceptions.
(1) Special exceptions. Where this chapter has stated special
exceptions to be granted or denied by the Zoning Hearing Board,
the Board shall hear and decide requests for such special
exceptions in accordance with applicable standards and criteria
contained herein. In granting a special exception, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards in addition to
those expressed by this chapter, as it may deem necessary to
§ 350-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-16
1:939
implement the purposes of this chapter and the laws of the
commonwealth. Standards and criteria for special exception uses
are as follows. Such use shall be:

district in which the use is proposed and promote the
harmonious and orderly development of such zoning district;

protected and reasonable consideration is given to, but not
limited to, the character of the neighborhood and zoning
district, conservation of property values, and traffic safety and
road capacities;
(F) Compatible with the character and type of development
existing in the area that surrounds the site and permitted in
the underlying zoning district, in terms of the size, scale,
height and bulk of the proposed uses and the size, shape and
placement of buildings and other structures;
(G) Compatible with the uses permitted in the surrounding area
and permitted in the underlying zoning district, in terms of the
density and/or intensity of land use;
(H) Reflective of sound engineering and land development design
and construction principles, practices and techniques;
(I) Provide safe and efficient access to roads and will not create
traffic congestion, hazardous traffic conditions or excessive
traffic volumes;
(J) Provide continuity of existing circulation systems, including
roads, sidewalks, and trails;

1:941
hearing before the Board or Hearing Officer shall be held
within 45 days of the prior hearing, unless otherwise
agreed to by the applicant in writing or on the record. An

of the applicant, the Board or Hearing Officer shall assure
that the applicant receives at least seven hours of hearing
within the 100 days including the first hearing. Persons
opposed to the application shall complete the presentation
of their opposition to the application within 100 days of the
first hearing held after the completion of the applicant's
case-in-chief. An applicant may, upon request, be granted
additional hearings to complete his case-in-chief provided
the persons opposed to the application are granted an
equal number of additional hearings. Persons opposed to
the application may, upon the written consent or consent
on the record by the applicant and municipality, be
granted additional hearings to complete their opposition
to the application provided the applicant is granted an

§ 350-16 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-16
1:942
(vii) The Board or the Hearing Officer, as the case may be, shall
keep a stenographic record of the proceedings. The
appearance fee for a stenographer shall be shared equally

noticed and shall not inspect the site or its surroundings with
any party or his representative unless all parties are given an
opportunity to be present.
(E) Decisions.
(i) The Board or the Hearing Officer, as the case may be, shall
render a written decision or, when no decision is called for,
make written findings on the application within 45 days
after the last hearing before the Board or Hearing Officer.
Where the application is contested or denied, each
decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions based thereon together with the reasons
therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code or of any
ordinance, rule or regulation, shall contain a reference to
the provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion
is deemed appropriate in the light of the facts found. If the
hearing is conducted by a Hearing Officer, and there has
been no stipulation that his decision or findings are final,
the Board shall make his report and recommendations
available to the parties within 45 days and the parties shall
be entitled to make written representations thereon to the
Board prior to final decision or entry of findings, and the
Board's decision shall be entered no later than 30 days
after the report of the Hearing Officer. Except for
challenges filed under Section 916.1 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code where the Board fails to
render the decision within the period required by this
section or fails to commence, conduct or complete the
required hearing, as provided in § 350-16(e)(1), the
§ 350-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-16
1:943
decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor
of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing
or on the record for an extension of time. When a decision
has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the
failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as herein
above provided, the Board shall give public notice of said
decision within 10 days from the last day it could have
met to render a decision in the same manner as provided
in Subsection (e)(1)(A) of this subsection. If the Board
shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do so.
Nothing in this paragraph shall prejudice the right of any
party opposing the application to appeal the decision to a
court of competent jurisdiction.
(ii) A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called
for, of the findings, shall be delivered to the applicant
personally or mailed to him not later than the day
following its date. To all other persons who have filed their
name and address with the Board not later than the last
day of the hearing, the Board shall provide, by mail or
otherwise, brief notice of the decision or findings and a
statement of the place at which the full decision or findings
may be examined.
(F) Parties Appellant Before the Zoning Hearing Board. Appeals
under § 350-16(b)(1) may be filed with the Board in writing by
any officer or agency of the Township, or any person aggrieved
or his agent. Requests for a variance under § 350-16(c)(1) and
for special exception under § 350-16(d) may be filed with the
Board by any landowner or any tenant with the permission of
such landowner.
(G) Time limitation. No person shall be allowed to file any
proceeding with the Board later than 30 days after an
application for development, preliminary or final, has been
approved by an appropriate municipal officer, agency or body if
such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the
approval in any manner unless such person alleges and proves
that he had no notice, knowledge, or reason to believe that
such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded to
his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the
knowledge of his predecessor in interest. All appeals from
determinations adverse to the landowners shall be filed by the
landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.
(H) Stay of proceedings. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to
in § 350-16(b)(1) and during its pendency before the Board, all
land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order
or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and
all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the Zoning
§ 350-16 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-16
1:944
Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the
Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property, in which case, the development or
official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by
the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition
after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency
or body. When an application for development, preliminary
or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed
to reserve or limit the approval are filed with the Board by
persons other than the applicant, the applicant may petition
the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such
persons to post bond as a condition to continuing the
proceedings before the Board. The question whether or not
such petition shall be granted and the amount of the bond shall
be within the sound discretion of the court.
(f) Optional: mediation.
(1) Mediation option.
(A) Parties to proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board, Board
of Commissioners, or the courts in connection with this chapter
may utilize mediation as an aid in completing such
proceedings. In proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board,
in no case shall the Zoning Hearing Board initiate mediation or
participate as a mediating party. Mediation shall supplement,
not replace, those procedures in this chapter and the
Municipalities Planning Code once they have been formally
initiated. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
expanding or limiting the Township Police powers or as
modifying any principles of substantive law.
(B) Participation in mediation shall be wholly voluntary. The
appropriateness of mediation shall be determined by the
particulars of each case and the willingness of the parties to
negotiate. The Township shall assure that, in each case, the
mediating parties, assisted by the mediator as appropriate,
develop terms and conditions for:
(i) Funding mediation.
(ii) Selecting a mediator who, at a minimum, shall have a
working knowledge of municipal zoning and subdivision
procedures and demonstrated skills in mediation.
(iii) Completing mediation, including time limits for such
completion.
(iv) Suspending time limits otherwise authorized in this
chapter and the Municipalities Planning Code, provided
there is written consent by the mediating parties, and by
§ 350-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-16

§ 350-17. Process to amend Zoning Ordinance.
an applicant or the Board of Commissioners if either is not
a party to the mediation.
(v) Identifying all parties and affording them the opportunity
to participate.
(vi) Subject to legal restraints, determining whether some or
all of the mediation sessions shall be open or closed to the
public.
(vii) Assuring that mediated solutions are in writing and signed
by the parties, and become subject to review and approval
by the appropriate decision-making body pursuant to the
authorized procedures set forth in the other sections of
this chapter and in the Municipalities Planning Code.
(C) No offers or statements made in the mediation sessions,
excluding the final written mediated agreement, shall be
admissible as evidence in any subsequent judicial or
administrative proceedings.
(g) Appeals to courts.
(1) Appeals to courts.
(A) Zoning appeals. Zoning appeals shall include appeals from
decisions of the Zoning Hearing Board and appeals upon
reports of the Board in proceedings to challenge the validity of
any ordinance or map.
(B) Who may appeal. Zoning appeals shall be taken to the Common
Pleas Court of the County of Lehigh, Pennsylvania, by any party
before the Zoning Hearing Board, or any officer or agency of
the Township of South Whitehall, or any other aggrieved party.
(C) Time limitation. All zoning appeals shall be filed no later than
30 days after the issuance of notice of the decision or report of
the Zoning Hearing Board.
(D) Procedures for appeals and challenges. Procedures for appeals
and challenges shall be those prescribed by Article X-A of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.

Commissioners of South Whitehall Township may, from time to time,
supplement, change, modify, or otherwise amend or repeal this chapter,

where copies of the proposed amendment may be examined, in
addition to the time and place of the hearing. Such notice shall
be published pursuant to the requirements of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.
(A) Before voting on the enactment of a proposed amendment, the
Board of Commissioners shall hold a public hearing thereon,
pursuant to public notice. In addition, if the proposed
amendment involves a Zoning Map change, notice of said
public hearing shall be conspicuously posted by the Township
at points deemed sufficient by the Township along the
perimeter of the lot(s) to notify potentially interested citizens.
The affected lot(s) shall be posted at least one week prior to the
date of the hearing.
(i) In addition to the requirement that notice be posted under
§ 350-17(a)(1)(A), where the proposed amendment
involves a Zoning Map change notice of the public hearing
shall be mailed by the Township at least 30 days prior to
the date of the hearing by first class mail to the addresses
to which real estate tax bills are sent for all real property
located with the area(s) being rezoned, as evidenced by

notice shall include the location, date and time of the
public hearing. A good faith effort and substantial
compliance shall satisfy the requirements of this
subsection.
(ii) This clause shall not apply when the rezoning constitutes a
comprehensive rezoning.
(2) In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the
Planning Commission, the Board of Commissioners shall submit
each such amendment to the Planning Commission at least 30 days
prior to the public hearing on the proposed amendment to provide
the Planning Commission an opportunity to submit
recommendations.
(3) The proposed amendment shall also be forwarded to the Lehigh
Valley Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the public
hearing on the amendment by the Board of Commissioners.

Base Zoning Districts
§ 350-21. Base zoning districts created.
For the purposes of this chapter, the Township of South Whitehall is hereby
divided into 17 base zoning districts as follows:
§ 350-22. Intent of districts.
The intended uses of the various zoning districts are described as follows
and shall be relied upon for interpretation and administration of this
chapter.
(a) Residential districts.
RR-3 Rural Residential-3
RR-2 Rural Residential-2
R-R Rural Residential and Agricultural
R-2 Low Density Residential
R-3 Low Density Residential
R-4 Medium Density Residential
R-5 Medium Density Residential

NC Neighborhood Commercial
HC Highway Commercial
HC-1 Highway Commercial-1 (Special Height Limitation)
GC-1 General Commercial-1 (Special Height Limitation)
GC General Commercial
OC Office Commercial
(c) Industrial districts.
IC-1 Industrial Commercial-1 (Special Height Limitation)
I Industrial
(a) Residential districts. The residential districts are intended to provide
sufficient area in appropriate locations for residential uses and
development to meet the housing needs of the Township with due
allowance for providing a choice of sites and types of housing without
sacrificing desirable established residential patterns. The Rural
Residential and Agricultural Districts are to foster agricultural and
rural residential uses and activities until such time as growth of the
§ 350-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-22
1:953
§ 350-23. Uses not specifically listed.
community and the availability of the necessary utilities and related
municipal services warrant a change of use compatible with the intent
of the Comprehensive Plan phased development. A corresponding
amendment to this chapter will be required at that time.
(b) Commercial districts. The commercial districts are intended to provide
sufficient area in appropriate locations for various forms and types of
business uses and development, to satisfy the needs of modern business
development by providing for off-street parking and loading and
unloading areas, safe and efficient means of vehicle ingress and egress,
and continuity and homogeneity of business development; to encourage
the development of attractive, functional and economic forms of
commercial and mixed-use buildings and developments under proper
standards; to encourage the enhancement and beautification of
commercial areas; and to minimize any negative impacts of commercial
areas on adjoining residential areas. In the event that there is an
existing single detached dwelling unit or two-unit dwelling in a
commercial district, the expansion of said building or the establishment
of accessory uses for said dwellings may be permitted provided the
proposal is in compliance with the residential district it abuts or, if not
abutting a residential district, the standards of an R-5 Residential
District as a minimum.
(c) Industrial districts. The industrial districts are intended to provide
suitable space for industrial and commercial types of business and
development not ordinarily found in, nor desirable in, other districts, to
satisfy the needs for this type of development by providing for off-street
parking and loading and unloading areas to encourage the development
of attractive, functional and economic forms of commercial office, and
industrial development; and to minimize the effect of industrial/
commercial areas on the adjoining residential areas. The industrial
districts are only intended to contain residences under specific
conditions, such as an overlay district. In the event that there is an
existing single detached dwelling unit or two-unit dwelling in an
industrial district, the expansion of said building or the establishment of
accessory uses for said dwelling may be permitted provided the
proposal is in compliance with the residential district it abuts or, if not
abutting a residential district, the standards of an R-5 Residential
District as a minimum.
(1) The Industrial Commercial District is intended to provide suitable
space for modest-size light industrial establishments and those
commercial activities that are compatible with the industrial
activities.
(2) The Industrial District provides for larger establishments and more
intense industrial activity.
§ 350-22 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-23
1:954
§ 350-24. Zoning District Schedules.
(a) Uses not listed. A use not listed in any Zoning District Schedule shall be
permitted by special exception in the Industrial (I) Zoning District.
(b) Similar uses. The Zoning Hearing Board may determine that a proposed
use is sufficiently similar in character and impact to that of a listed use
and that the proposed use may be treated the same as the listed use.
(a) Definitions used in the Schedules. Districts are defined in § 350-21.
Classification of uses are defined in § 350-41 and definitions of specific
uses are contained in § 350-05.
(b) Conflict with other sections. Sections of this chapter that are more
restrictive than the Zoning District Schedules shall take precedence
over the Zoning District Schedules.

11 Existing dimensional requirements of the underlying zoning district shall apply
to the historic resource. Any alterations or adaptive re-use of the historic
resource may require approval of a conditional use as referenced in
§ 350-48(h)(3).
(B) CR Zoning District Map:
(i) Non-lineal setbacks. Notwithstanding the other setback
provisions of this chapter, there are certain areas near the
boundary of the CR Zoning District, which, as a result of
artificially created berms, irregularities in the boundary
itself, and the existence of nonresidential uses, render
strict compliance with lineal setbacks inappropriate. The
supplemental zoning map of the C-R District incorporates
the setbacks established under this section (the "CR
District Zoning Map").
§ 350-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-24
1:1039
(ii) CR District Regions. The CR District shall include areas
identified on the CR Zoning District Map as:
[1] Buffer Regions (green):
[a] Areas to be reserved for landscaped berms, an
internal road network for use by park
maintenance and security vehicles (except those
associated with parking), green space, detention
areas and utility-like uses.
[2] Restricted Regions (orange):
[a] Areas which may include all permitted, accessory
and special exception uses otherwise set forth in
the CR Zoning District. However, any commercial
amusements in the Restricted Regions may not
§ 350-24 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-24
1:1040
exceed a height of 30 feet. If any portion of a
Restricted Region is used for commercial
amusements, to the extent geographically and
topographically reasonable, a landscaped berm
eight feet in height and at least 25 feet wide
shall be established (if not already in existence)
in that portion of the Buffer Region between the
commercial amusement and the closest abutting
lot if that lot is zoned residential.
[3] Standard Regions (white/white-crosshatched in red):
[a] Areas which may include all permitted, accessory
and special exception uses otherwise set forth in
the C-R Zoning District, provided the height of
any commercial amusement in the Standard
Region may not exceed an elevation of 540 feet
above mean sea level. If any portion of a Standard
Region is used for commercial amusements, a
landscaped berm eight feet in height and at least
25 feet wide must be established (if not already in
existence) in that portion of the Buffer Region
between the commercial amusement and the
closest abutting property if that property is zoned
residential.
[b] Certain identified portions of the Standard Region
are not used for commercial amusements as of the
date of this amendment. Accordingly, commercial
amusements will not be permitted in those areas
pursuant to this amendment. Those areas are
crosshatched in red on the C-R District Zoning
Map and are referred to as Standard (Limited
Use).
(C) Additional performance criteria:
(i) Additional rides. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this chapter, three additional commercial amusements in
excess of 85 feet in height may be placed in the Standard
Region after the effective date of this amendment to this
chapter. Any existing commercial amusement in excess of
85 feet in height, and any commercial amusement in
excess of 85 feet in height to be established under this
section, may be replaced or modified, provided the total
number of commercial amusements in excess of 85 feet
shall not exceed the number of commercial amusement in
excess of 85 feet in height as of the effective date of this
amendment to this chapter plus the three additional
commercial amusements in excess of 85 feet in height
permitted hereunder. Any new amusement added pursuant
§ 350-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-24
1:1041
to this subsection shall be located in the approximate
location of the replaced amusement.
(ii) Fall zone. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, the height of any future commercial amusement
shall be less than the distance from such amusement to the
nearest residential lot line or public road.
(iii) Sound, light and privacy. To the extent any commercial
amusements are established pursuant to
§ 350-24(c)(15)(C)(i) after the effective date of this
amendment to this chapter or any existing commercial
amusement is replaced or modified after the effective date
of this amendment to the chapter:
[1] Any speakers or sound systems may not be focused or
directed towards any adjoining residential properties;
[2] Any lighting may not be focused or directed toward
any adjoining residential properties (for purposes of
this section, it is permissible to have the illumination
visible from the adjoining residential properties, but
not directed at such residential properties); and
[3] A baffle or screen shall be added to such commercial
amusement if any such commercial amusement is
designed so that patrons could view into any adjoining
residential properties for any extended period of time.
(D) Screening requirements. Buffer Region plantings: Coniferous
trees of at least 10 feet in height, and no more than 10 feet
from one planting to the next, shall be planted in the Buffer
Regions required under § 350-24(c)(15)(B)(ii).
(E) Conflicts. The provisions of this § 350-24(c)(15) shall govern to
the extent any provisions hereof conflict with any other
provisions of this chapter.

ARTICLE 3
Special Districts and Development Types
§ 350-31. Provisions for Innovation Overlay Districts.
(a) Creation of overlay districts. For the purposes of this chapter, the
Township of South Whitehall establishes five overlay districts as
follows:
(1) Overlay Districts:
Neighborhood Infill Development Overlay District
TND-Residential Cluster Overlay District
TND-Commercial Retrofit Overlay District
TND-Industrial Retrofit and Infill Overlay District
Active Adult Neighborhood Development Overlay District
(b) Purpose of overlay districts.
(1) The overlay districts are intended to address areas deemed by the
Township to have the potential for compact growth, including, but
not limited to, areas designated as "Growth Opportunity Areas" on
the Future Land Use Plan of the 2009 South Whitehall Township
Comprehensive Plan. These areas are intended to be developed,
redeveloped, or infilled under specific sets of design standards and
development regulations that address the unique conditions of
each area and a particular vision for future land use. The design
standards and development regulations pertain to such elements
as:
(A) Providing for a mix of uses;
(B) Promoting traditional neighborhood development;
(C) Locating buildings close to streets and sidewalks;
(D) Locating parking to the side or rear of buildings;
(E) Creating enhanced streetscapes, and street edges with street
walls;
(F) Enhancing landscaping;
(G) Providing an increased variety of types and forms of housing;
(H) Providing useable open space; and
(I) Enabling increased building heights.
(2) The full set of design standards and development regulations are
set forth in § 350-31 and Appendix C.313 The AAND-O is not subject
§ 350-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-31
1:1055
to the design standards and development regulations set forth in
§ 350-31(g) or Appendix C.
(c) General intent of all innovation overlay districts. The Innovation
Overlay Districts are intended to:
(1) Provide flexibility and innovation in designing new developments
by offering an alternative to the conventional development
permitted by the underlying zoning districts.
(2) Recognize the distinct physical characteristics of the individual
Innovation Overlay District and enable new development, infill, and
redevelopment that will complement and enhance those
characteristics.
(3) Increase opportunities for mixed-use development, thereby:
(A) Creating greater efficiencies in land use;
(B) Promoting a more efficient use of infrastructure in order to
reduce associated costs;
(C) Creating opportunities to fulfill some daily tasks without the
use of an automobile; and
(D) Supporting alternative transportation (bus transit) with the
development of new population hubs.
(4) Promote a greater mix of dwelling types for all ages and
circumstances throughout the Township.
(5) Expand and enhance the open space and pedestrian network in
accordance with the Official Map.
(6) Promote context sensitive massing, proportion, positioning, height,
streetscape elements, and landscaping.
(d) Identification of the Innovation Overlay Districts. There are five specific
Innovation Overlay Districts depicted on the Zoning District Map. Each
district has specific regulations as set forth in this § 350-31 and in, with
regard to Districts (1) through (4) as listed below, Appendix C. The
Overlay Districts are as follows:
(1) Neighborhood Infill Development Overlay District, subcategorized
as follows:
(A) Broadway Neighborhood Infill Development Overlay District.
(B) Greenawalds Neighborhood Infill Development Overlay
District.
313. Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 350-31 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-31
1:1056
(C) Clifford Park Neighborhood Infill Development Overlay
District.
(2) TND-Residential Cluster.
(3) TND-Commercial Retrofit.
(4) TND-Industrial Retrofit and Infill.
(5) Active Adult Neighborhood Development Overlay — AAND-O.
(e) Applicability.
(1) Application of the Neighborhood Infill Innovation Overlay District
for residential uses shall be permitted by right. Nonresidential uses
in the Neighborhood Infill Overlay District shall be permitted as a
conditional use approved by the Board of Commissioners in
accordance with §§ 350-18 and 350-41(e).
(2) Application of the TND Innovation Overlay Districts provisions is
optional and shall be available to applicants meeting the eligibility
criteria contained in each overlay district and with conditional use
approval by the Board of Commissioners in accordance with the
specific standards contained herein and the general standards set
forth in § 350-41(e).
(A) See submission requirements for TND Innovation Overlay
Districts in the Township's then-current Subdivision and Land
Development Regulations/Ordinance.314
(3) For applicants who do not meet the eligibility criteria or who
choose not to develop using the Innovation Overlay District option,
the provisions of the underlying zoning districts shall govern. All
existing uses within the Innovation Overlay Districts shall be
governed by the applicable underlying zoning district regulations.
(4) Where an applicant meets the eligibility criteria and elects to
develop pursuant to the Innovation Overlay District, the
regulations contained herein, § 350-31, shall apply. Where these
regulations apply and conflict with those of the underlying district,
these regulations shall supersede. Where regulations are not
specified in the Innovation Overlay District, but are specified within
the underlying district, the underlying district regulations shall
govern.
(5) The design standards found in Appendix C shall apply to all
development applications for the Innovation Overlay Districts, as
specified within each district.
(f) Overlay districts:
314. Editor's Note: See Ch. 312, Subdivision and Land Development.

(ii) Greenawalds Neighborhood, designated as 1b; and
(iii) Clifford Park Neighborhood, designated as 1c.
(B) Uses. In addition to uses permitted as primary uses, accessory
uses, or uses by special exception in the underlying zoning
districts, the following additional uses shall be permitted as a
conditional use within the Neighborhood Infill Overlay District:
(i) Retail sales; personal service business; or business or
professional office (less than 5,000 square feet per use);
(ii) Mixed-use building, with uses listed in Subsection (f)(1)(A)
above located on the first floor and business or
professional office uses and/or apartment uses located

12 The uses listed in this chart are only permitted if the uses are a part of
an active adult neighborhood development, subject to the provisions of this
§ 350-31(f)(5). Two or more of the above listed nonresidential primary uses and
residential uses in an active adult neighborhood development that is developed
as a condominium are permitted on the same lot as part of an active adult
neighborhood development. Nonresidential primary uses and residential uses in
an active adult neighborhood development that is developed as a condominium
are exempt from any ordinance provision which limits a single lot to one primary
use.
13 There is no individual side yard setback; however, both side yard setbacks
combined must equal or exceed 15 feet, and provided that no side yard setback
is less than five feet.
14 Except for patios, decks, porches, entryways, porch/entryway roofs, bay
windows, and fireplaces which may extend into the rear and/or side yard
setback provided that the patios, decks, porches, entryways, porch/entryway
roofs, bay windows, and fireplaces are no closer than five feet to the rear and/
or side lot line.
§ 350-31 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-31
1:1106
15 The front yard setback shall be measured from the cartway; however, where
there is a sidewalk located between the building or structure and the cartway
the front yard setback shall be measured from the edge of the sidewalk closest
to the building or structure.
16 A community center may have associated with it as accessory uses the several
recreational accessory uses provided for in this section.
17 A community center shall provide 20 square feet of interior building space for
each dwelling unit within the active adult neighborhood development.
18 Off-street parking and access drives for the community center, and

property lines, except where an access drive intersects with a public or private
street.
19 Temporary construction site trailer shall comply with the provisions of
§ 350-48(t)(1).
(B) Intent. The purpose of this district is to provide housing and
recreational facilities for "older persons" as that term is
defined in the Federal Fair Housing Act, as amended, and in
regulations promulgated (or to be promulgated) thereunder, on
tracts of land that are consistent with an environment for
housing and permitted amenities for "older persons." This
district recognizes that compared to housing that is not agerestricted,
households with persons aged 55 and older without
minor children: a) do not create burdens upon the public
school system, b) create little demand for athletic fields, c)
generate less traffic, d) involve lower water and sanitary
sewage flows, and e) need fewer parking spaces. This district
recognizes the sense of community and lessened private
maintenance responsibilities associated with homes being
located closer together than in most other single-family-home
developments not involving a community owners' association.
In addition, this district seeks to conform to the South
Whitehall Township Comprehensive Plan by encouraging the
creation of neighborhoods. The active adult neighborhood
development allows for mix of age-restricted residential
development along with neighborhood-appropriate
commercial uses that fosters a sense of place and encourages
walkability.
(C) Overlay district. The AAND-O is an overlay zoning district.
Therefore, the underlying base zoning districts remain in full
force and effect and shall apply when a property is not
developed utilizing the provisions of the AAND-O. However, the
provisions of the AAND-O, and not those of the underlying base
zoning districts, shall apply to all zoning, subdivision, and land
development applications submitted for approval under the
AAND-O.
§ 350-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-31
1:1107
(D) Age-restricted requirements. An active adult neighborhood
development ("AAND") shall be designed and operated for
occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older in accordance
with the following requirements:
(i) The AAND shall be age-qualified in accordance with the
Federal Fair Housing Act. Specifically, an AAND shall meet
the requirements for a development to be considered as
"housing for older persons" and "intended and operated
for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older", as
those terms are defined and limited in Section 805(d)(2)(c)
of the Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C.
§ 3607(b)(2)(c), as amended, and regulations promulgated
(or promulgated in the future) thereunder (the "Fair
Housing Act").
(ii) The residential portion of every AAND shall be organized
as a common interest community association as either a
homeowners' association under the Uniform Planned
Communities Act, 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101 et seq., or
condominium association under the Uniform
Condominium Act, 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 3101 et seq., whose
members shall consist of all unit owners, which association
shall maintain commonly owned areas, private streets,
recreation areas, open space facilities, and other common
facilities. All unit owners in an AAND shall be required to
pay necessary fees to the homeowners' or condominium
association, with a proper enforcement mechanism as
provided by state law. The declaration of the planned
community or condominium for the residential portion of
the AAND shall provide and require that the residential
portion of the AAND qualifies and remains qualified as a
development providing housing for older persons as that
term is defined under the Fair Housing Act.
(E) Accessory uses. In addition to the accessory uses listed in
§ 350-31(f)(5), the following accessory uses shall be permitted
in an AAND:
(i) Uses that are customarily incidental and subordinate to a
dwelling unit permitted in an AAND.
(ii) Uses that are customarily incidental and subordinate to a
nonresidential use permitted in an AAND.
(F) Dimensional requirements. The dimensional requirements for
an AAND shall be in lieu of all other dimensional requirements
set forth in this chapter and also in lieu of all other dimensional
requirements in Township ordinances to the extent such
requirements are addressed herein; if the dimensional
requirements of § 350-31(f)(5)(A) or this section conflict with
§ 350-31 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-31

developer shall provide for and establish an organization for the
ownership, maintenance, and preservation of common open space
which shall conform to the following standards and procedures:
§ 350-32 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-32
1:1128
(1) The organization shall be established by the developer before the
sale or rent of dwelling units in the PRD.
(2) The form, financial capability, rules of membership, and methods of
cost assessment of the organization shall be devised so as to insure
the successful fulfillment of the maintenance, preservation, and
improvement responsibilities of the organization.
(3) The organization responsible for maintenance, preservation, and
improvement of common open space areas shall be the sole owner
of the common open space lands.
(4) The organization shall have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and maintain the common open space.
(5) In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
a common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any
time after establishment of the planned residential development
fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the development plan, South
Whitehall Township may serve written notice upon such
organization or upon the residents and owners of the planned
residential development setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand that
such deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within 30 days
thereof, and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon
which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing,
South Whitehall Township may modify the terms of the original
notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time
within which they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies set forth in
the original notice or in the modification thereof shall not be
corrected within said 30 days or any extension thereof, South
Whitehall Township, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the planned residential development and to
prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance,
may enter upon said common open space and maintain the same
for a period of one year. Said entry and maintenance shall not
constitute a taking of said common open space, nor vest in the
public any rights to use the same. Before the expiration of said
year, South Whitehall Township, upon its initiative or upon the
request of the organization theretofore responsible for the
maintenance of the common open space shall call a public hearing
upon notice to such organization, or to the residents and owners of
the planned residential development, to be held by South Whitehall
Township, at which hearing such organization or the residents and
owners of the planned residential development shall show cause
why such maintenance by South Whitehall Township shall not, at
the option of the South Whitehall Township, continue for a
succeeding year. If South Whitehall Township shall determine that
such organization is ready and able to maintain said common open
§ 350-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-32
1:1129
space in reasonable condition, South Whitehall Township shall
cease to maintain said common open space at the end of said year.
If South Whitehall Township shall determine such organization
is not ready and able to maintain said common open space in
a reasonable condition, South Whitehall Township may, in its
discretion, continue to maintain said common open space during
the next succeeding year and subject to a similar hearing and
determination in each year thereafter. The decision of South
Whitehall Township in any such case shall constitute a final
administrative decision subject to judicial review.
(6) The cost of such maintenance by South Whitehall Township shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the planned
residential development that have a right of enjoyment of the
common open space and if not reimbursed shall become a lien on
said properties. South Whitehall Township, at the time of entering
upon said common open space for the purpose of maintenance,
shall file a notice of lien in the office of the Prothonotary of Lehigh
County, upon the properties affected by the lien within the planned
residential development.
(7) Public dedication of common open space: The developer may
propose to offer common open space for dedication to any of the
following entities rather than maintenance by a homeowners'
association: the Township, the Parkland School District, the County
of Lehigh, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the United States of
America, a municipality authority, or an environmental
organization acceptable to the Board of Commissioners. However,
it is with the discretion of the South Whitehall Township Board of
Commissioners whether such an offer of dedication may be made,
or whether a homeowners' association shall undertake operation
and maintenance of the common open space. If the South Whitehall
Township Board of Commissioners chooses to accept dedication of
the common open space, or permits another entity to accept
dedication of the common open space, the acceptance may only
take place after the developer has improved the common open
space in accordance with the requirements of § 350-32(g)(4), the
provisions of the Subdivision and Land Development Regulations
incorporated therein, and the landscape plan referred to in
§ 350-32(g)(4)(10). An offer of dedication of common open space
made by the developer in the development plan and accepted or
approved by South Whitehall Township shall constitute a fulfillment
of responsibility for providing and maintaining common open space
areas. Under any other circumstances, provision for dedication
must be made subject to § 350-32(k).
(i) Development in stages. A planned residential development may be
developed in stages if the following standards are met:
(1) The location and approximate time of construction of each stage
are clearly marked on the development plan.
§ 350-32 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-32
1:1130
(2) At least 15% of the dwelling units in the development plan are
included in the first stage.
(3) The second and subsequent stages are completed consistent with
the development plan and are of such size and location that they
constitute economically sound units of development. In no event
shall such stages contain less than 15% of the dwelling units
included in the development plan.
(4) To encourage flexibility of housing density, design, and type in
accord with the purposes of this section, gross residential density
may by varied from stage to stage. A gross residential density in
one stage which exceeds the permitted average gross residential
density for the entire planned residential development must be
offset by a gross residential density in a completed prior stage
which is less than the permitted average gross residential density
for the entire planned residential development, or there must be an
appropriate reservation of common open space on the remaining
land by a grant of easement or covenant in favor of South Whitehall
Township, which specifies the amount and, if necessary, the
location of the common open space.
(5) All streets, curbing, water systems, sewerage systems and
stormwater facilities are installed and approved by the Township
Engineer in the section to be developed prior to the sale of any lots
in said section.

30 days of such filing, grant such development plan final approval.
In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations
from the development plan given preliminary approval, the Board
of Commissioners may refuse to grant final approval and shall,
within 30 days from the filing of the application or final approval, to
§ 350-32 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-32
1:1136
advise the landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth in said
notice the reasons why one or more of said variations are not in

either:
(A) Refile his application for final approval without the variations
objected.
(B) File a written request with the Board of Commissioners that it
hold a public hearing on his application for final approval. If
the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action, he
may do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply
for final approval, or within 30 days if the time for applying for
final approval shall have already passed at the time when the
landowner was advised that the development plan was not in
substantial compliance. In the event the landowner shall fail to
take either of these alternate actions within said time, he shall
be deemed to have abandoned the development plan. Any such
public hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice within 30
days after request for the hearing is made by the landowner,
and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed
in this section for public hearings on applications for
preliminary approval. Within 30 days after the conclusion of
the hearing, the official review agency shall, by official written
communication, either grant final approval to the development

approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising under
this section, be in the form and contain the findings required
for an application for tentative approval set forth in this
section.
(15) A development plan or any part thereof which has been given final
approval shall be so certified without delay by the Board of
Commissioners and shall be filed on record within 30 days after
final approval has been granted in the office of the County
Recorder of Deeds before any development shall take place in
accordance therewith. Upon the filing of record of the development
plan, the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations otherwise applicable
to the land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto.
Pending completion within a period of two years of said planned
residential development or of that part thereof, as the case may be,
that has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of
said development plan or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be
made except with the consent of the landowner. Upon approval of a
final plat, the developer shall record the plat in accordance with the
provisions of Section 513(a) of the Pennsylvanian Municipalities
Planning Code and post financial security in accordance with
Section 509 of the Pennsylvanian Municipalities Planning Code.

final approval and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such
§ 350-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-32
1:1137
plan or the section thereof that has been finally approved, and
shall so notify the governing body in writing, or, in the event
the landowner shall fail to commence and carry out the planned
residential development or of that part thereof, within a period of
two years after final approval has been granted, no development
or further development shall take place on the property included
in the development plan until after the said property is reclassified
by enactment of an amendment to the South Whitehall Township
Zoning Ordinance in the manner prescribed for ouch amendments
in the South Whitehall Township Zoning Ordinance.
(k) Administration.
(1) Modification of provision of the plan: To further the mutual interest
of the residents of the planned residential development and of the
public in the preservation of the integrity of the development plan,
as finally approved, and to insure that modifications, if any, in the
development plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of the
said residents upon the provisions of the development plan, nor
result in changes that would adversely affect the public interest,
the enforcement and modification of the provisions of the
development plan as finally approved, whether those are recorded
by plat, covenant, easement or otherwise shall be subject to the
followings provisions:
(A) The provisions of the development plan relating to:
(i) The use, bulk, and location of buildings and structures;

residents of the planned residential development but only to
the extent expressly provided in the development plan and in
accordance with the terms of the development plan, and to that
extent said provisions whether recorded by plat, covenant,
easement or otherwise, may be enforced by law or equity by
said resident acting individually, jointly, or through an
organization designated in the development plan to act on
their behalf; provided, however, that no provisions of the
development plan shall be implied to exist in favor of residents
of the planned residential development except as to those
portions of the development plan which have been finally
approved and have been recorded.

1:1138
(C) All those provisions of the development plan authorized, to be
enforced by South Whitehall Township under this section may
be modified, removed, or released by South Whitehall
Township, except grants or easements relating to the service
or equipment of a public utility, subject to the following
conditions:
(i) No such modification, removal or release of the provisions
of the development plan by South Whitehall Township shall
affect the rights of the residents of the planned residential
development to maintain and enforce those provisions, at
law or equity, as provided in this section;
(ii) No modification, removal or release of the provisions of
the development plan by South Whitehall Township shall
be permitted except upon a finding by the South Whitehall
Township Board of Commissioners or its designated
agency, following a public hearing thereon pursuant to
public notice called and held in accordance with the
provisions of this section that the same is consistent with
the efficient development and preservation of the entire
planned residential development, does not adversely affect
either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across the
street from the planned residential development or the
public interest, and is not granted solely to confer a special
benefit upon any person.
(D) Residents of the planned residential development may, to the
extent and in the manner expressly authorized by the
provisions of the development plan, modify, remove or release
their rights to enforce the provisions of the development plan
but no such action shall affect the right of South Whitehall
Township to enforce the provisions of the development plan in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
(2) Appeals, violations and penalties.
(A) Any person, partnership or corporation, who or which has
violated the planned residential development provisions of any
ordinance enacted under this section or prior enabling laws
shall, upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement
proceeding commenced by the Township, pay a judgment of
not more than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable
attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result thereof. No
judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable
until the date of the determination of a violation by the district
justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the
judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to
the appropriate rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless
the district justice determining that there has been a violation
§ 350-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-32
1:1139
§ 350-33. through § 350-40. (Reserved)
further determines that there was a good faith basis for the
person, partnership or corporation violating the ordinance to
have believed that there was no such violation, in which event
there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation
until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a
violation by the district justice, and thereafter each day that
a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs and reasonable attorney fees collected for the
violation of planned residential development provisions shall
be paid over the Township whose ordinance has been violated.
(B) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or
interpreted to grant to any person or entity other than the
Township the right to commence any action for enforcement
pursuant to this section.

shown as a primary use in the Zoning District Schedule for the
district in which the use is located and the use is in conformance
with all other provisions of this chapter.
(2) Standards: No more than one primary use shall be permitted on a
lot, unless otherwise specified herein, such as but not limited to

(c) Temporary uses.
(1) Definition: It is hereby recognized that certain uses and activities
which might not otherwise be permitted by this chapter are
nevertheless such that their establishment and operation for a
limited period of time serves the public interest. Said uses involve a
nonpermanent use of a site and generally have a less restrictive set
of development standards due to the temporary nature of each such

chapter. Temporary uses include but are not limited to the
following: special events provided for the enjoyment of the public,
civic events in recognition of issues of public importance, seasonal
activities, commercial open houses, grand opening events and
similar temporary uses. All temporary uses, regardless of whether
permitted by right (with or without a zoning permit) under Section
12.46(a) or requiring approval of the Zoning Hearing Board under
Section 12.46(b), remain subject to compliance with all other
Township permitting and code requirements. Relief obtained from
any other applicable Township ordinance, resolution, code,
regulation, etc., does not alleviate the need to comply with this
chapter.
(d) Special exception uses.
(1) Definition: It is hereby recognized that certain uses may be
necessary to serve the needs and convenience of the Township, but
which uses may be adverse to the public health, safety and general

1:1141
welfare by reason of their inherent nature and/or operation and
therefore require special and proper consideration of existing and
probable future conditions and characteristics of the surrounding
area. Such uses are hereby declared to be "special exception uses"
and may be permitted upon application to and approval by the
Zoning Hearing Board provided said use is shown as a special
exception use in the Zoning District Schedule for the district in
which the use is located and subject to the following
considerations.
(2) Standards:
(A) The design, characteristics and operation of the use is such
that the public health, safety and general welfare will be

smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, air emissions, water
emissions and outdoor storage;
(K) Each special exception use shall adhere to the minimum
standards specified for the particular use by the applicable
regulations of this chapter;
(L) In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this chapter.
(e) Conditional uses.
(1) Definition: General standards. It is hereby recognized that the
establishment, maintenance and operation of certain uses may be
necessary to serve the needs and convenience of the public and the
Township, but that such uses may be adverse to the public health,
safety and general welfare by reason of their inherent nature and/
or operation and maintenance and, therefore, require special and
proper consideration of, inter alia, the proposed use, and
characteristics of the surrounding area. Such uses are hereby
declared to be conditional uses and may be permitted upon
application to and approval by the Board of Commissioners
provided said use is shown as a conditional use in the zoning

required for the principal use and/or building, unless otherwise
specified in § 350-24(c).
(2) An accessory building or portion thereof that is attached to the
principal building shall be considered as an integral part of said
principal building and not as an accessory building.

vehicular access to the lot) if:
(A) The entire frontage of that second parallel street is buffered, at
a minimum, at a fifteen-foot width and meeting the
requirements of § 350-42(b); and
(B) The accessory uses or buildings within that yard shall not
exceed a height of 12 feet.
(5) If the lot is bounded by more than one street in such a fashion as to
eliminate all side and rear yards or so as to leave side yards with
insufficient space to accommodate accessory uses or buildings, the
Zoning Hearing Board may designate a yard abutting a street for
the location of an accessory use or building taking into account the
impact upon adjacent properties, the nature of abutting streets,
and the existence of similar uses or buildings in the neighborhood.
(6) An accessory use or structure shall not be permitted to exist unless
the principal use exists on the same lot or an adjacent lot under
common ownership except as may be permitted for parking in

also comply with Act 161, 1980, Pennsylvania State Legislature,
amending the Airport Zoning Law of 1945 (2 P.S. § 1550).
(i) Illumination of private streets and driveways. The intent of the
following requirements is to limit the effects of sky glow, limit the
intensity of illumination on adjoining properties, and to limit the direct
view of the lamp source from adjoining properties. Adequate shielding
shall be provided to protect adjacent residential properties from the
glare of such illumination. Designs other than those meeting the
specific requirements outlined below will be considered, such as
indirect lighting of exterior canopies, as long as the design intent is
maintained.

locations of all lighting fixtures, either isofootcandle curve layouts
or point-by-point level indication, catalog information for the
fixture and pole used, mounting heights for fixtures, and a
foundation detail for the pole. The site plan shall also define the
surrounding properties indicating the zoning designation. In order
to determine that spill light does not exceed the level indicated in
Subsection (i)(6), the calculation grid for illumination levels shall
extend sufficiently into surrounding properties.
(6) The illumination level shall not exceed 0.5 horizontal footcandle on
any adjoining lot that is residentially zoned or contains a residential
use.
§ 350-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-42
1:1151

access portion of such highway shall be considered to be side
or rear yards, whichever is appropriate when applying the
setback and yard requirements of this chapter.
(B) An end dwelling unit of a group of twins or townhouses, where
the yard abutting the rear yard of the abutting unit shall be
designated as a rear yard for setback purposes.
(l) Measurements.
(1) Frontage on cul-de-sac lots. Due to the unique configuration of culde-
sac lots, the minimum frontage requirement may be satisfied at
the standard front building or use setback line, provided the length
of the right-of-way line equals at least 60% of the required
frontage.
(2) Limit on front setback. The provisions of this chapter shall not
require a single detached dwelling unit or a two-unit dwelling to
have a front yard setback that is more than 10 feet deeper than the

week of the cessation, expiration, or revocation of the permit.
Additionally, any public property (parks, road rights-of-way, etc.)
shall be cleaned of debris and rubbish which may have
accumulated by virtue of the temporary use. Failure to comply with
this provision will require Zoning Hearing Board approval for the
next event at the property that constitutes a temporary use
permitted by right and any such Zoning Hearing Board approval
will be contingent on the submittal of security in an amount and
form adequate to ensure that the Township can restore the
property to its preexisting condition, if necessary, at the completion
of the event. Additionally, if the temporary use (including
temporary structures) is not removed in a timely fashion, after
proper notification, the Township may remove the temporary use
(including structures) at the cost of the applicant. The applicant
shall reimburse the Township immediately following receipt of an
invoice noting the amount due. In the event the applicant fails to
reimburse the Township within 30 days of receipt of a written
invoice bill or if funds received from the applicant are insufficient
to fully reimburse the Township, the Township shall have the right,
after first providing written notice to the owner(s) of the land upon
which the temporary use was held, to invoice owner(s) for the cost
or deficiency. Each such invoice, together with interest and the cost
of collection thereof (including but not limited to reasonable fees
for legal counsel and court costs), in addition to a fee of 20% of the
expenses incurred by the Township as an administrative fee, shall
also be the joint and several personal obligations of the applicant
and the owner(s) of the property upon which the temporary use
was held. Upon filing by the Township, sums not reimbursed to the
Township shall become a lien on the property upon which the
§ 350-46 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-46
1:1164
temporary use was held. Liens shall be filed in the office of the
Prothonotary of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania and shall be collected
in the manner provided for by law for the collection of municipal
claims.
(4) Parking. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
contrary, temporary uses permitted by right shall not be required to
provide any specific amount of parking. Instead, parking provided
for a temporary use shall not block driveways or accessways.
Parking shall not be provided on private property without the prior
permission of the property owner. Further, no parking shall be
provided in any area designated as "no parking" by applicable
Township or state regulation.
(5) Other information. Applicant shall specify the dates and times for
the event and all other information which may be required by the
temporary use application form prescribed by the Township,
including the dates and times that set-up and tear-down will take
place, what provisions will be made for site security, sanitation,
trash removal, outdoor lighting or other electrical needs, and
information concerning proposed signage.
(6) Signs. Temporary signage is permitted for temporary uses
permitted by right in accordance with this subsection. Temporary
signs shall not exceed eight feet in height and shall not be
illuminated in any way. Electronic graphic display signs are not
permitted as temporary signage. A temporary use permitted by
right may display one sign (consisting of two sign faces) along each
front yard exposure of a property upon which a temporary use
permitted by right is allowed. Each sign face shall be limited to 32
square feet.
(b) Temporary uses requiring Zoning Hearing Board approval. Except for
temporary uses permitted by right described in Subsection (a) above, a
temporary use permit shall be issued by the Zoning Officer only after
said use receives special exception approval by the Zoning Hearing
Board pursuant to this subsection only, it being noted that temporary
uses need not comply with § 350-16(i) of this chapter. The applicant
must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that
the proposed temporary use complies with the following requirements:
(1) Compatibility. The proposed use is of such nature that it will not
exert a detrimental effect on neighboring properties and will
contribute to the general welfare, needs, and convenience of the
Township of South Whitehall and the general public. For purposes
of this section, no temporary use shall be permitted that will emit
smoke, dust, dirt, fumes, odors, noise, heat, glare, vibrations, radioactivity,
electrical disturbances, radio disturbances, or magnetic
disturbances beyond the bounds of the property in such a manner
as to be a nuisance or injurious to humans, animals, vegetation or
property of the adjoining or surrounding properties.
§ 350-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-46
1:1165
(2) Duration. The duration of the proposed temporary use shall be
established by specific dates as will, in the judgment of the Zoning
Hearing Board, serve the intended purpose. However, the duration
of such temporary use shall not exceed one week consisting of
seven consecutive days.
(3) Removal. Upon cessation or expiration of the temporary use, the
property upon which it is located shall be promptly cleaned and
substantially restored to the same condition as existed prior to
commencement of the Temporary Use, to a condition that is
otherwise in compliance with the terms of requirements of this
chapter (or as a lawful preexisting, nonconforming use) and all
other applicable Township ordinances within one week of the
cessation or expiration of the temporary use. Additionally, any
public property (parks, road rights-of-way, etc.) shall be cleaned of
debris and rubbish which may have accumulated by virtue of the
temporary use. If the temporary use (including temporary
structures) is not removed in a timely fashion, after proper
notification, the Township may remove the temporary use
(including structures) at the cost of the applicant utilizing the
security provided for in Subsection (b)(4) below. In the event that
the security is not sufficient to cover the cost of removal, the
applicant shall nevertheless remain responsible for the deficiency
between the amount of the security and actual cost of removal. The
applicant shall reimburse the Township immediately following
receipt of an invoice noting the deficiency and amount due. In the
event the applicant fails to reimburse the Township within 30 days
of receipt of a written invoice bill or if funds received from the
applicant are insufficient to fully reimburse the Township, the
Township shall have the right, after first providing written notice to
the owner(s) of the land upon which the temporary use was held, to
invoice the owner(s) for the cost or deficiency. Each such invoice,
together with interest and the cost of collection thereof (including
but not limited to reasonable fees for legal counsel and court
costs), in addition to a fee of 20% of the expenses incurred by the
Township as an administrative fee, shall also be the joint and
several personal obligations of the applicant and the owner(s) of
the property upon which the temporary use was held. Upon filing
by the Township, sums not reimbursed to the Township shall
become a lien on the property upon which the temporary use was
held. Liens shall be filed in the office of the Prothonotary of Lehigh
County, Pennsylvania and shall be collected in the manner provided
for by law for the collection of municipal claims.
(4) Security. Security shall be required by the Zoning Hearing Board in
an amount necessary to restore the property on which the
temporary use was located to its original condition and to a
condition that is otherwise in compliance with the requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance (or as a lawful preexisting, nonconforming
use). Security shall be returned to the applicant once the applicant
§ 350-46 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-46
1:1166
demonstrates that the property has been restored pursuant to
Subsection (b)(3) above.
(5) Parking. The applicant shall provide the Zoning Hearing Board with
all necessary information concerning parking to serve the
temporary use, including the primary access routes to the site and
available parking for the anticipated number of attendees. Special
traffic control personnel may be required for larger events. If the
event is proposed to take place on a property, the primary use of
which already includes an existing parking lot, there must be no
disruption of normal required parking, access, and traffic flow,
pedestrian accessways, sidewalks, or landscaped areas for the
primary use. Parking provided for a temporary use shall not block
private streets, driveways or access lanes. Parking shall not be
provided on private property without the prior permission of the
property owner. Further, no parking shall be provided in any area
designated as "no parking" by applicable Township or state
regulation.
(6) Additional information. The applicant shall provide the Zoning
Hearing Board with additional information requested by the Zoning
Hearing Board to demonstrate compliance with the special
exception criteria outlined in this Subsection (b) and to allow the
Zoning Hearing Board to adequately review the proposal and make
a decision concerning the proposed temporary use.
(7) Renewal. If a temporary use has previously received Zoning
Hearing Board approval under this Subsection (b), there has been
no material change in the temporary use, the applicant is the same
as that which previously received Zoning Hearing Board approval
for the subject temporary use, the temporary use is proposed at the
same property, and there has been no formal complaint filed by or
with the Township concerning the particular temporary use when
previously undertaken which has been substantiated by review of
the Zoning Officer, the Zoning Officer shall renew the temporary
use permit for the same duration of the temporary use as originally
set by the Zoning Hearing Board. It is noted that the Township
itself may be a complaining party, in which case no review by the
Zoning Officer is required to substantiate the complaint and the
temporary use shall not be subject to renewal as provided in this
subsection. Security required by the Zoning Hearing Board under
Subsection (b)(4) shall be provided for the renewed temporary use.
By way of example, if a temporary use received approval for one
week and the Zoning Hearing Board required security in the
amount of $5,000, the renewal shall be limited to a maximum
duration of one week for each event and security in the amount of
$5,000 shall be required for each event. A temporary use that is
subject to administrative renewal shall not take place more than
one time per year. Once approved by the Zoning Hearing Board, the
Zoning Officer shall renew a temporary use permit on a yearly basis
§ 350-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-46
1:1167
§ 350-47. Nonconforming structures, buildings, lots and uses.
for a total combined period of not more than five years from the
date of the initial Zoning Hearing Board approval. When five years
has passed from the initial Zoning Hearing Board approval, the
temporary use must again be approved by the Zoning Hearing
Board pursuant to the terms of this Subsection (b). By way of
example, if a temporary use first receives Zoning Hearing Board
approval on November 17, 2014, the same particular temporary
use shall be subject to administrative review for all permits issued
prior to November 16, 2019. Following November 16, 2019, if
a permit has not been issued for that year's temporary use, the
proposed temporary use is again subject to review and approval
hereunder by the Zoning Hearing Board. The five-year period is not
extended if the approved temporary use does not occur in any given
year. If a temporary use is again approved by the Zoning Hearing
Board, the Zoning Officer shall review renewal applications
pursuant to this subsection. The intent of this provision is that
no temporary use which requires Zoning Hearing Board approval
will be administratively approved for more than five years without
Zoning Hearing Board approval.
(A) The provisions of this Subsection (b)(7) shall be retroactive to
any temporary use which has received approval from the
Zoning Hearing Board on or after May 1, 2010.

1:1168
(A) The proposed expansion shall not create new dimensional
nonconformities or further increase existing dimensional
nonconformities for setbacks or height.

floor area or 25% of the cubical contents of the building(s)
occupied, or in the case of the use where a major portion is
conducted in the open, 25% of the service capacity or area
occupied.

strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any structure or building
or portion thereof which has been declared unsafe by the Building
Official.

Subsection (c)(1)(A) through (C) above, but is more than 40%
deficient in required width or minimum area (or more than 70%
deficient in the case of a permitted accessory storage building), a
permitted residential primary or accessory use may be erected
upon receipt of special exception approval from the Zoning Hearing
Board.
(3) The Zoning Hearing Board may grant variances for the erection or
alteration of a nonresidential use on any lot of record held in single
and separate ownership on the effective date of this chapter, or
amendments which rendered such lot nonconforming, and which
§ 350-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-47

(A) A major portion of the proposed use and the use it is to replace
is conducted within a building.
(B) The proposed nonconforming use is less detrimental to its
neighborhood and surroundings or general public welfare than
the use it is to replace. The Zoning Hearing Board shall take
into consideration all factors which might affect the public's
interest, including traffic generated, nuisance characteristics
such as emission of noise, odor, dust and smoke, fire hazards,
and hours and manner of operation.
(C) The proposed use to be substituted shall be permitted by right,
by special exception, or by conditional use in a zoning district
in which the existing nonconforming use would be a permitted
use or in a more restrictive zoning district than the district
where the nonconforming use would be permitted.
(D) The Zoning Hearing Board may attach any other reasonable
conditions to the approval.
(3) If a nonconforming use is subsequently changed to conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located, it shall not again be
altered or changed except in accordance with such regulations.

two years shall be deemed a permanent vacation and, thereafter,
the use shall not be reestablished except in conformance with the

transmitting surface area; and
[b] Used for customer end use only, for applications
such as but not limited to cell phones, television
and radio satellite reception, and wireless fidelity
internet reception.
[4] Modifications, replacements and co-locations to
preexisting towers or antennas that:
[a] Do not substantially change the physical
dimensions of the tower; provided, however that
any further increase in the height of a tower
which has already been substantially changed in
accordance with the provisions of this
§ 350-48(c)(5) shall not occur without Township
approval;
[b] Do not further increase the height of the tower
which has already been extended by more than

and preexisting antennas shall not be required to meet
the requirements of this § 350-48(c)(5)(E)(iii), General
requirements for new towers and antennas.
(iii) General requirements for new towers and antennas.
[1] Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may
be considered as either principal or accessory uses. A
different existing use of an existing structure on the
same lot shall not preclude the installation of an
antenna or tower on such lot. Unmanned equipment
cabinets, shelters, or structures shall be considered to
be accessory uses within such lot.
[2] Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the
installation of a tower or antenna on a certain lot
complies with zoning district regulations, including
but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage
requirements, and other such requirements, the
dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though
the antennas or towers may be located on leased
parcels within such lot. However, the minimum area
within such lot that shall be devoted exclusively to the
tower use shall be 2,500 square feet.
[3] Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an
antenna and/or tower where the applicant had
previously not owned, leased or operated an antenna
or tower shall provide to the Zoning Officer an
inventory of applicant's existing towers, antennas, or
sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either
within the jurisdiction of South Whitehall Township or
within five miles of the border thereof, including
specific information about the locations, height, and
type of each tower. The Zoning Officer may share such
information with other applicants applying for permits
under this § 350-48(c)(5), or other organizations
seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of
South Whitehall Township; provided, however, that
the Zoning Officer is not, by sharing such information,
in any way representing or warranting that such sites
are available or suitable.
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1198
[4] Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the
following requirements:
[a] Finish/paint: Towers shall either maintain a
galvanized steel finish or, subject to any
applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a
neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
[b] Design to blend: At a tower site, the design of the
buildings and related structures shall, to the
extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening, and landscaping that will blend them
into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
[c] Color to match structure: If an antenna is
installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical
equipment shall be of a neutral color that is
identical to, or closely compatible with, the color
of the supporting structure so as to make the
antenna and related equipment as visually
unobtrusive as possible.
[5] Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted,
unless required by the FAA or other applicable
authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen shall cause the least
disturbance to the surrounding views.
[6] Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower
setbacks and separation distances shall be calculated
and applied to facilities located in and outside South
Whitehall Township, irrespective of municipal and
county jurisdictional boundaries.
[7] Non-essential services. Towers and antennas shall be
regulated or permitted pursuant to this § 350-48(c)(5)
and shall not be regulated or permitted as essential
services, public utilities, or private utilities.
[8] Public notice. For purposes of this § 350-48(c)(5), any
permit application or hearing shall require public
notice to all abutting property owners, and to all
property owners of properties that are located within
the corresponding separation distance listed in
§ 350-48(c)(5)(E)(vi)[2][d][i], "Table 1 - Visual Isolation
Distances," in addition to any notice otherwise
required by law.
[9] Signs. No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or

Whitehall Township encourages the users of towers
and antennas to submit a single application for
approval of multiple towers and/or antenna sites
within the Township, or multiple users on the same
tower.
[12] Maximum height. The height of any new tower shall
not exceed 150 feet in any event, including the grant
of a variance by the Zoning Hearing Board.

height of § 350-48(c)(5)(E)(iii)[12] if located on sites
permitted by § 350-48(c)(5)(E)(iv)[4][b], provided that
the applicant demonstrates that the monopole or
alternate tower structures will not significantly alter
the visual landscape. The monopole or alternate tower
structures shall be erected within a stand of trees that
will provide screening of at least 180° of horizontal
arc centered at the base of the tower or alternate
tower structures. The height of the surrounding
foliage is determined by the height of the tallest tree
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48

not occupy more than 20% of the roof area.
[4] Modified screening requirements: Any equipment
cabinet, shelter, or structure which is located on the
ground shall be screened in accordance with
§ 350-42(b), except that all "as-planted" heights shall
be six feet minimum, and any fence shall be eight-foot
minimum height [§ 350-42(e) notwithstanding];
provided that the screening need not be installed
across an access road or driveway entrance or
approach, as long as said entrance or approach does
not face or abut an existing residential use or building.
(ix) Financial security for maintenance and removal of
abandoned antennas and towers.
[1] Financial security for maintenance and removal of
tower. Before commencing any installation work, the
applicant shall post and maintain with the Township
financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the
costs to maintain the tower in accordance with this
chapter; and to remove and dispose of the tower and
base down to the ground surface, and to restore the
site to its previously existing condition. The amount of
the financial security shall be subject to approval by
the Township Engineer, and shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time to reflect changes in
costs. The form of the financial security shall be in
accordance with Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code ("MPC") Section 509(c) [53 P.S. § 10509(c)]. The
administration of the financial security shall be in
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48
1:1213
accordance with Sections 509 and 510 of the said
MPC, except that failure of the applicant (or its
successor) to furnish replacement or substitute
financial security at least 30 days before the
expiration of any financial security shall be sufficient
reason for the Township to withdraw the financial
security for this purpose.
[2] Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any
antenna or tower that is not operated, and for which
there is no intent or attempt to operate, for a
continuous period of time of 12 months shall be
presumed to be abandoned. The owner of such
antenna or tower shall remove the same within 90
days after receipt of written notice from South
Whitehall Township notifying the owner of such
abandonment. Failure to remove an abandoned
antenna or tower within said 90 days shall be
sufficient grounds for the Township to remove the
tower or antenna, at the owner's expense. If there are
two or more users of a single tower, then this provision
shall not become effective until all such users have
abandoned the tower or antenna.
(x) Nonconforming uses.
[1] Preexisting towers. Preexisting, nonconforming
towers shall be allowed to continue their use as they
presently exist. Routine maintenance (including
replacement with a new tower of like construction and
height) shall be permitted on such preexisting towers.
New construction other than routine maintenance on
a preexisting tower shall comply with the
requirements of this chapter.
[2] Rebuilding damaged or destroyed nonconforming
towers or antennas. Notwithstanding
§ 350-48(c)(5)(E)(ii)[3], bona fide nonconforming
towers or antennas that are damaged or destroyed
may be restored in like kind without having to meet
the separation requirements specified in
§ 350-48(c)(5)(E)(vi)[2][d]. The type, height, and
location of the restored tower shall be the same and
the intensity of the antenna array as the original
previously existing tower. Building permits to rebuild
the tower or antenna shall comply with the thenapplicable
building codes, and shall be obtained
within 90 days from the date the tower or antenna is
damaged or destroyed. If no permit is obtained or if
said permit expires, then the tower or antenna shall be

HISTORIC RESOURCE OWNER'S CONSENT
STATEMENT ("OWNER'S CONSENT") — A notarized
written statement to the Board of Commissioners, which
is signed by the property owner of record of the lot
containing an historic resource, consenting to the
application of the provisions of § 350-48(h)(3), provisions

("PRESERVATION EASEMENT") — A binding legal
agreement between a property owner and the Township

historic resource, and which shall be required of every
property owner who submits an owner's consent. When a
preservation easement is created, the owner of an historic
resource agrees to create and/or maintain certain
protections so as to achieve the preservation of the
historic nature of the historic resource. The preservation
easement may require the property owner to retain the
original facade while still allowing the property owner to
alter the interior of an historic structure. The preservation
easement shall be in a form prepared by the Township
Solicitor and satisfactory to the Township and shall be
recorded in the Lehigh County Clerk of Judicial Records,
Recorder of Deeds Division.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE — A structure that is listed on
the National Registry of Historic Places or designated by
resolution by the Township Board of Commissioners as
an historic structure by reason of its unique historical,
architectural, or patriotic interest or value.

National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the
nation's historic places worthy of preservation, authorized
by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and part
of a national program to coordinate and support public and
private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect America's
historic and archeological resources.
(iv) Applicability.
[1] The provisions of this § 350-48(h)(3) shall apply to all
historic resources or lots containing historic resources
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1258
within the Township provided the property owner
submits an owner's consent, which shall be executed
as a condition of land development approval, or, in the
event that the property owner is not proposing land
development, an owner's consent shall be executed
and submitted along with a building or zoning permit
application.
[2] The provisions of this § 350-48(h)(3) shall cease to be
applied to the historic resource and lot containing the

such as condemnation or other governmental action.
(v) General requirements. Should the owner of an historic
resource submit an owner's consent, the following
provisions apply to the lot containing the historic resource,
including a lot that has been consolidated or made part of
a coordinated development. Should the lot be subdivided,

the historic resource named in the owner's consent. More
than one historic resource may be named in an owner's
consent and more than one owner's consent may apply to a
given lot if the owner elects to provide an owner's consent
for each historic resource.
[1] Owner responsibilities.
[a] Legal protections.
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48
1:1259
[i] The owner of the lot on which the historic
resource is located shall execute and record a
preservation easement to guarantee
permanent protection of the historical
integrity of the historic resource.
[ii] The owner of the lot on which the historic
resource is located shall represent and
warrant in the preservation easement that no
judgment lien, construction lien, mortgage,
or other financial encumbrance of the
property exists that could adversely affect
(including possible divestiture) the
preservation easement, or, if such
encumbrance does exist, the holder of any
such lien, mortgage, or other financial
encumbrance that could adversely affect the
Township's rights granted under the
preservation easement shall consent to the
granting of the preservation easement, and
agree by separate instrument, to subordinate
or partially release its rights in the property
to the extent necessary to permit the
Township to enforce the purposes of and its
rights under the preservation easement in
perpetuity and to prevent any modification or
extinguishment of the preservation easement
by the exercise of any rights of the holder of
the lien, mortgage or other financial
encumbrance.
[iii] The preservation easement shall be
submitted to the Township accompanied by
an opinion of record title or such other
evidence of lien priority as required by the
Township in its sole discretion, to confirm the
status of the preservation easement in first
lien position.
[b] Maintenance of the historic resource. An historic
resource shall be maintained so as to prevent the
loss of historic material and the deterioration of
important character defining details and features,
except for loss caused by acts of God such as fire,
sinkholes, or earthquakes, or other circumstances
beyond the owner's control such as condemnation
or other governmental action. Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed so as to prevent the
ordinary repairs and maintenance of any historic
resource provided that such repairs or
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1260
maintenance do not result in a conspicuous
change in the design, form, proportion, mass,
configuration, building material, texture, location,
or external visual appearance of any historic
resource or part thereof, unless authorized by the
preservation easement.
[i] Security requirement. Should either the
property owner or the Township, in either of
their sole discretions, determine that
restoration work on an historic resource is
required at any time, the property owner
shall submit a statement prepared by a
registered architect or professional engineer
licensed by and in good standing in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania detailing the
type of restoration work to be performed and
the estimated cost. The statement prepared
by a registered architect or professional
engineer shall be submitted
contemporaneously with the owner's consent,
or if restoration work becomes necessary at
any point subsequent to the submission of the
owner's consent, the property owner shall
submit the statement at that time or upon
request by the Township.
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48
1:1261
{A} Where an historic resource requires
restoration work of a type
determined by a registered
architect or professional engineer,
the property owner shall be
required to enter into a security
agreement with the Township in a
form acceptable to the Township
Solicitor and post security prior to
performing any restoration work on
the external features of the historic
resource. The property owner shall
not be required to post security for
ordinary repairs and maintenance
but the Township may require the
property owner to post security for
internal restoration work to an
historic resource. The form of
security shall be a letter of credit,
a cash deposit, or any other form of
security acceptable to the Township
and shall be determined by the
terms of the preservation easement.
The amount of security shall be
110% of the estimated cost of the
restoration work to be performed
with the specific amount to be
determined by the terms of the
preservation easement.
{B} The requirement to post security is
being made to protect the Township
against loss in the event of failure
of the property owner to complete
restoration work. The Township has
the right to use any portion or all of
the security to remedy and resolve
any restoration work that the
property owner either left
unfinished or defective or any
damages resulting from the
property owner's work, if the
property owner fails to respond to
a Township request to complete
restoration work.
[ii] Municipal lien. If the property owner refuses
or fails to perform the necessary work to
restore and/or maintain the historic resource
as required by the provisions herein, the
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1262
Township may cause such restoration and/or
maintenance to be done, and the owner shall
reimburse the Township for all costs incurred
in doing the work, plus an administrative fee
equal to 20% of the work performed. The cost
of the work performed by the Township shall
constitute a lien against the property on
which the work is performed.
[c] Modifications to the historic resource. No
modifications to an historic resource that result in
the alteration of the distinguishing features or
historic character shall be permitted unless such
modifications are authorized by the preservation
easement or such modifications were necessitated
by acts of God or other circumstances beyond the
property owner's control.
[d] Demolition or removal of the historic resource.
The historic resource shall not be demolished by
the owner of the lot on which the historic resource
is located or by the owner's agents, employees,
representatives, contractors, successors and/or
assigns, either through direct action or through
neglect.
[e] Historical markers or plaques may be required by
the Township subject to the provisions stipulated
by the Township and the owner of the historic
resource and incorporated into the preservation
easement.
[2] Historic structure adaptive re-use incentives.
[a] Adaptive re-use as conditional uses. The following
additional uses of the historic structure, if not
permitted by right within the zoning district
within which the historic structure is located, may
be permitted by conditional use within the
historic structure only.
[i] Single dwelling unit.
[ii] Two-flat.
[iii] Bed-and-breakfast.
[iv] Business or professional office.
[v] Art or craft gallery (as retail sales).

1:1263
[vi] Mixed-use building (containing a mix of the
uses listed within this Subsection
(h)(3)(v)[2][a].
[b] With regard to uses permitted by Subsection
(h)(3)(v)[2][a] immediately above as conditional
uses, residential uses permitted as adaptive reuses
within nonresidential zoning districts shall
use the bulk criteria listed under the R-5 Medium
Density Residential Zoning District.
[c] With regard to uses permitted by Subsection
(h)(3)(v)[2][a] above as conditional uses,
nonresidential uses permitted as adaptive re-uses
within residential zoning districts shall use the
bulk criteria listed under the Neighborhood
Commercial NC Zoning District.
[d] With regard to uses permitted by Subsection
(h)(3)(v)[2][a] above as conditional uses, such
uses shall meet all requirements associated with
the use proposed.
[e] The criteria that shall be used in determining
whether a conditional use may be permitted, in
addition to the general criteria set forth at
§ 350-41(d), shall be the United States Secretary
of the Interior's Standards for Historic
Rehabilitation, 36 CFR § 67.7 applied in a
reasonable manner, taking into consideration
economic and technical feasibility. The standards
are as follows:
[i] A property shall be used for its historic
purpose or be placed in a new use that
requires minimal change to the character
defining characteristics of the building and its
site and environment.
[ii] The historic character of a property shall be
retained and preserved. The removal of
historic materials or alteration of features
and spaces that characterized a property
shall be avoided.
[iii] Each property shall be recognized as a
physical record of its times, place, and use.
Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural
features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1264
[iv] Most properties change over time; those
changes that have acquired historic
significance in their own right shall be
retained and preserved.
[v] Distinctive features, finishes, and
construction techniques or examples of
craftsmanship that characterize a property
shall be preserved and the applicant for
conditional use approval shall demonstrate
how the distinctive features, finishes, etc.,
shall be preserved.
[vi] Deteriorated features shall be repaired rather
than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall
match the old in design, color, texture, and
other visual qualities and, where possible,
materials. Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary,
physical, or pictorial evidence.
[vii] Chemical or physical treatments, such as
sandblasting, that cause damage to historical
materials shall not be used. The surface
cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
[viii] Significant archeological resources affected
by a project shall be protected and preserved.
If such resources must be disturbed,
mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
[ix] New additions, exterior alterations, or related
new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The
new work shall be differentiated from the old
and shall be compatible with the massing,
size, scale, and architectural features to
protect the historic integrity of the property
and its environment.
[x] New additions and adjacent or related new
construction shall be undertaken in such a
manner that if removed in the future, the
essential form and integrity of the historic
property and its environment would be
unimpaired.
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48
1:1265
[f] No proposed change shall conflict with the terms
of the recorded preservation easement.
[3] Historic structure complementary use incentives. As
an incentive to provide for historic resource
preservation, the following provisions shall apply to
new buildings or structures on a lot or in a
coordinated development where an historic resource
is located.
[a] Building height. The maximum permitted height
of a building is increased by 50% from the
provisions applicable to the underlying zoning
district. Any portion of a building with an
increased height shall have a setback of 400% of
the standard setback as measured from the
property line of the nearest residentially zoned
property to that portion of the building with the
increased height. The permitted height increase
only pertains to principal buildings, not structures
such as signs, billboards, cell towers and the like.
Traditional setbacks shall continue to apply to any
portion of the building or structure for which the
height is not increased.
[b] Building setback lines. Where the historic
structure is nonconforming as to required setback
distances from a public street, new buildings or
structures are permitted to utilize the historic
structure's nonconforming setback.
[c] Parking setback lines. Where existing parking
areas are nonconforming as to required setback
distances from a public street, new parking areas
may utilize the nonconforming setback distances
established by the nonconforming parking,
provided that under no circumstances may any
parking area encroach into the ultimate right-ofway
area of such street.
[d] Design standards. The design guidelines specified
herein are applicable to the construction of new
buildings and other structures proposed to be
built on the lot or in a coordinated development
on which an historic resource is located.
[i] Exterior wall face. All exterior wall faces shall
be covered by at least 50% primary masonry
product limited to brick, stone, or stucco. No
more than 50% of any exterior wall face may
be covered by stucco. Concrete masonry units
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1266
may be used as a building component, but not
as an exposed wall face.
[ii] No more than four materials (in addition to
glass) shall be used on the exterior walls of
any single new building or structure unless
other materials are approved by the Township
to allow for unanticipated architectural
features.
[iii] Roofing materials and design. Flat roofs shall
be prohibited except where parapets with a
minimum height of at least five feet are used
to screen flat roofs and rooftop equipment.

(i) Except during construction, logging, mining or
agricultural activities, or otherwise permitted within this
chapter, the use and operation, including parking, storage
or repair, of any motor vehicle, the use and operation of
which requires a license for either the vehicle or the
operator, on private property shall be restricted to areas
conforming with the requirements of §§ 350-42(d),
350-42(r), and 350-48(o)(2), or within an enclosed building
or structure. Off-street parking spaces, open air or indoor,
shall be provided with all uses as specified in this chapter.
The establishment of any off-street parking area having a
capacity of four or more vehicles shall be subject to the
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1294
issuance of a zoning permit and shall be in conformance
with all requirements of § 350-48(o)(2).
[1] Residential off-street parking servicing three or fewer
dwelling units shall comply with all regulations within
this section, as applicable, except for Subsections
(o)(2)(E)(iii), (iv), and (v) below.
[2] All off-street parking spaces, except those regulated
under Subsection (o)(2)(E)(i)[1] above, shall comply
will all regulations within this section, as applicable.
[a] No parking area requiring a permit per
§ 350-48(o)(2)(E)(i)[2] shall be located in the
required front yard of a dwelling unit, except
where such front yard or other restricted area has
been used for parking and has been established as
a nonconforming use, this use may continue. Any
alteration, remodeling or addition to such parking
area shall be approved by the Zoning Hearing
Board upon finding that there is no reasonable
alternative.
[b] Up to 50% of the off-street parking spaces
required of a principal use may be located on a lot
other than that lot which the principal use is
located on, so long as such spaces lie within 600
feet of such principal use and is not separated
from the principal use by a collector or arterial
street.
(ii) Spaces to be provided. The standards of this chapter shall
be deemed the minimum requirements of the Township
and it is hereby declared to be the intent of this subsection
that each and all uses shall provide sufficient space to
accommodate the vehicles of all persons expected to be
employed or otherwise visit or occupy the premises in
question.
[1] The types of off-street parking spaces to be provided
for each use and establishment shall be for standard,
large and oversize spaces; the specifications for each
are set forth in Subsection (o)(2)(E)(iii) below. The
proportion of large spaces to be provided to standard
spaces to be provided is one to 150, with fractions
rounded down to the nearest whole number. For the
purposes of this § 350-48(o)(2), the term "spaces"
refers to standard spaces, unless otherwise specified.
Requirements for standard spaces are calculated first,
and then calculations for large and oversized spaces
are based upon those standard space calculations.
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48
1:1295
Large and oversized spaces are not to be included
in the standard space requirements of this section. If
a large space is specified for a particular use under
Subsection (o)(2)(E)(ii)[2] below, that number is added
to the number required within this Subsection
(o)(2)(E)(ii)[1]. The proportion of oversize spaces to
be provided to standard spaces to be provided is one
to 300, with fractions rounded down to the nearest
whole number. Unless otherwise specified, references
to parking spaces in Subsection (o)(2)(E)(ii)[2] below
refer to standard parking spaces.
[2] The number of off-street parking spaces to be
provided for each use and establishment shall be
sufficient to accommodate the vehicles of the use, its
employees and customers or visitors but not less than
the aggregate of the following:
[a] Commercial general rule: 1.0 space for each 200
square feet of total floor area.
[b] Industrial general rule: 1.0 space per employee on
the largest two shifts (or largest shift, if there is
no more than one shift) or 1.0 space per 1,000
square feet of total floor area, whichever is
greater; plus 1.0 oversized space for every five
loading docks (or fraction thereof), and 1.0
(trailer) spaces (55 feet by 10 feet in size) for
every five loading docks (or fraction thereof). The
area serving the loading dock does not count as a
parking or container space, but does count
toward the required off-street loading zones.
[c] Public assembly general rule: 1.0 space for each
three permanent seats, plus 1.0 space per 50
square feet of any additional room used for the
assembly of the general public, if applicable,
excluding lobbies, vestibules and similar areas.
[3] When the computation of the number of required
parking spaces results in a fraction, such fractions
shall be resolved to the next highest whole number.
[4] Where a building contains a number of uses or
activities, the required off-street parking shall be the
aggregate, sum of that which would be required for
each use individually.
[5] The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance to the
above requirements when it is documented to the
Board's satisfaction that the requirements would
result in unneeded parking. Sufficient area shall be
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1296
reserved, however, to meet these requirements in full,
and the Board of Commissioners may require partial
or complete enlargement up to these standards as
conditions indicate such enlargement is warranted.
[6] The collective provision of off-street parking by two or
more buildings or uses located on adjacent industrial
or commercial district lots is permitted, provided
there is a recorded right for the adjacent properties to
continue using those facilities so long as either use or
building continue to exist and that the total of such
facilities shall not be less than the sum required of the
various buildings or uses computed separately.
(iii) Design and construction.
[1] Design standards.
[a] Indented parking, i.e., creating parking spaces by
indenting the curb line or right-of-way of a street
or by traversing said curb line is hereby
prohibited.
[b] No parking area for five or more vehicles shall be
permitted which will cause vehicles to back onto a
collector or arterial street, except in RR-3, RR-2
or R-R Districts or where land is being used for
agricultural, horticultural, nursery, including
raising and keeping of farm animals.
[c] Parking areas shall be designated so that each
vehicle may proceed to and from its parking space
without requiring the movement of any other
vehicle.
[d] All parking areas shall be adequately graded,
drained, paved with a hard surface such as
macadam, concrete, etc., and maintained
annually. Adequate provision satisfactory to the
Township shall be made to channel, divert and/or
retain stormwater runoff to prevent or minimize
flooding both upstream and downstream. Such
provisions shall take into account the effect of
future development within the watershed.
[e] All parking areas shall be confined within
Portland cement concrete curbing, guardrails, or
anchored bumper blocks to prevent or discourage
parking or traveling off the paved area. Portland
cement concrete curbing may also be specified
where it is necessary to control stormwater
runoff.
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48
1:1297
[f] All parking areas shall be clearly marked for
vehicle spaces.
[g] No parking area shall provide for more than 25
vehicle spaces in any row without being separated
by planting strips at least 10 feet in width or
planting aisles with a minimum area of 162
square feet.
[h] Parking areas exceeding 30,000 square feet in
commercial and industrial districts shall be
provided with curbing, and planter strips to
control traffic flow and to provide walkways for
pedestrian safety in the parking areas to the
satisfaction of the Township.

[4] Illumination. All parking areas, except those servicing
three or fewer dwelling units, shall be illuminated
adequately during the hours between sunset and
sunrise when the use is in operation in accordance
with the standards set forth in § 350-42(i) which
standards are also the applicable standards for
parking areas.
(iv) Setbacks required.
[1] The following setbacks are required for all parking
areas not entirely contained in a garage or building:

Greater than 8,000 50 25
[2] For purposes of this § 350-48(o)(2)(E)(iv), the size of
the parking area shall be the sum of all parking areas
that are not separated from each other by at least 50
feet at their closest point.
[3] The side and rear yard setbacks for parking areas
provided for commercial and/or industrial uses shall
be double that specified in this § 350-48(o)(2)(E)(iv)
when said parking area abuts the boundary line of a
residential district or the lot line of a residential use.
[4] The side and/or rear yard setbacks specified in
Subsection (o)(2)(E)(iv)[3] immediately above may be
omitted in commercial and industrial districts
between adjacent parking areas.
[5] The setbacks specified in this § 350-48(o)(2)(E)(iv) for
parking areas less than 8,000 square feet also shall
apply for parking areas greater than 8,000 square feet
where the lot on which the business office and parking
area exist:
[a] Is located in the Office Commercial (OC) Zoning
District; and
[b] The lot area does not exceed 2.0 acres.
[6] The side and rear yard setbacks specified in
Subsection (o)(2)(E)(iv)[3] above shall not be required
for a parking area in an Office Commercial (OC)
Zoning District where the subject lot has frontage on
an arterial road and the abutting lot either is (i)
developed with a commercial or industrial use, or (ii)
municipally owned. When the foregoing criteria are
met and the subject lot also abuts an existing
residential use, the side and rear yard setbacks
specified in Subsection (o)(2)(E)(iv)[3] above shall
continue to apply for that portion of the parking area
that abuts the existing residential use, but shall not
apply for the remainder of the parking area. As used in
this section, "abuts" and "abutting" shall mean that
the property containing the parking area physically
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1300
touches/adjoins the other lot, and shall not apply to
a circumstance where the other lot is separated by a
road from the subject lot containing the parking area.
[7] For uses utilizing the provisions of § 350-45(d), the
parking setbacks from the ultimate right-of-way line
listed in Subsection (o)(2)(E)(iv)[1] above may be
reduced by the same amount applied to the front yard
setback under § 350-45(d), notwithstanding any other
applicable subsections of this § 350-48(o)(2)(E)(iv).
[8] Residential parking spaces required by
§ 350-48(o)(2)(E)(i)[1] shall have no setback
requirements.
(v) Buffer strips, screening and landscaping. All improved offstreet
parking areas required or specified in this chapter
and not entirely contained in a garage or building shall:
[1] Have a buffer strip and screening between it and any
adjacent residential lot in accordance with
§ 350-42(b). Such screening shall be augmented as
necessary to prevent the glare of headlights from
shining on adjacent residential properties.
[2] Provide one shade tree for every 10 parking spaces
located in a planned manner within or adjacent to the
parking lot areas. Where more than 50% of a parking
area is effectively precluded from planting shade trees
because of an overhead power line electric utility
restriction, the foregoing shade tree requirement shall
not apply to those spaces located within the area that
is restricted by such electric utility requirement;
provided, however, that substitute plantings as may be
deemed to be appropriate by the Township may be
required to the extent they are not in conflict with the
utility restriction. The Township shall have the right to
confirm specific landscaping restrictions with the
utility company.
[3] The area between the parking area and a public street
shall be landscaped to include plantings at least 30
inches in height. Said plantings shall be at least 50%
evergreen shrubbery and shall average at least one for
every 10 feet of frontage.
[4] The planting and screening required by this section
shall not be located so as to obstruct vision at
intersections of driveways and streets.
(vi) Maintenance. All improved parking areas shall be
maintained in good condition. Pavement shall be patched,
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48
1:1301
replaced or resurfaced and snow or ice removed in such a
manner that at least 85% of the parking area may be used
at all times without risk of danger to persons or vehicles
using said area. The period of time that the 100% of the
parking spaces is not available shall not exceed 48 hours
for any given seven-day period. Parking areas shall not
be used for storage of materials or goods. Litter, paper,
junk, cinders, mud, etc., shall be removed as frequently
as necessary to prevent a nuisance to persons using the
facility or to adjoining property owners.
(vii) Parking canopies. Structures that are open on all vertical
sides and designed to shade or provide some overhead
cover from the elements for vehicles parking in designated
parking spaces may be provided and shall conform to the
following regulations: [Added 9-20-2017 by Ord. No.
1024342]
[1] Parking canopies shall conform to the appropriate
parking setbacks.
[2] Parking canopies (including any attached structures
or appurtenances) shall be no taller than 25 feet above

Subsection (o)(2)(E)(viii).
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1302
principal use shall not be counted as off-street parking
for that use.
[3] Each parking garage shall be so designed that each
vehicle may proceed to and from its parking space
without requiring the movement of any other vehicle.
[4] The architectural design and materials used in the
construction of parking garages shall be similar to and
compatible with the design and materials used in the
construction of the principal buildings.

a safe condition, so that sufficient drainage shall be
provided so as to prevent water pockets or undue erosion
with all grading and drainage such that runoff water
leaves the entire property at the original, natural drainage
points, and that the area drainage to any one such point is
not increased except as may be approved in the
reclamation plan.
(xii) Where topsoil is removed, sufficient arable soil shall be set
aside for respreading over the excavated area.
(xiii) Upon replacement of the topsoil, trees, shrubs, legumes,

(E) Additional regulations: Where so noted in Subsection (r)(4)(C)
above, a recreation field shall be permitted by special
exception subject to the following minimum standards and
criteria, in addition to those set forth in § 350-41(d):
(i) Parking.
[1] Such uses shall require the submission of evidence
that the facility provides sufficient off-street parking
to accommodate the maximum capacity of the facility.
[2] Such uses shall require the submission of evidence
that the facility provides sufficient traffic queuing area
to prevent traffic entering or exiting the facility from
queuing on public streets.
(ii) Recreation field lighting. The illumination of recreation
fields shall meet the following requirements, in order to
limit the effects of sky glow, limit the intensity of
illumination on adjoining properties, and to limit the direct
view of the lamp source from adjoining properties.
[1] General requirements:
[a] Luminaires should be selected with an optical
system and proper orientation such that the
defined beam does not extend beyond the sports
or recreation facility.
[b] Ensure that proper mounting heights are
selected, with the top of the field angle of the
luminaire a minimum of 10° below the horizontal
plane projected from the luminaire. Low
luminaire mounting heights increase glare and
have a negative impact on the illumination of the
field, and may be objectionable to the players or
participants on the field. Greater setback and
higher mounting heights will produce an effective
shield from viewing the direct source of
illumination.
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48
1:1321
[c] Internal or external glare shields shall be utilized
on all luminaries. The impact of the shields must
be properly reflected in the point-by-point
calculations.
[d] Low reflectance colors shall be used on
surrounding critical surfaces to minimize the
impact of reflected light and resultant sky glow.
[2] Specific requirements:
[a] The aiming angles of the luminaires shall be such
that the arc tube of the lamp is not directly visible
from an adjoining property.
[b] Illumination levels on adjoining properties shall
not exceed 0.5 footcandles horizontal, and 1.0
vertical footcandles, measured at a height of four
feet zero inches above grade.
[c] A site plan must be submitted to the Township
Engineer for review and recommendation, and for
approval by the Township, and shall include a
general layout of the site indicating field layouts,
locations of all lighting standards, point-by-point
level indication, catalog information for the
fixtures and poles used including number of
luminaires, arrangement of luminaires, and
aiming angles of luminaires. The site plan shall
also define the surrounding properties indicating
the zoning designation and grading. In order to
determine that spill light does not exceed the
levels indicated in Subsection (r)(4)(E)(ii)[2][b],
the calculation grid for illumination levels shall
extend sufficiently into surrounding properties.
[d] In general, illuminance criteria should not exceed
the values established in RP-6-01 based on the
sport and class of the field. Special consideration
may be given to exceed these values when
television broadcasting is proposed on a regular
basis. Requests will be evaluated on a case-bycase
basis with special consideration of the
impact on surrounding properties.
[e] Automatic controls shall be incorporated into the
design to ensure the luminaries are extinguished
no later than 11:00 p.m. Manual override control
should be included to allow for earlier
extinguishing of the luminaries at the conclusion
of the function. Conversely, the manual override
control shall allow for illumination beyond 11:00
§ 350-48 SOUTH WHITEHALL CODE § 350-48
1:1322
p.m., if needed, to provide illumination for the
attendees to exit the premises, for the unexpected
circumstance in which the event has not
concluded by 11:00 p.m.
[f] Degree or factory preset timing is the preferred
method for fixture installation and aiming. If
target aiming is to be performed, the aiming plan
shall be submitted to the Township for review to
ensure the field-aiming matches the submitted
design criteria.
(5) 350-48(r)(5) Recreational clubhouse.
(A) Definition: A use, the primary function of which is to provide

(9) 350-48(s)(9) Short-stay medical center.
(A) Definition: An in-patient or out-patient elective surgery and/or
medical or dental treatment facility, not providing emergency
trauma care services, and having at least five beds but no more
than 30 beds for in-patient care, at which the average length of
in-patient stay does not exceed 72 hours. The term "short-stay
medical center" shall not include any facility in which is
conducted the housing of the criminally insane or which
provides treatment or housing of persons actively charged with
or serving a sentence after being convicted of a felony. A shortstay
medical center shall be permitted to include transitional
skilled nursing services as an ancillary use, so long as such
services are located on the same lot as the short-stay medical
center or within a coordinated development of which the shortstay
medical center is part thereof, and so long as the number
of beds allocated to the skilled nursing services does not
exceed 30 beds. In addition, the average length of stay for
skilled nursing patients in a short-stay medical center shall not
exceed 21 days. The skilled nursing services offered in
§ 350-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-48
1:1339
connection with the short-stay medical center shall include
professionally supervised nursing care and related medical and
other health services provided for a period exceeding 24 hours
to an individual not in need of hospitalization, but whose needs
are above the level of room and board and can only be met in
a long-term care nursing facility on an inpatient basis because
of age, illness, disease, injury, convalescence or physical or
mental infirmity. The term "skilled nursing services" includes
the provision of inpatient services that are needed on a daily
basis by the resident, ordered by and provided under the
direction of a physician, and which require the skills of
professional personnel, such as registered nurses, licensed
practical nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists,
speech pathologists or audiologists.
(i) For purposes of this definition, the average length of stay
shall be calculated by first adding the aggregate number of
hours or days, as applicable, that all patients have been
admitted in the short-stay medical center at any given
point in time. This aggregate sum of hours or days, as
applicable, shall then be divided by the number of patients
then admitted in the short-stay medical center to
determine the average length of stay. By way of example, if
10 patents are currently admitted into the short-stay
medical center's transitional skilled nursing services
component and the 10 patients have been admitted for an
aggregate total of 93 days, the average length of stay at
that point is 9.3 days. The average length of stay is
anticipated to be a "rolling" figure and change from day to
day as patients are admitted and discharged from the
short-stay medical center.

advertise, inform, announce or direct, and which is designed to
attract the eye and bring the attention of the public or portion
thereof to the said advertisement, information, announcement
or direction or to the object of the said advertisement,
