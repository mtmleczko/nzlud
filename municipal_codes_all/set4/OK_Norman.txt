(a)  The Code of ordinances as prepared by the City Legal Department and published by the Municipal Code Corporation of Tallahassee, Florida, pursuant to Contract K-7576-2, consisting of Chapter 1 to 22 is hereby adopted and enacted for the City of Norman, Oklahoma, and shall go into effect immediately upon the passage and approval of this ordinance and at the same time this ordinance goes into effect. 
(b)  The Code may be cited as "Code of the City of Norman, Oklahoma, 1976" or by short title "Code of the City". When a change or changes have been prepared and inserted in said Code, as provided hereinbelow, the words "as amended" may be added to the above citation or title when referring to the Code as amended. 
Section 2. - Charter of the City included. 
    The Charter of the City of Norman, Oklahoma, and an index to that Charter is included within the Code for the convenience of the public. 
Section 3. - Permanent and general ordinances not included, are repealed. 
    All ordinances and parts of ordinances of a permanent and general nature passed prior to December 31, 1975, and in effect at the time the Code is adopted but not included in the Code, are hereby repealed as of the time when the Code goes into effect. Ordinances passed on or after December 31, 1975, shall not be repealed or amended by the adoption of the Code or the passage of this ordinance. 
Section 4. - Repeal of ordinances not to affect any offense or act done prior to the time Code goes into effect, etc. 
    The repeal of ordinances and parts of ordinances of a permanent and general nature by the above section of this ordinance shall not affect any offense committed or act done, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any contract, right to obligation established prior to the time when said ordinances and parts of ordinances are repealed. 
Section 5. - Temporary or special ordinances continue in effect, although omitted from the Code. 
    The continuance in effect of temporary or special ordinances and parts of ordinances, although omitted from the Code, shall not be affected by such omission therefrom; and the adoption of the Code shall not repeal or amend any such ordinance or parts of any such ordinance.

Section 6. - Notes inserted for convenience. 
    Notes indicating sources of sections, giving other information, or referring to the statutes or to other parts of the Code, are inserted in the Code, and may be inserted in supplements to the Code. Such notes are for the convenience of the public and shall have no legal effect. 
Section 7. - Certified copies of the Code. 
(a)  The City Clerk shall carefully examine at least one copy of the Code adopted by this ordinance to see that it is a true and correct copy of the Code. Similarly, after each change or supplement has been prepared, printed, and inserted in the Code, the City Clerk shall carefully examine at least one copy of the Code as amended to see that it is a true and correct copy of the Code as amended. The City Clerk shall then insert a certificate in the front of the said true and correct copy or copies of the Code certifying substantially that the copy is a true and correct copy of the Code of ordinances of the City including all permanent and general ordinances passed or adopted prior to the date to which the Code has been brought up to date and still in effect as of that date. All pages of the Code and the certificate shall be bound together by running a one-piece ribbon through holes in the inner margins of all the sheets and tying the ribbon in a secure knot. The ends of the ribbon shall then be placed under an adhesive seal wafer and fastened to the certificate by the wafer. The City Clerk shall sign the certificate and shall seal it with the Seal of the City, impressing the seal on the wafer and the sheet to which it is attached. 
(b)  A copy of the Code as originally adopted or as amended, so bound, certified, and sealed, shall constitute the permanent and general ordinances of the City as of the date indicated in the certificate, and shall be so accepted by the courts of law, administrative tribunals, and others concerned. 
(c)  One copy of the Code so bound, certified, and sealed most recently, shall be kept in the office of the City Clerk at all times, and may be inspected by any interested person at any time during regular office hours; but may not be removed from the City Clerk's office or possession except upon proper order of a court of law. 
Section 8. - Permanent and general ordinances passed on and after December 31, 1975. 
    Ordinances and parts of ordinances of a permanent and general nature passed or adopted on and after December 31, 1975, may be passed or adopted either (1) in the form of amendments to the Code of ordinances adopted by this ordinance, or (2) without specific reference to the Code. But, in either case, all such ordinances and parts of ordinances shall be deemed amendments to the Code; and all of the substantive permanent and general parts of such ordinances and changes made thereby in the Code shall be inserted and made in said Code whenever authorized or directed by motion, resolution, or ordinance of the City Council as provided hereinafter. 
Section 9. - Typographical corrections and omissions. 
    Some typographical errors and omissions escaped detection in the original recodification of specific Chapters. Based upon a review of pre-codification materials, these changes are hereby corrected as herein enumerated: 
(a)  Sec. 13-1407(g) had read: 
"No mobile home shall occupy a travel trailer space, a travel trailer occupy a mobile home space, or for any mobile home or travel trailer to be located in a park unless in a designated mobile home or travel trailer space." 
Sec. 13-1407(g) is amended within this adopted Code of the City to read: 
"No mobile home shall occupy a travel trailer space, no travel trailer shall occupy a mobile home space, and no mobile home or travel trailer shall be located in a park, unless in a designated mobile home or travel trailer space." 
(b)  Sec. 13-1407 (i), first sentence, had read: 
"Driveways must have obstructed access to a public street or highway." 
That first sentence of Sec. 13-1407(i) is amended within this adopted Code of the City to read: 
"Driveways must have unobstructed access to a public street or highway." 
(c)  Sec. 13-2703 (c) had read: 
"After the slaughtering of a diseased animal or the examination of the carcass shall, immediately after such slaughtering or examination, be thoroughly cleaned and subjected to an approved bactericidal process." 
Sec. 13-2703 (c) is amended within this adopted Code of the City to read: 
"After the slaughtering of a diseased animal or the examination of the carcass, all equipment coming into contact with such diseased animal or carcass shall, immediately after such slaughtering or examination, be thoroughly cleaned and subjected to an approved bactericidal process." 
(d)  Sec. 16-609, first sentence, had read: 
"No contractor shall construct or excavate upon or adjacent to any street, alley, sidewalk, or public ground in the City, to maintain substantial guard rails and barriers around such work or excavation in such manner as to protect pedestrians, animals, and vehicles using the street, alley, or walk." 
That first sentence of Sec. 16-609 is amended within this adopted Code of the City to read: 
"No contractor shall construct or excavate upon or adjacent to any street, alley, sidewalk, or public ground in the City, without maintaining substantial guard rails and barriers around such work or excavation in such manner as to protect pedestrians, animals, and vehicles using the street, alley, or walk." 
Section 10. - Amendments to the Code. 
(a)  Sec. 5-104(d) (2) read: 
"Franchise public utility companies, public service companies, all governmental entities, corporate entities created by and administered under the laws of the State of Oklahoma, and the City of Norman shall be exempt from permit fees, but not from acquiring permits..." 
A close review of the phrase "corporate entities created and administered under the laws of the State of Oklahoma", is specifically felt to be overbroad and lends itself to litigation. Sec. 5-104(d)(2) is therefore amended within this adopted Code of the City by deleting that overbroad phrase. 
(b)  Sec. 13-108 (1) had provided that the pawnbroker's license was $100.00 per annum. Subsequent to the passage of the applicable ordinance, the Oklahoma State Legislature provided for a $50.00 limitation which could be charged as a regulation fee by municipalities upon the pawnbrokerage businesses. Sec. 13-108 (1) is amended within the adopted Code of the City to reflect this legislative limitation. 
(c)  Sec. 13-1502 had provided that a drilling applicant, prior to the issuance of any permit, must deposit with the City Clerk a cash amount of $2,000.00 as security, and that such $2,000.00 was not returnable until restoration of the land's surface. Experience within the trade indicated that this produced a hardship upon applicants. Therefore, Sec. 13-1502 is amended to provide a $2,000.00 surety bond to be posted upon completion of the drilling and before the restoration of the land's surface. 
Section 11. - Change to be prepared embodying permanent and general ordinances. 
(a)  By contract or by City personnel, a change or supplement to the Code adopted by this ordinance shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the City Council. A change to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the City Council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the change, and all changes made thereby in the Code shall also include all the amendments to the City Charter adopted during this period. The pages of a change shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code, and where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete; and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be up to date to the date to which the Code is being brought up to date. 
(b)  When preparing a change, the codifier (meaning in this ordinance, the person, agency, or organization authorized to prepare the change) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the change, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings, and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the change and may make changes in such catchlines, headings, and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter", "this article", "this division", etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and, 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the change or already embodied in the Code. 
(c)  Each change shall include a new title page for the Code; and the title shall include a notation below the title indicating that the Code contains all permanent and general ordinances and parts of ordinances passed prior to the date to which the Code is brought up to date and still in effect. The words "as amended" may be added to the title after the date "1976". 
(d)  With prior approval of the City Attorney or City Council, a change may include new materials in appendixes to the Code for convenience of persons using the Code. 
(e)  Every change shall include an index supplement if needed to index the materials in the change or changes, or a new index to the Code. 
(f)  In preparing every change, the codifier shall be subject to the direction and supervision of the City Attorney. 
(g)  After every change has been prepared and printed, a number of copies of the change, equal at least to the number of copies of the Code still in existence, shall be deposited in the office of the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall deliver by mail or otherwise, those supplements to those holders of the Code who are current subscribers to the Code Supplement Service. Immediately after receiving the copies of a change, the City Clerk shall cause the change to be properly inserted and made in all copies of the Code still in his possession. 
Section 12. - Penalty for altering or tampering with Code. 
    Any person convicted of altering, changing, or amending the Code adopted by this ordinance except in the manner prescribed by this ordinance, or who is convicted of altering or tampering with said Code in any manner so as to cause the provisions of said Code to be misrepresented thereby, shall be punished by a monetary fine in an amount no less than $20.00 nor more than $100.00. 
Section 13. - Sale of copies of the Code. 
    The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to sell copies of the Code to the public at prices approximating the City's cost of publication. 
Section 14. - Emergency. 
    It being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, an emergency is hereby declared to exist by reason whereof this ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its adoption as by Jaw provided. 
ADOPTED this 8th day of June, 1976.

(Ord. No. 0-7475-35) 
Sec. 2-103. - Council ethics. 
(a)  Members of the Council shall refrain from: 
(1)  Making use of special knowledge or information obtained from their position before that knowledge or information is made available to the general public; 
(2)  Making decisions in which a Councilmember has a pecuniary interest or actual conflict as defined herein; 
(3)  Using their influence as Councilmembers in attempts to secure contracts, zoning, or other favorable municipal action for a person or entity with whom a Councilmember has a pecuniary interest or actual conflict as defined herein; 
(4)  Actions benefiting special interest groups at the expense of the City; 
(5)  Appointments of persons with whom a Councilmember has a pecuniary interest or actual conflict, as defined herein, to appointive boards and commissions; 
(6)  Willful violations of Section 2-103; 
(7)  Conflict of interest. 
a.  In order to assure independence and impartiality on behalf of the common good, no elected City Official shall use his official position to influence government decisions in which he has a pecuniary interest or in which he has an organizational responsibility that may give the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
b.  Violations of the conflict of interest provisions set forth herein shall be handled in a manner consistent with the City Charter and applicable state law. 
c.  Violations of the conflict of interest provisions set forth herein shall be handled in a manner consistent with the City Charter and applicable state law. 
(b)  Members of the Council shall: 
(1)  Conduct themselves so as to bring credit upon the City, setting an example of good, ethical conduct for all citizens of the community; 
(2)  Comply with all lawful actions, directives and orders of duly constituted municipal officers as such may be issued in the normal and lawful discharge of their duties; and 
(3)  Insuring within their power, the equal and impartial enforcement of all laws, without respect to race, creed, color, sex, or the economic or social position of individual citizens. 
(c)  Definitions. 
(1)  Actual conflict: A set of circumstances wherein an elected City Official would be required to take an action or make a decision regarding a cause, proceeding, application or any other matter where he or she holds a direct benefit, detriment, or employment consequence. 
(2)  Benefit, detriment, or employment consequence: A benefit, detriment, or employment consequence to: 
a.  The public official; 
b.  A member of his or her immediate family; or 
c.  A business or organization in which the official has a pecuniary interest or actual conflict as defined herein. 
(3)  Confidential information: Privileged statements or communications, whether expressed or implied, oral or written, between an elected City Official, City of Norman employees, and the City Attorney; work product of the City Attorney's office; and City of Norman records, documents, and other information not subject to public disclosure and dissemination by law. 
(4)  De minimis: A pecuniary benefit that does not exceed the value of one hundred dollars ($100.00) incidental to personal, professional, or business contacts and involving no substantial risk or undermining official impartiality. 
(5)  Elected City Official: The Mayor and any member of City Council. 
(6)  Gift: The transfer of anything of economic value, regardless of the form, without adequate and lawful consideration. The term "gift" does not include the solicitation, acceptance, receipt or regulation of political campaign contributions regulated in accordance with the laws of the State of Oklahoma. 
(7)  Pecuniary interest: The expectation of a financial benefit, detriment or employment consequence. This also includes any pecuniary interest of a member of the official's immediate family. A person has a pecuniary interest in an organization in which that person has a five (5) percent ownership interest or greater or valued over twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00). A person has a pecuniary interest in a decision if a financial interest of that person will vary with the outcome of the decision. This includes officials with real property interests abutting a subject property. 
(8)  Potential conflict: A set of circumstances wherein an elected City Official would be required to take an action or make a decision regarding a cause, proceeding, application or any other matter where he or she may have an indirect benefit, detriment, or employment consequence; this type of situation calls into question the official's objectivity or independence, but the effect of this type of conflict is not certain. 
(d)  Conflict of interest. 
(1)  Pecuniary interest or actual conflict. An elected City Official shall not participate in any official action if he or she has a pecuniary interest or an actual conflict. Prior to the beginning of discussion on the issue, the elected City Official shall disclose his or her pecuniary interest or actual conflict. Then, the elected City Official shall not participate in either the vote or the discussion relating to the issue. City of Norman Code Section 2-108 requires that any Councilmember barred from voting must leave his or her Council chair and shall not participate during the debate of such item. 
(2)  Potential conflict. If the elected City Official has a potential conflict, that elected City Official may engage in both the vote and discussion, but the potential conflict must be disclosed prior to participation. 
(3)  Exceptions. 
a.  If the elected City Official's financial interests are included within a whole class of citizens, such as property taxpayers, an exception is made to allow the official to vote. This only applies in case of votes or decisions in which the elected City Official has a personal interest or pecuniary interest no greater than that of other persons generally affected by the decision, such as adopting a bylaw or setting a tax rate. 
b.  If an elected City Official discloses an actual conflict on the record, that elected City Official shall disqualify himself or herself from participating in any decision or vote relating thereto, unless following such a disclosure, a majority of the remaining members of Council, determine by official action at a public meeting, that such conflict of interest is de minimis. 
(4)  Discovery of conflict. The existence of an ethical issue often does not arise until a meeting is underway. Rather than risk an inadvertent violation, the safest course of action is simply to declare that a conflict of interest may exist that prevents an elected City Official from participating. As soon as an elected City Official realizes that a conflict of interest exists on a given matter, he or she must disclose the conflicting of interest on the record for the minutes. 
(e)  Duty to report. Elected City Officials have a duty to report in accordance with state law. Moreover, elected City Officials should never attempt to use their authority or influence for the purposes of intimidating, threatening, coercing, commanding, or influencing any person with the intent of interfering with that person's duty to disclose such improper activity. If an elected City Official believes that another elected City Official or citizen may have violated this policy, he or she may consult with the City Attorney's office. 
(f)  Gifts. Gifts must be refused or returned with a friendly but firm message that elected City Officials are not allowed to receive gifts. 
(1)  Oklahoma Statute Title 21, § 382 makes it a crime for any municipal officer or any employee of a political subdivision to corruptly accept or request a gift or gratuity, or a promise to make a gift, or a promise to do an act beneficial to such officer. If this happens, the officer or employee shall forfeit his office, be forever disqualified to hold any public office, trust, or appointment under the laws of the State of Oklahoma, and be guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment not exceeding ten (10) years or by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and imprisonment for not more than one (1) year. 
(2)  In addition, Article XVII, Section 5 of the Charter of the City of Norman, makes it unlawful for any officer of the City of Norman to directly or indirectly give, or promise to give, any person any office, position, employment, or anything of value for the purpose of influencing or obtaining support, political or otherwise, aid, or influence of any person. Engaging in any of these activities is grounds for removal from office. 
(3)  A de minimis personal gift, lunch, or entertainment under one hundred dollars ($100.00) is permissible if given without the intent to influence. The ethical principle is that officials obtain no personal gain from performance of their duties except official compensation and the satisfaction of a job well done. 
(g)  Use or disclosure of confidential information. Elected City Officials are prohibited from disclosing or offering to disclose confidential information to any party not entitled to receive such information nor shall he or she use such information for his or her personal gain or benefit. City of Norman Code Section 2-103 prevents Councilmembers from making use of special knowledge or information obtained from their position before that knowledge or information is made available to the public. 
(h)  Role of the City Attorney. 
(1)  Questions about the City of Norman Council Ethics contained herein, a conflict of interest, or other ethical problems related to the business of the City of Norman, should be presented to the Norman City Attorney's office. If time permits, requests should be in writing to the City Attorney directly.

(c)  The constitution of the Commission shall be apolitical and the individuals serving on it shall be from a variety of backgrounds and expertise. Thus, professionals from areas directly related to children's rights should be represented and concerned citizens who are not professionals in the field will also be represented. 
The nine (9) member Commission shall include representatives from: 
(1)  The Public School System (e.g., teacher, administrator or counselor); 
(2)  The medical community (e.g., nurse, P.A., M.D.); 
(3)  Juvenile Services/Child Welfare; 
(4)  Family Counseling (e.g., counselor, pastor, etc.); 
(5)  Legal System (e.g., lawyer or District Attorney's Office). 
These professionals, while serving on the board, would serve as advisors regarding issues relating to their various areas of expertise. 
The remaining seats (seats (6)-(9)) would be filled by community members concerned with the diverse and complex area of children's rights. Thus, the Commission would function with input from both professionals and lay people and therefore would provide a broader perspective on the pressing needs of children. 
Members on the Commission shall serve a three-year term and may be reappointed. The Commission shall elect its own chair. 
(d)  The Commission shall implement its objectives in the following ways: 
(1)  It shall conduct joint meetings with other agencies in order to promote communication between agencies; to further information regarding various services provided; and to promote an atmosphere of collaboration on programs and services of mutual interest; 
(2)  It shall conduct study sessions to evaluate the status of existing laws and statutes and report to the City Council and/or the Human Rights Commission as appropriate action may dictate; 
(3)  It shall work closely with all forms of media to provide accurate information regarding children's issues and services and to promote the coverage of such issues; and 
(4)  It shall prepare an annual report to be presented to the City Council concerning the state of children's needs in the City, programs and services offered over the past year and tentative plans for the future year.

    A Greenbelt System, as defined herein, serves the following principles, purposes and goals of the City of Norman. 
(a)  Proposed additions to the Greenbelt System should be guided by the following principles: 
(1)  The ultimate goal is to create an interconnected system of trails that allow multiple connections across all of Norman. 
(2)  The Greenbelt System should preserve valuable green space, natural habitat and key areas with existing vegetation. 
(3)  Trail segments should be designed so that they convey the physical and historical character of the City of Norman and relate to the neighborhoods through which the trail corridors pass. 
(4)  Greenway corridors should provide unique opportunities to learn about the history, culture, and accomplishments of Norman. 
(5)  Trails should promote smooth walkable corridors that are open and visible. 
(6)  The Greenbelt System should contribute to enhancing the physical appearance of the City, whether through new pedestrian features, landscaping added to trail corridors, or simply by revealing natural areas not previously visible to the general public. 
(7)  The Greenbelt System should encourage the creation of public and private partnerships that help build the entire system more quickly. 
(8)  Greenbelts should protect environmentally sensitive lands that are generally the least suitable for development, especially floodprone areas and riparian corridors, and provide connectivity between the elements of the Greenbelt System. 
(b)  The use of lot clustering should be encouraged as a means to develop the Greenbelt System. 
(c)  The Greenbelt System should be used to link together existing recreation areas. 
(d)  Multipurpose greenways should be created that: 
(1)  Create a unique greenway character for Norman; 
(2)  Protect the environmentally sensitive areas of the City and serve as a wildlife habitat; 
(3)  Serve as a stormwater management resource for urban runoff and regional detention needs; 
(4)  Provide recreation opportunities for bicycling, walking, and jogging, as well as an alternate route to move through the City for commuting to work, schools, shopping, between neighborhoods, and/or other destinations by bicycling or walking; 
(5)  Preserve agriculturally significant lands through conservation easements or other means; and 
(6)  Provide suitable locations for sanitary sewer easements and facilities. 
(e)  Greenbelts should be used to provide green space areas adjacent to highways and major streets for sound buffer zones and protection from incompatible land uses. 
(f)  The Greenbelt System should continue to improve a natural landscape planting and maintenance program for City-owned properties and rights-of-way of major streets and highways. 
(Ord. No. 0-1011-6, § 5) 
Sec. 4-2027. - Greenbelt Enhancement Statements. 
(a)  Submission. All applications for a Pre-Development meeting regarding a proposed Land Use Plan amendment, a Norman Rural Certificate of Survey or preliminary platting of land in the City shall include a Greenbelt Enhancement Statement. 
(b)  Content. Greenbelt Enhancement Statements shall articulate how the principles, purposes and goals of this article are met by the proposed development and its amenities. Applicants shall also provide supporting drawings, illustrations, and other documents designed to assist the Greenbelt Commission in determining how the goals, principles, and policies herein are met by the development. 
(c)  Review. 
(1)  Staff review: The Planning Director or designee shall perform an initial review of the Greenbelt Enhancement Statement. If the application indicates that an opportunity for greenbelt development does not exist and the details of the application support such a finding, then the Planning Director or designee may issue a finding of No Greenbelt Opportunity. Such a finding shall be based on factors unique to the subject parcel, such as when the application involves redevelopment of an already fully-developed site, rezoning of property that does not involve new construction, or the existing plat requirements are such that development options are restricted. If a Finding of No Greenbelt Opportunity is made, then the application shall be forwarded to the Greenbelt Commission for consideration as a consent docket item as outlined in subsection (2)a. below. If a request for a Finding of No Greenbelt Opportunity is denied, a completed Greenbelt Enhancement Statement shall be forwarded to the Greenbelt Commission for consideration as set forth below. 
(2)  Initial review by Greenbelt Commission: 
a.  Findings of No Greenbelt Opportunity. If such a finding is made by the Planning Director or designee, then the application shall be forwarded to the Greenbelt Commission for consideration as a consent docket item to allow the Commission to determine whether it agrees with Staff's finding of No Greenbelt Opportunity. If a Commission member disagrees with Staff's finding of No Greenbelt Opportunity, said member may request that the item be removed from the consent docket and the item will be reviewed in the same manner as other applications. If the Commission agrees with Staff's finding of No Greenbelt Opportunity, the subject application will bypass further review by the Commission and be forwarded on to the Planning Commission as provided for in the City Code. 
b.  Other applications. All other applications for which a Greenbelt Enhancement Statement is completed shall be considered by the Greenbelt Commission for an initial review when application is made for a Pre-Development meeting and upon due notice of its consideration to the applicant. Comments about applications shall be in writing and delivered to the applicant. Those comments shall also be provided to the Planning Commission and to the City Council upon each respective body's consideration of the application. The comments from the Greenbelt Commission will reflect how the proposed development does or does not meet the goals of the Greenbelt System through reference to specific principles, purposes and goals set forth herein. 
(3)  Subsequent review by Greenbelt Commission. Should it be determined that a greenbelt opportunity exists for a particular application and if the application has substantially changed (as determined by Planning and Community Development staff) since it was originally considered by the Greenbelt Commission, the Greenbelt Enhancement Statement shall be reviewed by the Greenbelt Commission at one of its regularly scheduled meetings after application is made to the Planning Commission and upon due notice of its consideration to the applicant. Comments about applications shall be in writing and delivered to the applicant with the Planning Commission packet. Those comments shall also be provided to the Planning Commission and to the City Council upon each respective body's consideration of the application. The comments from the Greenbelt Commission will reflect how the proposed development does or does not meet the goals of the Greenbelt system through reference to specific principles, purposes and goals set forth herein.

Charter reference- City parks, Art. VIII. 

Sec. 5-501. - Purpose and applicability. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide for the development of parkland for the use and enjoyment of all citizens within the City. It is deemed to be in the public interest to provide both neighborhood and community-wide recreational facilities for the use and enjoyment of all citizens, and these facilities contribute directly to the quality of life and value of living in the City. As the City continues to grow and expand, new residents create additional demands for park facilities, both at the neighborhood and the community level. Hence, it is appropriate that the new users of the facilities which create additional demand pay for such improvements. This article shall apply to all new residential construction occurring within the City, and such park development fee provisions contained in this article shall be paid or accounted for at the time any building permit is issued for new residential construction within the City. 
(Ord. No. 0-9394-47) 
Sec. 5-502. - Definitions. 
    [The following terms, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Capital project means an improvement that is purchased, constructed, or installed, having a value of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) and a useful life of more than one (1) year, exclusive of any design/engineering fees or soft costs associated therewith. 
    Community parks means areas suited for community-wide recreational facilities, such as athletic complexes, large swimming pools, or areas of natural quality for outdoor recreation, such as walking, viewing, sitting, or picnicking. May be any combination of the above, depending upon site suitability and community need. For the purpose of this article, community parks shall include Griffin Community Park, Reaves park, Andrews Park, Sutton Urban Wilderness Area, John Saxon Park and Ruby Grant Park. 
    Letter of credit means an engagement by a federally insured financial institution providing that the institution will honor drafts or other demands for payment by the holder of such letter upon compliance with conditions specified in the letter of credit. For the purpose of this article, the letter of credit must be irrevocable and issued by a federally insured financial institution. 
    Neighborhood parks means an area for neighborhood recreational activities, such as field games, court games, crafts, playground apparatus area, picnicking, walking or jogging trails, or other related activities. For the purpose of this article, neighborhood parks shall be all public park sites not listed as community parks in this article. 
    Norman Board of Park Commissioners shall be as provided in article VIII, section 1 of the City Charter. 
    Park site means land, whether developed or undeveloped, private or public, intended for active or passive recreational use, so designated for the purposes of fulfillment of this article. 
    Private recreational development means one (1) or more capital projects to be owned and maintained by a mandatory property owners association designed for the recreational use and enjoyment by the members of such association. 
    Property owners association means a formal association requiring mandatory membership of the owners of the property located within a defined area and formed for, among other things, the construction, improvement, and maintenance of property owned in common by the association. 
    Residential dwelling unit means any room or group of rooms located within a dwelling and forming a single, habitable unit with facilities which are used, or intended to be used, for living, sleeping, cooking, and eating. 
    Revolving fund, for the purpose of this article, means and shall consist of an account established as a depository for the payment of public park development fees collected at the time of issuance of a building permit, which shall be expended for capital projects within public parks and shall be replenished on an ongoing basis from funds collected with the issuance of building permits as provided herein. 
(Ord. No. 0-9394-47; Ord. No. 0-0607-21, § 1) 
Sec. 5-503. - Development fee. 
(a)  All persons, firms, or corporations developing new residential dwelling units within the boundaries of the City shall, at the time of issuance of a building permit and subject to the other provisions hereinafter following: 
(1)  Pay a development fee to be used for improving facilities within community public parks; and 
(2)  Pay a development fee for neighborhood park purposes or have received credit for neighborhood facilities within the area for which such unit was part of a property owners association owning and controlling such park improvements. The neighborhood development fee is waived for permits on land zoned A-2, A-1, or RE that is not located within one (1) mile of an existing neighborhood park. 
(b)  For each residential dwelling unit, the development fee shall be seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for neighborhood park development and seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for community park development, such funds to be deposited in a separate account to be allocated for capital projects in such park as hereinafter provided. No fee is assessed for remodeling, altering, or replacing an existing dwelling unit, unless such construction results in a net increase in the number of residential units on a lot. 
(Ord. No. 0-9394-47) 
Sec. 5-504. - Use of funds. 
(a)  All fees collected at the time of issuance of a building permit for new residential dwelling units shall be placed in the appropriate community or specific neighborhood capital project development account.

(b)  With respect to development of neighborhood recreational capital projects, the Norman Board of Park Commissioners may make a determination and the City Council may provide advanced funding for development of neighborhood recreational facilities at such time as the Commissioners determine that sufficient residential units have been constructed within the area served by such neighborhood park to warrant construction of one (1) or more new recreational capital projects. In such cases, with the recommendation of the Board, the City Council may utilize a combination of the fees collected to date from the pertinent neighborhood account, along with appropriated funds from the neighborhood revolving fund account. In any case, the capital recreational project, or projects to be constructed, shall be located in a parkland area that directly serves the residential units from which such park fees are generated, and in no case shall such neighborhood fees be expended in a park area that is more than one (1) mile from the residential units which generated the fees. 
(Ord. No. 0-9394-47) 
Sec. 5-505. - Credit for private recreational facilities. 
(a)  Instead of paying for that portion of the park development fee attributed to neighborhood parks, credit may be gained for recreational facilities installed on land owned by a mandatory property owners association which has been zoned PL by the City Council. In order to gain such credit: 
(1)  Qualifying recreational facilities must have been built that meet or exceed the dollar amount of the fee that would have been collected from each dwelling unit in the subdivision. Excess credit may be carried forward to future developments, provided those areas are included in the same property owners association and share ownership of, and responsibility for, the improvements. 
(2)  When qualifying improvements are built at a later date or within a future phase of development, credit will be given if a cash surety is posted that is equal to the dollar amount that would have been generated by the total of the number of dwelling units built in that phase. Such surety, in the form of a certificate of deposit or letter of credit, shall be made payable to the City of Norman and will be released upon the satisfactory completion of the eligible recreational improvements and costs adequately documented to the Board of Park Commissioners. Any and all interest earned on such certificate of deposit shall belong to, and be paid to, the person, firm or corporation contributing to the funds. 
(b)  Credit shall be given by the City for the following recreational facilities built on land owned and maintained by a private property owners association: 
(1)  Playground equipment such as swings, slides, and climbing equipment. 
(2)  Picnic shelters and gazebos, benches, tables, and grills. 
(3)  Sports facilities such as basketball courts, volleyball courts, baseball/softball fields and backstops, soccer fields and goals, disc golf courses, or tennis courts, including appurtenant lighting for such facilities. 
(4)  Walking paths or jogging trails, including any necessary pedestrian bridges, other than those sidewalk installations normally associated with residential development. 
(5)  Boat docks and fishing piers. 
(6)  Other improvements may be approved by the Board of Park Commissioners if they meet neighborhood recreational needs similar to facilities normally provided in public neighborhood parks. 
(c)  The following improvements may not be counted for credit: 
(1)  Swimming or wading pools, hot tubs, cabanas, or clubhouses, including appurtenant showers, restrooms, or decking. 
(2)  Lakes, ponds, including detention/retention ponds, streams, natural or artificial drainageways, and fountains. 
(3)  Landscaping, including sprinkler systems. 
(4)  Decorative fencing, including that typically required as a subdivision improvement. 
(5)  Parking lots. 
(6)  Decorative or security lighting. 
(d)  Credit may be gained for qualifying recreational facilities, which have been built, owned and maintained by a mandatory property owners association six (6) months prior to the effective date of this article [November 1, 1994]. 
(Ord. No. 0-9394-47) 
Sec. 5-506. - Process. 
(a)  When an applicant chooses to develop private recreational facilities on land that will be owned by a mandatory property owners association, the location, type, and estimated cost of the improvements should be submitted to the Board of Park Commissioners as part of their review of all preliminary plats. Private lands designated on a preliminary and final plat must be zoned PL, Park Land, in order to secure credit for any recreational improvements that are or will be installed. 
(b)  When any final plat is submitted that indicates land that is to be owned in common by a mandatory property owners association, covenants must be submitted and reviewed that demonstrate that membership in the property owners association is mandatory, that annual dues to provide maintenance are compulsory, and that no disposition of common park or open space property is possible without the approval of the City Council. 
(c)  If recreational improvements are deferred to a future date or future phase, the cash surety that has been pledged will be released only after qualified improvements have been installed, and the cost of the improvements documented. If the improvements are not made according to the proposed schedule, the City may call the surety and hold the money in an escrow account until the property owners association is able to accomplish an alternative improvement. If that recreational facility qualifies for credit, then the escrowed money will be released if the documented cost of the improvement exceeds the amount of the escrow.

(c)  To insure prompt, proper and adequate extension of the plant and service and maintenance thereof at the highest practicable standard of efficiency, the City hereby requires extension of subscriber service to all residents of the City in accordance with the following policy: 
Grantee, at its own cost, will extend its lines into new areas of development that have ten (10) homes for every one-fourth (1/4) mile of cable plant required to serve those ten (10) homes. In franchised areas with less than ten (10) homes per one-quarter (1/4) mile of cable plant necessary to serve those residents desiring service shall be provided on a prorated cost sharing basis.

All line extensions provided in accordance with this policy shall at all times remain the property of the Grantee. Each Subscriber's prorated shares of construction costs shall be individually negotiated with the Grantee according to the above guidelines and shall be payable prior to commencement of construction.

Sec. 10-402. - Regulations. 
(a)  General discharge prohibitions. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will cause pass through or interference of the operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW, whether or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(b)  Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater: 
(1)  Pollutants which, by reason of their nature or quantity, are, or may be, sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other substances, to create a fire or explosion hazard or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty (140) degrees Fahrenheit or sixty (60) degrees centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.

(c)  National categorical pretreatment standards. The national categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, parts 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated. 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Control Authority may impose equivalent mass limits in accordance with subsection 10-402(c)(3). 
(2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Control Authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(3)  When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the City convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Control Authority. The City may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections 10-402(c)(3)a.1. through 10-402(c)(3)a.5. below. 
a.  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
1.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its wastewater discharge permit; 
2.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
3.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
4.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
5.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
b.  An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
1.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
2.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
3.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the Control Authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection 10-402(c)(3)a.3n. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Control Authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
4.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 10-402(c)(3)a.1. so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
c.  When developing equivalent mass limits, the Control Authority: 
1.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
2.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
3.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection 10-402(h). The industrial user must also be in compliance with subsection 10-402(o) regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
4.  Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this Section 10-402(c) in lieu of the promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
5.  Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
6.  Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the Control Authority within two (2) business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Control Authority of such anticipated change will be required to meet the concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. 
(d)  Local limits. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following daily maximum limits. 
Pollutant ..... mg/l 
Arsenic ..... 0.78 
Cadmium ..... 0.19

(2)  Where a local limit is expressed only in terms of the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Control Authority may impose equivalent mass limits in accordance with subsection 10-402(d)(3). 
(3)  When a local limit is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the City convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Control Authority. The City may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections 10-402(d)(3)a.1. through 10-402(d)(3)a.5. below. 
a.  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
1.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its wastewater discharge permit; 
2.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable Local Limits, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
3.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
4.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
5.  Have consistently complied with all applicable Local Limit during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
b.  An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
1.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
2.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
3.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the Control Authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty (20) percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection 10-402(d)(3)a.3. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Control Authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
4.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 10-402(d)(3)a.1. so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
c.  When developing equivalent mass limits, the Control Authority: 
1.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the facility of the industrial user by the concentration-based local limit for the applicable local limit and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
2.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
3.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection 10-402(h). The industrial user must also be in compliance with subsection 10-402(o) regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
4.  Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this subsection 10-402(d) in lieu of the local limit from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(e)  BOD, TSS, and TKN are surchargeable parameters. Surcharge is based on anything above two hundred (200) mg/l for BOD, one hundred fifty (150) mg/l TSS, and/or thirty (30) mg/l TKN. 
(f)  State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article. 
(g)  City's right of revision. The City reserves the right to establish by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 10-401(a) of this article. 
(h)  Excessive discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City or state. ( Comment: The City reserves the right to prescribe by user permit alternative mass-based standards in lieu of concentration-based standards where evidence indicates dilution has occurred). 
(i)  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. The City shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The City may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the City may develop such a plan for any user. When the City determines that it is necessary for a significant industrial user to have a slug control plan, the slug control plan shall become a part of the significant industrial user's permit. Significant industrial users must notify the City immediately of any changes at their facility, not already addressed in their slug control plan or other slug control requirements, which may affect the potential for a slug discharge. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within five (5) days; 
(4)  If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment necessary for emergency response. 
(j)  Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the control authority a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(k)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(l)  Hauled wastewater. 
(1)  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the Control Authority, and at such times as are established by the Control Authority. Such waste shall not violate any requirements of this article. The Control Authority may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
(2)  The Control Authority shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The Control Authority may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The Control Authority also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste.

(1)  Definition. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3) are met. 
(3)  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c.  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and Control Authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Opportunity. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Control. Industrial users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(o)  Bypass. 
(1)  Definitions. 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. "Severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  Notice. 
a.  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Control Authority, if possible, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass. 
b.  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Control Authority within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Control Authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  Prohibition of bypass. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the Control Authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this section. 
b.  The Control Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Control Authority determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (4)a. of this section. 
(p)  Best management practices. 
(1)  Application of best management practices. Upon petition to, and approval by the Control Authority, users may, in lieu of monitoring for the local limits set forth in section 10-402, develop and implement a best management practice (BMP) policy. When facilities defined to be significant industrial users are allowed to use BMPs to control pollutants, those BMPs will become a part of their wastewater discharge permit and subject to the same conditions. Once approved by the Control Authority, a facility's BMP becomes a fully enforceable pretreatment standard. After approval of a BMP policy for a non-significant user, the Control Authority shall issue the non-significant industrial user a Certificate of BMP Approval. BMPs are subject to revision as deemed necessary by the Control Authority and facilities will be given thirty (30) days notice. Facilities failing to abide by an approved BMP, will be subject to: 
a.  The local limits set forth in section 10-402. 
b.  Enforcement actions set out in section 10-405. 
c.  Obtaining a permit as set forth in section 10-404. 
(2)  BMP policy components. The minimum components of an approved BMP include the following: 
a.  A description of the facility's industrial processes; 
b.  A detailed description of the facility's wastewater treatment operations; 
c.  A list and description of the chemicals used or stored at the facility; 
d.  Policies and procedures for employee training; 
e.  A detailed description of the industry's pollution prevention policies; 
f.  A detailed description of the methods used for minimizing, to the greatest practical extent, adverse environmental impact; 
g.  Other information as required by the Control Authority. 
(3)  Certificate of BMP approval. Upon approval of a BMP, the Control Authority will issue the non-significant user a certificate of BMP approval. Until the issuance of a certificate of BMP approval, non-significant users are subject to the local limits set out in section 10-402. A certificate of BMP approval shall be issued for a specified period of time, not to exceed five (5) years from the effective date of the certificate. A certificate of BMP approval may be issued for a period less than five (5) years, at the discretion of the Control Authority. Approval of BMPs for significant industrial users shall be through the issuance/modification of a wastewater discharge permit. 
(4)  Transfer of BMP approval. A certificate of BMP approval for a non-significant user may be transferred to a new owner or operator only after at least thirty (30) days advance notice is given to the Control Authority. The notice from the non-significant user to the Control Authority must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
a.  States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations; 
b.  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; 
c.  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing BMP policy. 
Transfer of BMPs by significant industrial users shall adhere to the conditions of subsection 10-404(b)(6). 
(5)  Revocation of BMP approval. The Control Authority may revoke a certificate of BMP approval for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
a.  Failure to notify the Control Authority of significant changes to the facility or the type of wastewater discharged from the facility; 
b.  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the request for certificate of BMP approval; 
c.  Failure to update and revise a facility's BMP policy as needed, and submit such changes to the Control Authority within thirty (30) days of such change(s); 
d.  Refusing to allow the Control Authority timely access to the facility premises and records; 
e.  Failure to comply with an enforcement action; 
f.  Failure to complete a wastewater survey; 
g.  Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership; 
h.  Failure to comply with the provisions and intent of an approved BMP policy.

(c)  Reporting requirements for industrial users. 
(1)  Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standard, baseline report. Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision is made upon a category determination submission under Section 403.6(a)(4) of 40 CFR, whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the Control Authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (1)a. through g. of this section. At least ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of discharge, new sources and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall be required to submit to the Control Authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (1)a. through e. of this section. New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment that the source intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in paragraphs (1)d. and e. of this section: 
a.  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owners; 
b.  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
c.  Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production and the standard industrial classification (SIC) of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates the points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow in gallons per day to the POTW from each of the following: 
1.  Regulated process streams; and 
2.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of Section 403.6(e) of 40 CFR. 
 The Control Authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process; 
2.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass where required by the Control Authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations; 
3.  A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, twenty-four-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The Control Authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is unfeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged; 
4.  The user shall take a minimum of one (1) representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph; 
5.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow the use of the combined wastestream formula of Section 403.6(e) of 40 CFR in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.6(e) this adjusted limit, along with supporting data, shall be submitted to the Control Authority; 
6.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136, does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties approved by the Administrator; 
7.  The Control Authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; 
8.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and the methods of analysis and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW; 
f.  Certification. A statement reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in section 10-401(b)) and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis; and, if not, whether additional operational and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements; and 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
1.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR Part 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR Part 403.6(e)) and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR Part 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by paragraph (1) of this section, the information required by paragraphs (1)f. and g. of this section shall pertain to the modified limits. 
2.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (403.7), the combined wastestream formula (403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (403.13) after the user submits the report required by paragraph (1) of this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by paragraphs (1)f. and g. of this section shall be submitted by the user to the Control Authority within sixty (60) days after the modified limit is approved. 
(2)  Compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule requirement by paragraph (1)g. of this section: 
a.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). 
b.  No increment referred to in paragraph (2)a. of this section shall exceed nine (9) months. 
c.  Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the Control Authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the Control Authority. 
(3)  Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following the commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Control Authority a report containing the information described in paragraphs (1)d.-f. of this section. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Control Authority in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR Part 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
(4)  Periodic continued compliance reports. 
a.  Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Control Authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Control Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the discharge reported in paragraph (1)d. of the section except that the Control Authority may require more detailed reporting of flows. At the discretion of the Control Authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Control Authority may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
b.  The Control Authority may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subparagraph (4)a. shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by [subparagraph] (4)a. shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. 
(5)  Notice of potential problems, including slug loading. 
a.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Control Authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
b.  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the Control Authority, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this section. 
c.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
d.  Significant industrial users are required to notify the Control Authority immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(6)  Monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance. 
a.  The reports required in paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of this section shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the Control Authority, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the Control Authority in lieu of the industrial user. Where the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the user will not be required to submit the compliance certification required under 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)(6) and 403.12(d). In addition, where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
b.  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the Control Authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation,. Where the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, either the POTW will repeat the sampling within thirty days (30) or the user will be required to repeat the sampling within thirty (30) days. The repeat sampling requirement does not apply if: 
1.  The Control Authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
2.  The Control Authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
c.  The reports required in paragraph (4) of this section shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The Control Authority shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
d.  All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator. Where 40 CFR does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the Administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Control Authority or other parties, approved by the Administrator. 
e.  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in paragraph (4) of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Control Authority, using the procedures prescribed in paragraph (6)d. of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
f.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, twenty-four-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The Control Authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is unfeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged; 
2.  The user shall take a minimum of one (1) representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph; 
3.  The report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and the methods of analysis and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW; 
(7)  Reporting requirements for industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. The Control Authority shall require appropriate reporting from those industrial users with discharges that are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the Control Authority at least once every six (6) months (on dates specified by the Control Authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the Control Authority. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question or where the Administrator determines that the 40 CFR Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other persons, approved by the Administrator. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the Control Authority in lieu of the significant noncategorical industrial user. Where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, the noncategorical significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
(8)  Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall promptly notify the Control Authority in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted under paragraph (11) of this section. 
(9)  Signatory requirements for industrial user reports. The reports required by paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of this section shall include the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR Part 403.6(a)(2)(ii), and shall be signed by an authorized representative as defined in 10-401(b). 
If an authorization of an authorized representative as defined in 10-401(b) is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements as defined in 10-401(b) must be submitted to the Control Authority prior to, or together with, any reports to be signed by an authorized representative. 
(10)  Record-keeping requirements. 
a.  Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section. Such reports shall include for all samples: 
1.  The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking the samples; 
2.  The dates analyses were performed; 
3.  Who performed the analyses; 
4.  The analytical techniques/methods used; and 
5.  The results of such analysis. 
b.  Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall be required to retain for a minimum of three (3) years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this section) and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the Director, the Regional Administrator and the Control Authority. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or when requested by the Director, the Regional Administrator, or the Control Authority. 
(11)  Hazardous waste notification. 
a.  The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notification must take place within one hundred eighty (180) days of the effective date of this rule. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall provide the notification no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under paragraph (8) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under self-monitoring requirements. 
b.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (11)a. of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
c.  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
d.  In the case of any notification made under paragraph (11) of this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(d)  Monitoring facilities. The Control Authority shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the Control Authority may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
    There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
    Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the Control Authority's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the Control Authority. 
(e)  Inspection and sampling. The Control Authority shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Control Authority, Approval Authority, and/or EPA, or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, records copying or in the performance of any of its duties. The Control Authority, Approval Authority and the EPA, where the NPDES state is the Approval Authority, shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City, Approval Authority and the EPA will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(f)  Pretreatment. 
(1)  Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Control Authority shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Control Authority for review and shall be acceptable to the Control Authority before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Control Authority under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Control Authority prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(2)  Non-significant users which use silver in their process and, as a result thereof, have a wastewater discharge from that process containing waste silver must participate in the Silver Best Management Practices (BMP) Program and meet the requirements described generally in subsection 10-402(p) or be permitted as a significant industrial user. Upon approval of the BMP, the Control Authority will issue the facility a certificate of BMP approval. Until the issuance of a certificate of BMP approval, facilities are subject to the local limits set out in subsection 10-402(d). 
(3)  Non-significant users which generate fats, oils, and grease (FOG) in their process and, as a result thereof, have a wastewater discharge from that process containing waste FOG must participate in the FOG Best Management Practices (BMP) Program and meet the requirements described generally in subsection 10-402(p) or be permitted as a significant industrial user. Upon approval of the BMP, the Control Authority will issue the facility a certificate of BMP approval. Until the issuance of a certificate of BMP approval, facilities are subject to the local limits set out in subsection 10-402(d). 
(4)  Enzymes, microbes, etc. are prohibited, for oil and grease, BOD, and/or TSS removal unless special permission is granted by the Utilities Director and proof is given that they cause no harm to the system. 
(5)  All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or Approval Authority upon request. 
(g)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests confidentiality and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Control Authority that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
    When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the NPDES program, the OPDES program, and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
    Information accepted by the Control Authority as confidential shall not be transmitted to the general public by the Control Authority until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user. 
(Ord. No. 0-8889-31; Ord. No. 0-9293-28; Ord. No. 0-9495-52; Ord. No. 0-0001-16; Ord. No. 0-0203-22; Ord. No. 0-0506-115, § 2; Ord. No. O-0809-27) 
Sec. 10-405. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Harmful discharges. The Control Authority may suspend the water service or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Control Authority, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the City to violate any condition of its OPDES permit. 
    Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Control Authority shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including the immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. 
(b)  Termination of discharge. Any user who violates the following conditions of this article or applicable state and federal regulations is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
(2)  Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(3)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; 
(4)  Violation of conditions of the permit; or 
(5)  Violations of the pretreatment standards. 
(c)  Notice of violation. Whenever the Control Authority finds that any user has violated or is violating this article, wastewater discharge permit or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained herein, the Control Authority may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the Control Authority by the user. 
(d)  Show cause hearing. 
(1)  The Control Authority may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the City Council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the City Council regarding the violation, the reasons the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action and directing the user to show cause before the City Council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
(2)  The City Council may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the assigned department to: 
a.  Issue in the name of the City Council notices of hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; 
b.  Take the evidence; 
c.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence together with recommendations, to the City Council for action thereon. 
(3)  At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript so recorded will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon the payment of the usual charges therefor. 
(4)  After the City Council has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the water service or sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed on existing treatment facilities, and such devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
(e)  Compliance orders. When the Control Authority finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Control Authority may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within ninety (90) days. If the user does not come into compliance within ninety (90) days, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Cease and desist orders. When the Control Authority finds that a user is violating this article, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Control Authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements. 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The Control Authority may immediately suspend a user's discharge whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to be present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Control Authority may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its discharge. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Control Authority shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer and/or water connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Control Authority shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Control Authority, prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Legal action. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the City's POTW, contrary to the provisions of this article, federal or state pretreatment requirements or any order of the City, the City Attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Circuit Court of this county. 
(Ord. No. 0-8889-31; Ord. No. 0-9293-28; Ord. No. 0-0001-16; Ord. No. O-0809-27) 
Sec. 10-406. - Penalty; costs. 
(a)  Civil penalties. The City may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities. Including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City. In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(b)  Criminal penalties. Any person convicted of violating the provisions of this article or of failing to comply with the rules and regulations enacted pursuant to this article shall be punished by a monetary fine in an amount of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day that a violation or failure to comply exists shall constitute a separate and distinct offense, and any one (1) or more of such offenses may be set out in any complaint or information filed. 
(c)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article or the wastewater discharge permit or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in this section. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies in sections 10-401 through 10-406 are not exclusive remedies. The City reserves the right to take any, all or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will be in accordance with the City's enforcement response plan. However, the City reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the City is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently. 
(e)  Significant noncompliance. The Control Authority shall annually publish in the City of Norman's largest daily newspaper a list of the users which were in significant noncompliance (as defined in 40 CFR Part 403.8 (f)(2)(viii)) with pretreatment requirements or standards during the twelve (12) previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the users during the same twelve (12) months.

Cross reference- Air quality control, § 10-101 et seq. 

Sec. 10-501. - Purpose. 
    Smoking in certain areas has been determined to be injurious to human health, to constitute a source of annoyance and discomfort to nonsmokers, and to be a public nuisance due to the following: 
(1)  Reliable studies have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard for certain population groups, including elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease; and 
(2)  Health hazards induced by breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise tolerance, decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction, and bronchospasm; and 
(3)  Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who suffer other ill effects of breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of adverse reactions to same; and 
(4)  The smoking of tobacco, or any other weed or plant, is a danger to health. 
    Therefore, no person shall smoke or carry any lighted smoking instrument in a public place, public park, or at a public meeting except in permitted smoking areas.

In order for such parking areas to maintain their legal non-conforming status, the following procedures shall be followed: 
1.  Gravel surfaces must be kept substantially free of any grass or weeds.

ARTICLE IX. - UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 10-901. - Purpose. 
    As technology advances, the number of service providers utilizing the public rights-of-way increases. Utility companies provide critical infrastructure for the City and its residents, including electrical, gas, water and sewer infrastructure. The ability of the infrastructure to provide reliable, abundant, accessible and affordable services is important to the City's economy and security. To enable easy access to the infrastructure in the public rights-of-way, the rights-of-way must be maintained. This includes vegetation management. Effective vegetation management can prevent electricity outages, erosion, and water quality issues. Vegetation management can negatively impact adjacent property owners if chemicals are overused, trees are trimmed inappropriately, and communication with impacted property owners is insufficient. The purpose of this article is to provide a framework for the use of appropriate, environmentally sound, and cost-effective vegetation control methods, while also providing for better communication between providers and property owners and community education. 
(Ord. No. 0-1819-33, § 2) 
Sec. 10-902. - Planned maintenance. 
(a)  The City recognizes that each utility company plans their work based on operating within a specific regulatory framework, system conditions, and budget availability. The implementation and execution of a maintenance plan can be affected by factors beyond the utility's control, such as unexpected changes in conditions or severe weather events. Each utility company shall work with the City to identify in advance any planned maintenance that is scheduled to occur within the city limits. Information provided by the utility company shall include: 
(1)  General areas (e.g., substation or circuit for electric utilities) involved scheduled for maintenance; 
(2)  Identification of a certified arborist to serve as a contact person for any questions about vegetation management activities. 
(3)  Identification of any company the utility company intends to use for planned vegetation maintenance work. 
(b)  If a utility's vegetation management plan changes for any of the areas identified within the City, the utility will communicate those changes to the appropriate City representative in a timely manner. The City may communicate planned maintenance information provided by a utility to the community in a format the City determines to be appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 0-1819-33, § 3) 
Sec. 10-903. - Stakeholder communication. 
(a)  Notification to owners or residents of occupied property. Prior to the performance of planned vegetation maintenance by a utility on occupied property, the utility shall make reasonable efforts to provide prior notification of such activities to the owner or resident of such property. Such prior notification may include, but is not limited to, any of the following methods: door hangers, mailed letters, posted signs on the occupied property. 
(b)  Meetings with owners or residents of occupied property. If an owner or resident of an occupied property requests a meeting with a utility regarding vegetation maintenance that is to occur on said property, then the utility shall make reasonable efforts to meet with the owner or resident of said property to explain the objectives and methods used to achieve them, and to identify expected impacts to any trees. 
(c)  Notifications and communications for emergency vegetation maintenance or management. In the case of emergency reactive work, the notification provisions of this section shall be waived. The utility company shall give as much notice as is reasonable and possible under the circumstances to the owners or residents of occupied property. 
(d)  Dangerous trees. In the case of a tree, large shrub or part thereof, living or dead, which is in such condition and is located in such a place as to constitute a danger to persons or property in the vicinity of the tree, the utility company shall not be required to notify the City in advance of any maintenance of the tree. Reasonable notification to the owner or resident of occupied property on which the tree is located is still required. 
(Ord. No. 0-1819-33, § 4) 
Sec. 10-904. - Best management practices. 
    All tree work conducted by utility companies shall be governed by the applicable ANSI A300 standards and accompanying best management practices, and subsequent revisions. 
(a)  Pruning. The following subsections are general guidelines only, and it is important to recognize that site conditions, system hardware, tree species, tree size, approximate tree age, and maintenance history are all factors that influence the best approach to maintaining a tree that could impact a utility system: 
(1)  Proper pruning cuts are critical to a tree's ability to compartmentalize disease; 
(2)  Smaller pruning cuts compartmentalize better, heal faster, and place less stress on the tree; 
(3)  Pruning large branches requires a three-cut method to prevent bark from tearing; 
(4)  Topping and roundover methods are generally prohibited unless deemed appropriate for a specific tree by a certified arborist or in consultation with the property owner; 
(5)  Acceptable pruning systems include: natural, pollarding, and topiary; 
(6)  Structural, directional, and emergency pruning objectives can be met using: 
a.  Branch removal cuts 
b.  Heading cuts 
c.  Reduction cuts 
(7)  When appropriate to achieve the desired pruning objectives, pruning cuts should be made to lateral or parent branches that are no less than one-third ( 1/3 ) the diameter of the limb being removed; 
(8)  In rural areas and where access is limited by site conditions, mechanical pruning equipment may be used to achieve necessary clearance distances; 
(9)  Any obvious 'hangers' shall be removed while performing tree maintenance. 
(b)  Chemical control methods. The use of herbicides shall be governed by the product label and the approved application standards, as well as the regulations outlined in Title 2 of the Oklahoma Statutes and under applicable Federal law. The applicator shall consider conditions, such as temperature, winds, sensitive vegetation in the immediate area and intertwining root systems when making any herbicide application and do their utmost to avoid off target damage. 
(c)  Supervision and oversight of contractors. Any utility company desiring to engage in vegetation maintenance operations on public streets or rights-of-way, City-owned or controlled property, and private property within the City limits shall be responsible for oversight of its contractors in the performance of all work and will ensure that contractors adhere to ordinance provisions and proper vegetation maintenance practices. 
(d)  Identification. Any employee of a utility, or a contractor working on behalf of a utility, shall be required display identification on his or her person during any planned maintenance activity. Identification shall include the name of the employee, the contractor they are working for (if applicable) and the utility on whose behalf he or she is working. 
(e)  Vegetation management clean-up. 
(1)  All waste (chemicals, chemical containers, etc.) generated in clearance work shall be disposed of in compliance with applicable laws. 
(2)  All pruning debris from vegetation maintenance shall be cleaned up each day, unless permission is given by the owner or resident of the impacted property to do otherwise. This includes the following: 
a.  Impacted lawn areas shall be cleaned of debris; 
b.  Impacted streets and sidewalks shall be cleaned of debris; 
c.  All brush (having a diameter of six (6) inches or less), branches and logs shall be chipped and removed from the site. When feasible and agreed to by the owner or resident of the property and the utility company, the brush may be blown into an area within the rights-of-way or adjacent to the right-of-way corridor. Larger wood shall be cut into manageable lengths and stacked neatly at the base of the tree, unless otherwise specified by the owner or resident. 
(3)  If an owner or resident of impacted property requests information on options for grinding any stumps resulting from vegetation maintenance operations, it shall be the responsibility of the utility to provide owner or resident with such information. 
(4)  Chemicals are an important tool used in vegetation management. A property owner may request the utility remove dead, woody vegetation treated on their property within one hundred twenty (120) days following the utility's use of chemical control methods. That request shall be made directly to the utility through their customer service department. The utility shall respond within a reasonable time and remove the vegetation. This shall not include the removal of dead vines.

(d)  Membership in any labor organization shall be determined by each individual employee; provided, however, that in bargaining units where employees have selected a labor organization as exclusive representative, an agreement may be negotiated which provides that non-members of the labor organization shall pay to it a service charge for the negotiation and administration of a collective bargaining agreement in an amount not to exceed the regular periodic membership dues of the labor organization.

Sec. 12-202. - Exclusive recognition. 
(a)  A labor organization seeking exclusive recognition shall submit to the employer a roster of its officers and representatives, a copy of its Charter and Constitution and By-Laws, and a statement of its objectives and affirmation of its compliance with section 12-208 of this Code. 
(b)  The City Council shall accord exclusive recognition to a labor organization when the organization has been selected, in a secret ballot election, by a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit as their representative. When a labor organization has been accorded exclusive recognition, it is the exclusive representative of employees in the unit and is entitled to act for and to negotiate agreements covering all employees in the unit. It is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership. 
(c)  Bargaining units shall ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees concerned, promote effective dealings between the labor organization and the employer, and promote the efficiency of City operations. Therefore, there shall be established only three (3) bargaining units as a result of secret ballot elections. One bargaining knit shall include all uniformed fire personnel; a second bargaining unit shall include all commissioned police officers; the third bargaining unit shall include all employees not otherwise excluded. No bargaining unit shall be established it if includes: 
(1)  Any management official or supervisor or confidential employee; 
(2)  An employee engaged in administering this chapter; or 
(3)  A temporary or seasonal employee hired for a time certain of less than six (6) months during a fiscal year. 
(d)  All elections shall be conducted by secret ballot. Each employee in the bargaining unit shall be eligible to vote and shall be provided the opportunity to choose the labor organization he or she wishes to represent him or her from among those on the ballot, or "no union." When no category on the ballot receives a majority of the valid ballots cast, a runoff election shall be held between the two (2) categories receiving the largest and second largest number of votes in the first election. Elections may be held to determine whether: 
(1)  A labor organization should be recognized as the exclusive representative of employees in the unit; 
(2)  A labor organization should replace another labor organization as the exclusive representative; or 
(3)  A labor organization should cease to be the exclusive representative. 
(e)  The employer shall call and hold an election upon receipt of a timely, written petition signed by no less than thirty (30) percent of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit indicating their desire to be represented by a particular labor organization or to change or to withdraw recognition. No labor organization will be permitted to intervene in the election proceeding and secure a place on the ballot unless it has submitted a timely, written petition signed by no less than twenty (20) percent of the employees in the unit indicating their desire to be represented by that particular labor organization. The employer may hold an election when he has evidence supporting a good faith belief that the labor organization no longer is the choice of employees in the bargaining unit. 
(f)  When the employer has received an appropriate petition, the employer shall post notices to all employees containing information as to the name of the petitioner and a description of the bargaining unit involved. All interested labor organizations wishing to participate in the election must seek intervention within the ten (10) day period following the date of the posting of the notice by submitting a timely, written petition with the employer and otherwise meeting the requirements of this chapter. As soon as possible after the close of the period of intervention, the employer shall meet with representatives of the successful petitioner to arrange the details of the election. Following the meeting, the employer shall post appropriate notices of election. Such notices shall set forth details and procedures for the election, the appropriate unit, the eligibility period, the date, hour, and place of the election and shall contain a sample ballot which is clearly marked "sample" on its face. The employer shall provide the voting booths and ballot boxes. Each labor organization on the ballot and the employer may be represented by no more than two (2) observers of its own selection at the polling place. The observers' function is to see that the election is conducted fairly, the security of the ballot is maintained, and all eligible voters are given an opportunity to cast a ballot. At the conclusion of the balloting the ballots will be counted by the observers and an appropriate tally of ballots will be issued. Representatives of the labor organization and the employer shall sign the tally of ballots indicating that the tally is correct. The signing of the tally does not constitute a waiver of any rights by any party to file objections. If any party wishes to file objections or the number of challenged ballots are sufficient in number to affect the results of the election, such issue shall be submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 12-201 of this Code within five (5) days of the conclusion of the balloting. The City Manager shall promptly report the final results of the election to the City Council. 
(g)  There shall be no election to determine whether a labor organization should become, or continue to be recognized as, exclusive representative of the employees in any unit within twelve (12) months after a prior valid election with respect to such unit. When an agreement covering a bargaining unit has been signed by the employer and the incumbent exclusive representative, an election petition will not be timely unless filed with the employer not earlier than October 1 and not later than October 15. 
(h)  Recognition of a labor organization does not: 
(1)  Preclude an employee, regardless of whether he is in a unit of exclusive recognition, from exercising rights established by law, or from choosing his own representative in the exercise of such rights; or 
(2)  Preclude the employer from consulting or dealing with lawful associations, not qualified as a labor organization, with respect to matters or policies which involve individual members of the association or are of particular applicability to it or its members. These consultations and dealings shall be so limited that they do not assume the character of consultation or dealings on matters of general employee-management policy covering employees in the bargaining unit or extend to areas where recognition of the interests of one employee group may result in discrimination against or injury to the interests of other employees. 
(i)  When a labor organization has been found to have committed a section 12-207(b)(4) unfair labor practice, the City Manager shall report promptly this finding to the City Council, and the City Manager may recommend that the labor organization's exclusive recognition be revoked, any existing agreements be voided, and that the labor organization not qualify as a labor organization under this chapter for a period of twelve (12) months.

(b)  The employer and the labor organization, in fulfillment of their mutual obligation to bargain collectively, shall meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, salaries, hours, rates of pay, grievances, working conditions, and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written agreement incorporating the results of such negotiations if requested by either party, but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession. 
(c)  A party desiring to initiate negotiations for a new agreement shall notify the other party on or before January 5. At this time of notification, the parties shall inform the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of their intent to conduct negotiations for a new agreement.

(g)  The expiration date of all agreements shall be June 30 at midnight; provided, however, and subject to the annual appropriation of monies by the City Council, an agreement may be for a period of time greater than one fiscal year. 
(h)  Negotiations for a new agreement may extend beyond the June 30 expiration date of the existing agreement, and the provisions and benefits of the existing agreement shall be extended during the period of the negotiations and until the new agreement is reached, subject to the annual appropriation of monies by the City Council as provided in paragraph (e) above.

(c)  The fact-finding board shall conduct its hearing as soon as possible. The chairman shall be responsible for the conduct of the hearing. The parties and their witnesses shall appear and give testimony and produce the books, records, and other evidence relative to or pertinent to the negotiation impasses presented to the board.

ARTICLE XXVII. - SPECIAL EVENTS

Unregulated special events can create situations which exceed the City's capacity to provide adequately for security, public safety, health, sanitation, parking, water, medical care, lodging and waste disposal. Further, unregulated special events can harm sensitive environmental areas, create noise, congestion, and other nuisances which interfere with the inhabitants' peaceful enjoyment of their homes, businesses, and property. It is the intent of this article to regulate special events held on dates following the effective date of Chapter 13, Article XXVII Special Events.

The plan must provide measures that will be in place to ensure crowd control, protection of public and private property, and include steps to be taken to prevent trespassers from gaining access to the event site. The plan must include an explanation of how and when City of Norman police officers or private security officers will be deployed and where they will be located during, before, and after the event. The Chief of Police or his designee will determine the number of police officers and/or private security officers required based on the number of persons reasonably expected to attend the event and on any other reasonably reliable information regarding security risks, if any, posed by the proposed special event. 
(b)  The Fire Chief or his designee and a building official or his designee from the development services division must approve the proposed location and size of any fire lane, booth, tent, stage, and other equipment. The Fire Chief or his designee will determine the appropriate level of adequate fire protection equipment and personnel, if any, which will be required to provide adequate fire protection at the special event site. fire department personnel may conduct a compliance inspection at a permitted event.

(Ord. No. 0-9697-13; Ord. No. 0-9900-11; Ord. No. 0-0405-26; Ord. No. 0-0506-10) 
ARTICLE VI. - STREETS, CURBS, DRIVEWAYS, AND INTERSECTIONS 

Sec. 16-601. - Arterial street construction: Improvement responsibilities. 
    A property owner(s) is responsible for all costs of improvements to all arterial streets abutting his property in compliance with the City of Norman Street Standards and Subdivision Regulations, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 0-9697-31) 
Sec. 16-602. - Arterial street construction: Additional improvement alternatives. 
    A property owner(s) or the City of Norman, or both together, may improve arterial streets beyond the boundaries of the owner's property. Any such improvements, beyond the boundaries of the owner's approved development, will be voluntary and all costs will be paid by the owner(s), the City of Norman, or by both in any mutually agreed-to percentages, so long as such improvements are in accordance with the City of Norman's Transportation Plan. If other than City funds are involved, an agreement will be signed by all parties making such improvements and the City of Norman delineating the boundaries and scope of the project. Based upon the agreement or the declaration by the City, a map and a list will be made a part of this agreement, which will show all abutting properties subject to recoupment. 
(Ord. No. 0-9697-31) 
Sec. 16-603. - Arterial street construction: Recoupment of costs for additional construction. 
(a)  All eligible costs for additional improvements to arterial streets shall be recoverable by the owner, the City, or both as appropriate. Eligible recoverable arterial street development costs include the total improvement costs of the street, including, but not limited to, all right-of-way costs (both temporary and permanent) and costs for engineering, surveying, utility adjustments or relocation (unless utilities have been previously constructed by the property owner in accordance with City ordinances and regulations existing at the time of their construction), excavation, subgrade preparation, storm sewer installation or relocation (including culverts and bridges), four-lane pavement construction and turn lanes (in accordance with the City of Norman's Transportation Plan), signalization, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, lighting, signage, other traffic control devices and other amenities, as might be required, plus two (2) percent of the total of all above costs as an administrative fee to the City. It is the intent of this section to assess against an abutting property owner those costs that would normally be borne by the land developer at the time the recoupment project is declared. However, it is recognized that multiple funding sources are often utilized to complete arterial street projects and that the City does not intend to collect as a recoupable cost any funds in excess of those needed to complete the designated recoupment project. To that end, a recoupable cost shall not include those costs that are funded by general obligation bonds or funds from any other governmental entity which are not subject to repayment by the City. Further, proceeds from general obligation bonds that are to be applied to a voter approved project shall be applied pro-rata on a linear foot basis to all property owners abutting the project when calculating recoupable project costs. Any of the above items paid for by general obligation bonds or funds from any other governmental entity which are not subject to repayment by the City of Norman shall be deducted in determining the total recoupable improvement costs, except for right-of-way costs provided for in subsection (b) below. All other costs are subject to be recovered pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(b)  The City of Norman and/or the owner(s) who funded the eligible recoverable arterial street development costs shall be reimbursed for the total improvement costs of the street by the abutting property owners who are responsible for arterial street construction. The original funding entity(ies) shall recoup the appropriate pro-rata share for such construction. Additionally, the costs for all permanent right-of-way acquisition shall be charged back specifically to that property assignable to such costs, regardless of the source of funds used to acquire the property. 
(c)  All properties physically contiguous to the right-of-way line of arterial street construction occurring after the effective date of this article shall be subject to the recoupment program charges. The only exceptions shall be those properties which have previously constructed arterial streets adjacent to such properties according to City of Norman requirements or those which have made payments for deferred construction prior to the City entering an agreement or commencing design of a designated street. Those exceptions shall be exempt from the obligations of this article and the corresponding pro-rata share shall be the responsibility of the City. 
(d)  Each tract of property identified in subsection (c) above shall be subject to the total arterial street improvement cost participation expense equal to such tract's pro-rata share, any applicable permanent right-of-way costs, and inflation/deflation adjustment. Calculation of the costs for each individual tract shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Pro-rata share = 
;frac;a-b 
× d 
Where 
a = Total improvement costs, as identified in section 16-603(a) 
b = Total permanent right-of-way costs 
c = Total front footage of the project 
And 
d = Front footage of subject tract 
(2)  Right-of-way cost = Actual price paid for acquisition of permanent right-of-way from subject tract. 
(3)  [Inflation/deflation adjustment =] Adjustment of subsections (1) and (2) using an inflation factor calculated using the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index. The inflation factor shall be a percentage increase applied to (1) and (2) that adjusts the amount due for these costs. The initial inflation factor will be calculated by dividing the January 2000 value by the January 1990 value. To account for the actual time between adoption of the resolution and repayment of the obligation, the resulting increase will be divided by ten (10) and multiplied by the decimal equivalent of the period covered measured in years. The inflation factor will be recalculated every five (5) years with the first recalculation occurring in January 2005. The value of the inflation factor in place at the time the Council adopts the map and list for a project will be applied to that project until all funds are paid back or the obligation expires. 
The total payments calculated in the subsections (1), (2), and (3) above shall become a liability against property subsequent to the contracting for street improvements. All such obligations shall be paid in full before the filing of a final plat for full development of the property. It is not the intent of this section to prohibit the transfer of family estates to heirs either as a result of a death or a gift. For agriculturally zoned land the filing of a Norman Rural Certificate of Survey as a plat in accordance with section 19-606 of this Code will not require payment of the pro-rata share of the recoupment. It will however require repayment of the right-of-way cost for each tract. 
(e)  Within sixty (60) days following acceptance by the City of the completed improvements of the subject arterial street, the City Engineer, or his designated agent, shall prepare a tract map and list of the individually affected tracts and the estimated pro-rata share attributable to each such tract, hereinafter referred to as the "map and list." The map and list will also include all costs, if any, for right-of-way acquisition attributable to each tract. The map and list shall be made available to the owners of all fee interests in the affected properties. Notice of the map and list shall be filed of [on] record in the office of the City Clerk and the Cleveland County Clerk. Upon written request to the City Engineer, notice shall be given within a reasonable time to the requesting party of the most current estimate of the dollar value of the participation cost of any identified tract of property. Except with reference to the filing of notice of the map and list with the office of the City Clerk, nothing shall be deemed a defect preventing the City from collecting the applicable recoupment cost under this article. 
(f)  Any owner of a tract of property may, at any time after preparation of the map and list, cause the tract's total obligation to be paid to the City. Unless previously paid, the right-of-way cost and the pro-rata share attributable to each tract, with appropriate Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index adjustments, is due prior to the filing of a final plat for any portion of the subject tract with the exception contained in section 16-603(d) of this Code. If less than the total subject tract is being final platted, the pro-rata share for the final plat shall be the greater amount of either the percent of the total property final platted or the percent of the property frontage included in the plat. No such final plat shall be released for filing until the then due total costs are actually paid. 
(g)  Each identified tract of property shall be subject to participation in the recoupment program commencing with the date that the street improvement contract is approved by the City of Norman. As the total street development cost cannot be determined and notice of the assessment of same cannot be delivered until completion of the street improvements, the Director of Public Works of the City is hereby authorized to develop procedures for the review and approval, irrespective of the other provisions of this article, of platting procedures after authorization of the street improvements, but prior to the time that the property's total share of the participation cost is determined and can be paid. Such procedures are directed to include, to the extent feasible, the assurance to property owners and developers that plat approval may proceed so as not to retard the progress of private development plans, while, at the same time, to provide financial security to the City that the property's recoupment share will be paid upon final ascertainment of the amount owed. 
(h)  Unless earlier paid, each defined tract's share of the participation cost shall continue as an obligation of the property for its determined share of the total street improvement costs, plus the appropriate inflation/deflation increase as outlined in subsection (d)(3) above, for an through a period of fifteen (15) years from the date of issuance of the map and list required by subsection (e) above. Beginning at year sixteen (16) and continuing through year twenty (20), the pro-rata share shall decrease at a rate of twenty (20) percent of the pro-rata amount existing at the end of the fifteenth year until the pro-rata share obligation is reduced to zero dollars ($0.00) and thus terminates at the end of the twentieth year from the date of issuance of the map and list.

Once designated, a construction permit must be approved by the Public Works Department and Planning Department, subject to compliance with this section and the Administrative Guidelines approved with the annual contract. Advertising on benches or shelters is allowed after an annually renewable sign permit is issued at locations which have received a construction permit issued by the Public Works Department.

It must be a minimum of six (6) feet away from the curb or edge of pavement, and must be within one (1) foot to three (3) feet of a public sidewalk (if present). It may not be placed within any sight triangle, nor restrict access to aboveground or underground utilities.

If such sign is not in conformance with the existing law, such sign must be brought into conformance or removed according to procedures established in this Code [chapter]. Such sign shall be maintained in a good condition and shall be allowed to remain in existence so long as, and only so long as, such sign is not: 
(1)  Changed to another nonconforming sign, except that the colors and/or copy may be altered so long as the existing legal, nonconforming sign is not replaced with a new sign. An existing off-premise sign located within six-hundred sixty (660) feet of the centerline of I-35 which is registered with the State of Oklahoma and the City of Norman may be converted to a digital sign provided it complies with all of the requirements of Section 18-601, except for the one thousand-foot separation requirement contained in that section. A sign which does not meet the spacing requirement may be converted to a digital sign provided that it is located at least one thousand (1,000) feet from another electronic digital sign face which is facing the same traveled way. 
(2)  Structurally altered (except to meet safety requirements) so as to prolong the life of the sign. 
(3)  Expanded. 
(4)  Re-established after its discontinuance for ninety (90) days. 
(5)  Continued in use after cessation or change of ownership of the business or activity to which the sign pertains.

ARTICLE IX. - APPEALS, SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND VARIANCES 

Sec. 18-901. - Jurisdiction of Board of Adjustment. 
    Appeals, requests for special exceptions, and requests for variances relating to all other parts of this chapter shall be made to the Board of Adjustment according to the procedures set forth in chapter 22 of the Code. Appeals, special exceptions, and variances, as provided in other parts of this Code (chapter), shall be made to the Board of Adjustment prior to the erection or alteration of any sign. Violations of sections 18-301 and 18-402 shall not be appealed to the Board of Adjustment. 
(Ord. No. 0-9192-37; Ord. No. 0-0405-25, § 7) 
Sec. 18-902. - Violations. 
(a)  Any person who erects, alters, or maintains any sign in violation of this chapter shall be guilty of an offense. When a sign is erected or altered in violation of this Code (chapter), the Code Compliance Officer or his designee may issue a citation to the owner of said sign or his agent, sign contractor, or person having beneficial use or benefit of the building or structure on which such sign is located. Failure to remove the sign or come into compliance with the Code shall constitute an offense. 
(b)  In any prosecution charging a violation of this chapter, proof that the sign described in the citation was erected or altered in violation of this section, together with proof that the defendant named in the citation was, a the time the citation was issued, the owner of the sign, or person having primary benefit, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie presumption that the owner of the sign was the person who erected or altered the sign at the point where, for the time during with, the violation occurred. 
(Ord. No. 0-9192-37; Ord. No. 0-9697-1; Ord. No. 0-9900-11; Ord. No. 0-0405-25, § 7) 
Sec. 18-903. - Duties of Administrative Official, Board of Adjustment and Courts on matters of appeal. 
    It is the intent of this section that all questions of interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to an administrative official, and that such questions shall be presented to the Board of Adjustment only on appeal from the decision of an administrative official, and that recourse from the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be by appeal to the District Court as herein provided. 
(Ord. No. 0-9192-37) 
Sec. 18-904. - Special exceptions: Intent. 
    It is the stated intent of this article to encourage signs which are well designed and compatible with their surroundings. In particular, it is deemed desirable to promote and encourage the use of free-standing identification signs which are of a low profile, planter-type design when such signs are designed to complement the architectural style and design of the building to which they are appurtenant and to be compatible with the general area where the sign is to be located. 
    Additionally, it is recognized that signs are a necessary means of communication for the convenience of the public. There are certain types of signs which are not in common use throughout the City or are peculiar to a particular type of activity, and which are deemed to be desirable under controlled circumstances, for the public convenience. The general regulations of this chapter, however, are such that these signs (signs on theater marquees, collective identification or directory signs showing the names of various civic or religious organizations, bulletin boards, and kiosks located within pedestrian areas for the purpose of displaying posters and similar signs) are not generally permitted or are restricted in such a manner as to affect the utility of such signs. 
    Therefore, it is the intent of this article to provide a means of review and approval of special exceptions to the chapter provisions, whereby specified deviations from the general sign regulations may be allowed to permit the aforementioned types of signs, without need for proof of hardship; provided that the proposed size, location and design of such signs are compatible with their surroundings and consistent with the general intent of this chapter. 
    Furthermore, there may be occasions when a building or portion of a building proposed to be built in the City will, by virtue of its design, decoration, illumination or otherwise, exceed the maximum sign area permitted by this chapter. Therefore, it is the further intent of this article to provide a means for review and evaluation of such proposals in order to insure that the resulting construction is compatible with the general intent of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 0-9192-37) 
Sec. 18-905. - Special exceptions: When allowed. 
    Special exceptions shall be allowed to the following: 
(1)  The maximum allowable sign area for free-standing identification signs of a low profile, planter-type design, when such signs are designed to complement the architectural style of the building to which they are appurtenant; and when such signs contain no copy other than the name and/or street address of the use being identified and/or a logo-type symbol or trademark. 
(2)  Exceptions to the maximum sign area permitted on theater marquees in cases where necessary copy and a standard changeable letter size clearly necessitate such an exception. 
(3)  Exceptions to general sign regulations to permit the erection of collective identification or directory signs showing the names and locations of various civic or religious organizations in the community when such signs are not located on the premises of the uses being named; but rather are located in commercial or industrial zoning districts and are placed adjacent to major thoroughfares near entrances to the City. 
(4)  Exceptions to general regulations to permit the erection of kiosks, bulletin boards or similar structures and the display thereon of signs, posters and notices, when such structures are located within primarily pedestrian-oriented circulation areas and when such structures have little or no street or building frontage upon which basis permitted sign areas can be calculated. In certain instances, such signs may be erected within the public right-of-way upon review and recommendation to the Board of Adjustment by the Director of Public Works. Such structures shall be maintained in such a manner that only current material is displayed in an orderly manner. 
(5)  Proposals to erect buildings in commercial or industrial zoning districts which, by reason of design, decoration, illumination or otherwise, may be interpreted by the Code Compliance Officer to be signs. 
(6)  Exceptions to allow the erection of permanent ornamental identification signs at the entrances to specific identifiable areas in the City, such as residential subdivisions. 
(7)  The maximum allowable area for a free-standing ground sign for churches, schools (public or private), and other institutional uses that are located in low-density or medium-density residential zoning districts when (a) the size of the property exceeds forty (40) acres, (b) the sign will not be closer than two hundred (200) feet to the nearest property line of any single-family residence on the same side of the street, and (c) the sign is architecturally compatible with the principal building on the premises. In no case may the exception be granted for more than one hundred four (104) square feet (per face).

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 19-101. - Purpose. 
    The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of development. The regulation of land subdividing within a formalized procedure provides for the evolution of a contract between the land owner (developer) and a governmental entity acting in behalf of the public and for the benefit of subsequent individual owners and/or tenants. Precise commitments concerning a described geographic area of proposed development are specifically set forth in relation to and in accord with graphic and written documentation as filed of record. 
    The arrangement of land parcels in the community for residential, commercial, and industrial uses and for streets, alleys, schools, parks and other public purposes, will determine to a large degree the conditions of health, safety, economy and amenity that prevail in the area. The quality of these conditions is of public interest. These regulations and standards for the subdivision and improvement of land are designed to make provisions for adequate light, air, open spaces, drainage, transportation, public utilities, and other needs, to insure the development and maintenance of a healthy, attractive and efficient community that provides for the conservation and protection of its human and natural resources. 
    In construing this chapter, it is intended that these provisions be administered so as to create an environment which will provide the setting for the accomplishment of the best possible quality of life for all of the citizens of the City of Norman and in a manner that will insure the minimum adverse effect to the environment. 
    This chapter is designed, intended, and should be administered in a manner to: 
A.  Implement the Norman 2025 Plan in relation to: 
1.  The use of land and land use relationships; 
2.  The transportation system including but not limited to highways, streets, alleys, bicycle paths, bicycle lanes, sidewalks; 
3.  Community facilities including recreational and educational facilities, fire stations, etc.; 
4.  The extension or expansion of the sanitary sewer system including adequate easements to accommodate lines and facilities; 
5.  The extension or expansion of the water distribution system and the provision of fire hydrants including adequate easements to accommodate lines and facilities; 
6.  The appropriate disposition of surface runoff water; and 
7.  The accommodation of all other utilities within adequate easements. 
B.  Provide neighborhood conservation and prevent the development of slums and blight; 
C.  Harmoniously relate the development of the various tracts of land to existing development and facilitate the future development of adjoining tracts; 
D.  Provide that the cost of improvements which primarily benefit the tract of land being developed be borne by the owners or developers of the tract, as provided in these regulations; 
E.  Provide the best possible design for the tract; 
F.  Resolve any differences of interest; 
G.  Establish adequate, accurate and accessible public records of land subdivision; and, 
H.  Insure a maximum effort for the protection of the environment and to encourage, in the development of land, the minimum adverse effect thereto. 
    This chapter intends to require that all land located in the City of Norman be platted in conformance with these provisions prior to the actual accomplishment of development and that an approved final plat shall be filed of record prior to the issuance of a required building permit for the development of any and all institutional, industrial, commercial, and residential uses; provided, however, that variations and exceptions are accommodated in article VI of this chapter enumerating those cases where the full application of these provisions is not required.

The City also may exercise powers of subdivision regulation granted by the State in respect to matters of general State concern. 
(Ord. No. 0-7273-87; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-103. - Jurisdiction. 
    This chapter shall apply to the following forms of subdividing and/or developing of land within the corporate limits of the City: 
A.  The dividing of land into two (2) or more tracts, lots, sites, or parcels, any part of which, when subdivided, shall contain less than forty (40) acres in area. 
B.  The redividing of previously platted land into tracts, lots, sites, or parcels. 
C.  The development of land in a manner not in strict conformance with the plat and plans filed of record. 
D.  The dedicating, vacating, or reserving of any public or private easement through any tract of land regardless of the area involved, including those for use of public and private utility companies. 
E.  The dedicating or reserving of any street or alley or any part thereof through any tract of land regardless of the area involved. 
F.  Planned unit development as defined in this Code. 
G.  The development of any parcel of land classified by zoning district as single family residential, multifamily residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, or institutional. 
H.

    In order to provide adequate information for evaluation and decision by the Planning Commission and the City Council, and to provide documentation of intent for public record, the following requirements are mandatory: 
A.  A rezoning request which includes any amount of unplatted land shall be accompanied by a preliminary plat of the land in question, and any adjacent land which is fifty (50) percent or more owned or under option to buy by the applicant; provided, however, that any land for which a plat is not required as a prerequisite for a building permit is exempted from this requirement. The preliminary plat shall be submitted for consideration as an agenda item before the Planning Commission simultaneously with the rezoning request. 
B.  In the instance of proposed planned unit development(s), as provided in Chapter 22 of this Code, five (5) copies of a site development plan shall also be included with the submission of the preliminary plat when application is made for Planning Commission approval.

(Ord. No. O-9697-30; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-208. - Utility line extension: Additional improvement alternatives. 
    A property owner(s) or the City of Norman, or both together, may extend a water or sewer line beyond the boundaries of the owner's property. Any such improvements, beyond the boundaries of the owner's approved development, will be voluntary and all costs will be paid by the owner(s), the City of Norman, or by both in any mutually agreed to percentages, so long as such improvements are in accordance with the City of Norman Engineering Design Criteria. If other than City funds are involved, an agreement will be signed by all parties making such improvements and the City of Norman delineating the boundaries and scope of the project. Based upon the agreement or declaration by the City, a map will be made a part of this agreement which will show all abutting properties subject to payback. 
(Ord. No. O-9697-30; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-209. - Utility line extension: Payback of costs for oversize or extended utility main construction. 
(a)  All eligible costs for oversize or extension of utility lines shall be recoverable by the owner, the City, or both as appropriate. Eligible recoverable utility line extension or oversize development costs include the total improvement costs of the utility line, including all right-of-way/easement costs (both temporary and permanent) and costs for engineering, surveying, utility adjustments or relocation, excavation, backfill, subgrade preparation, pavement repair, utility line construction and other amenities, as might be required, plus two (2) percent of the total of all above costs as an administrative fee to the City. Any of the above items paid for by general obligation bonds or funds from any other governmental entity which are not subject to repayment by the City of Norman shall be deducted in determining the total improvement costs, except for right-of-way costs provided for in subsection (b) below. 
(b)  The City of Norman and/or the owner(s) who funded the eligible recoverable utility line oversize or extension costs shall be reimbursed for the total improvement costs of the utility line by the abutting or serviced property owners who are responsible for utility line construction. The original funding entity(ies) shall recoup the appropriate pro-rata share for such construction. Additionally, the costs for all right-of-way acquisition shall be charged back specifically to that property assignable to such costs. 
(c)  All properties physically contiguous to the right-of-way line of an arterial street containing a twelve-inch water line constructed after the effective date of this section shall be subject to the payback program charges. All properties which are either contiguous to a sanitary sewer line, taking service directly from that sanitary sewer line, or served indirectly through increased sewer capacity created as a result of the sanitary sewer line built after the effective date of this section, March 13, 1997, shall be subject to the payback program charges. The only exceptions shall be those properties which have previously constructed utility mains adjacent to and servicing such properties according to City of Norman requirements or those which have made payments for deferred construction prior to the City entering an agreement or commencing design of a designated utility line. 
(d)  Each tract of property identified in subsection (c) above shall be subject to the total water line oversize or extension cost participation expense equal to such tract's pro-rata share, any applicable right-of-way costs, and inflation/deflation adjustment. Calculation of the costs for each individual tract shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Pro-rata share = a - b / 2 x c × d 
Where a = Total improvement costs 
b = Right-of-way costs 
c = Total footage of the project 
And d = Front footage of liable property 
(2)  Right-of-way cost = Actual price paid for acquisition of right-of-way/utility easement from subject tract. 
(3)  [Inflation/deflation adjustment =] Adjustment of subsections (1) and (2) using an inflation factor calculated using the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index. The inflation factor shall be a percentage increase applied to (1) and (2) that adjusts the amount due for these costs. The initial inflation factor will be calculated by dividing the January 2000 value by the January 1990 value. To account for the actual time between adoption of the resolution and repayment of the obligation, the resulting increase will be divided by ten (10) and multiplied by the decimal equivalent of the period covered measured in years. The inflation factor will be recalculated every five (5) years with the first recalculation occurring in January 2005. The value of the inflation factor in place at the time the Council adopts the map and list for a project will be applied to that project until all funds are paid back or the obligation expires. 
    The total payments calculated in subsections (1), (2), and (3) above shall become a liability against property subsequent to the contracting for water line oversize or extension. For all single-family residential developments, all payback fees shall be paid in full before the filing of a plat. For all other developments, all payback charges shall be paid in full before the issuance of a building permit. 
(e)  Each tract of property identified in subsection (c) above shall be subject to the total sewer line oversize or extension cost participation expense equal to such tract's pro-rata share, any applicable right-of-way costs, and inflation/deflation adjustment. Calculation of the costs for each individual tract shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Pro-rata share = a x q / Q 
Where a = Total improvement costs 
q = Design flow for property sewer 
And Q = Design flow for project sewer 
(2)  Right-of-way cost = Actual price paid for acquisition of right-of-way/utility easement from subject tract. 
(3)  [Inflation/deflation adjustment =] Adjustment of subsections (1) and (2) using an inflation factor calculated using the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index. The inflation factor shall be a percentage increase applied to (1) and (2) that adjusts the amount due for these costs. The initial inflation factor will be calculated by dividing the January 2000 value by the January 1990 value. To account for the actual time between adoption of the resolution and repayment of the obligation, the resulting increase will be divided by ten (10) and multiplied by the decimal equivalent of the period covered measured in years. The inflation factor will be recalculated every five (5) years with the first recalculation occurring in January 2005. The value of the inflation factor in place at the time the Council adopts the map and list for a project will be applied to that project until all funds are paid back or the obligation expires. 
    The total payments calculated in subsections (1), (2), and (3) shall become a liability against the property subsequent to the contracting for sewer line oversize or extension. All such obligations shall be paid in full before the filing of a plat. Provided that the pro rata share shall not be more than the cost to construct a sanitary sewer line of adequate size from the point where service is available to the property. For purposes of calculating the cost of such sanitary sewer line, unit prices from the most recent City project using that line size will be multiplied by the length of a reasonable route between the property and the point where service is available. 
(f)  Within sixty (60) days following acceptance by the City of the completed improvements of the subject utility line, the City Engineer, or his designated agent, shall prepare a tract map and list of the individually affected tracts and the estimated pro-rata share attributable to each such tract, hereinafter referred to as the "map and list." The map and list will also include all costs, if any, for right-of-way acquisition to each tract. The map and list shall be made available to the owners of all fee interests in the affected properties. Notice of the map and list shall be filed of [on] record in the office of the City Clerk and the Cleveland County Clerk. Upon written request to the City Engineer, notice shall be given within a reasonable time to the requesting party of the most current estimate of the dollar value of the participation cost of any identified tract of property. Except with reference to the filing of notice of the map and list with the office of the City Clerk, nothing shall be deemed a defect preventing the City from collecting the applicable recoupment cost under sections 19-211-19-213. 
(g)  Any owner of a tract of property may, at any time after preparation of the map and list, cause the tract's total obligation to be paid to the City. Unless previously paid, the proportion of the right-of-way cost and pro-rata share attributable to that portion of a tract being developed, as adjusted by the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index, is due as follows. For any portion of the subject tract that is proposed to develop as single-family residential, the payback charges are due prior to approval of the final plat. For any portion of the subject tract that is proposed to develop as any land use other than single-family, the payback charges are due prior to issuance of a building permit. No single-family plat shall be released for filing until the then due total costs are actually paid. 
(h)  Each identified tract of property shall be subject to participation in the payback program commencing with the date that the utility line oversize/extension contract is approved by the City of Norman. As the total project cost cannot be determined and notice of the assessment of same cannot be delivered until completion of the project, the Director of Public Works of the City is hereby authorized to develop procedures for the review and approval, irrespective of the other provisions of sections 19-211-19-213, of platting procedures after authorization of the utility extension but prior to the time that the property's total share of the participation cost is determined and can be paid. Such procedures are directed to include, to the extent feasible, the assurance to property owners and developers that plat approval may proceed so as not to retard the progress of private development plans, while, at the same time, to provide financial security to the City that the property's recoupment share will be paid upon final ascertainment of the amount owed. 
(i)  Unless earlier paid, each defined tract's share of the participation cost shall continue as an obligation of the property for its determined share of the total utility line oversize or extension costs, plus the appropriate inflation/deflation as outlined in subsection (d)(3) or (e)(3) above, for an through a period of fifteen (15) years from the date of issuance of the map and list required by subsection (f) or (g) above. Beginning at year sixteen (16) and continuing through year twenty (20), the pro-rata share shall decrease at a rate of twenty (20) percent of the pro-rata amount existing at the end of the fifteenth year until the pro-rata share obligation is reduced to zero dollars ($0.00) and thus terminates at the end of the twentieth year from the date of issuance of the map and list.

Pre-Development meetings will be held on an as-needed basis, and are anticipated to occur once a month. Staff will notify all persons identified on the certified ownership list, and will include a copy of the written description of the proposed project as well as any reduced drawings. If an applicant does not submit an application for Planning Commission within six (6) months from the date of the Pre-Development meeting, a new Pre-Development meeting must be held prior to the Planning Commission hearing. 
At the same time, an application packet may also be submitted for a preliminary plat. By submitting both application packets at the same time, the application will be scheduled for a Pre-Development meeting, and then a Planning Commission hearing in the month immediately subsequent to the Pre-Development meeting. 
However, if the application for Planning Commission hearing is not filed in the Public Works Department at the same time the Pre-Development application is filed in the Planning Department according to the above deadline, the application will be scheduled for a Planning Commission hearing at the time that application is received in the Public Works Department. 
2.  In order to be included on the agenda of the Planning Commission, an application shall be in compliance with all of the following: 
(a)  Five (5) copies of the preliminary plat shall be submitted directly to the Public Works Department before 1:30 p.m. Monday, not less than thirty-one (31) days prior to the next Planning Commission meeting. 
(b)  It shall be unnecessary unless as may be otherwise required to submit with said preliminary plat the restrictive or protective covenants pertaining to said development or subdivision and which are to be filed of record in the office of the County Clerk of Cleveland County, Oklahoma. 
(c)  At the same time, where the preliminary plat is submitted for multi-family residential, commercial or industrial development, there shall be submitted five (5) copies of a site plan which shall be drawn to scale, with all necessary dimensions showing the outer lines within which each individual structure within the development is to be constructed, in addition to designated open space; the areas reserved for parking; all points of ingress and egress to existing, required, or proposed streets; all streets, alleys, drives, and firelanes, whether public or private; all public easements; the location of fire hydrants; service and dumpster areas; and required screening, landscape areas and fencing. 
(d)  When submitted, material must be in complete and final form as required in this chapter. Plats failing to meet these requirements by the filing deadline shall not be placed on the Planning Commission agenda.

E.  In the case of a plat proposing the reserving or dedicating of land or amenities to be used in common by owners of lots in a single-family residential subdivision, or in the case of a plat or Norman Rural Certificate of Survey that contains any portion of the WQPZ, the applicant shall submit evidence acceptable to the City Attorney that all necessary steps have been taken for: 
1.  The establishment of a mandatory Property Owner's Association ("POA") or establishment of another acceptable arrangement for adequate maintenance of the common elements and any designated non-structural controls for stormwater management. All mandatory POAs shall submit a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (the "Declaration") which establishes a minimum framework that provides for the fair and effective administration of the POA and thereby assures the greater likelihood that the interests of the City and its citizens are secure and which include the following provisions: 
(a)  A list of all common property in the plat, by legal description. A specific description of all of the common elements within the subdivision including any abutting arterial roadways, the uses allowed for each common element and a description of the person responsible for initially constructing or installing each common element and the responsibility for maintaining the common element after initial installation;

(c)  Once the declarant no longer controls the association, the declarant shall provide to the board of directors the following: 
(1)  All association books and records including minutes books and rules and regulations which may have been promulgated,

(d)  A requirement for annual meetings of the POA, with prior notice of the time, place, and agenda sent to each registered member of the POA, by mail or electronically; 
(e)  The POA shall have the power to impose and collect both annual and special assessments as well as capital reserves, and the ability to impose fines, penalties, and liens to ensure compliance with the terms of the declaration. The amount of the annual assessments or the methodology used to determine the amount and the manner in which changes in assessments are made must be disclosed. The developer shall provide a list of all of the capital components and their initial cost to the POA, and a statement from the developer's engineer or architect indicating the useful life of each such element. The POA shall maintain an annual "reserve assessment" equal to the initial cost of each component divided by the estimated number of years that each component is expected to remain useful, i.e. a ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) component with a useful life of ten years would require that $1000 be included in each annual budget, divided equally by the number of members in the association. 
(f)  During the declarant control period, the declaration may be amended as provided in the declaration. After the termination of the declarant control period, the declaration may be amended by the vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the owners of the lots within the subdivision. Any amendment which attempts to convey ownership or maintenance of a common element to a person other than the person designated at the time of the approval of the final plat by the City Council must be approved by the City Council;

Any denial of a proposed amendment may be appealed to the City Council; 
(h)  A statement that if the POA fails to maintain any common area that results in a code violation, the City shall have the right to perform corrective maintenance, after giving the POA thirty (30) days written notice and an opportunity to cure. The costs of said abatement are the responsibility of the POA and if such costs are not promptly paid, the City shall have the right to enforce such collection by all remedies available to the City at law or in equity; and 
(i)  Builders are required to permanently post notice in a prominent place in all model homes, sales offices, and all open spaces larger than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet stating that a Property Owners Association has been established and membership is mandatory for all property owners. The builder or his agent must disclose that there is a mandatory association and shall provide a summary of the association documents specifically including the annual assessments and a five year projection of dues income and association expenses, including amounts required for reserves. A current summary must be provided to all purchasers at least fifteen days before closing. 
(j)  All POAs must annually register with the City Clerk's office and provide a list of elected officers and their contact information or with the name and contact information for the agent or attorney of record for the POA.

2.  The submission of the Declaration or other documentation which reflects any change from the terms initially approved for review by the City Attorney and approval by the City Council if any of the foregoing City interests might be involved; and 
3.  The disposition of the common elements in the event of the dissolution of the POA. 
F.  The final plat shall conform with the preliminary plat as approved by the City Council, and shall not include the rerouting of a collector street, a change in the relationship between uses of land, an increase in the number of lots by more than five (5) percent, or a change of specific elements of the preliminary plat.

In all cases where the Development Committee approves a program of construction of required public improvements prior to the filing of a final plat, a copy of the final plat, without benefit of required signatures of City officials, shall be held in escrow by the City through the Public Works Department. It shall not be released for any purpose until the approved program of construction is completed and all public improvements are accepted by authorization of the City Council. Subsequent to the acceptance of all required public improvements included in the construction program and the accomplishment of all other commitments, if any, of the subdivider, the final plat shall be executed by the City and recorded at the County Courthouse. 
5.  An approved program of construction under this method shall be completed within a period of two (2) years. Two (2) years from the date of approval by the Development Committee, the approval of any construction program which has not been initiated shall become null and void. 
B.  Coincident with the acceptance of the final plat by the City Council of any public dedications within the subdivision, the subdivider may elect to submit an acceptable corporate surety bond, cash, certificate of deposit, or irrevocable letter of credit drawn on a banking institution qualified to do business in the State of Oklahoma for all required improvements. Vegetative cover should be planted when drainage improvements are installed, but may be deferred for up to six (6) months depending on weather conditions. Construction of sidewalks can be deferred for a period of two (2) years, or until on-site construction is completed. The procedure for bonding any public improvements is as follows: 
1.  Said surety shall be submitted to the Public Works Director. Said surety shall be executed on an approved City of Norman Bond Form, and be approved as to form and legality by the City Attorney. The terms of said bond (hereinafter referred to as a "subdivision bond") shall provide that it be conditioned that if the subdivider has not, within the stated period of time from the date of City acceptance of said subdivision bond, completed the installation of all required improvements within the subdivision, the subdivider and/or the subdivider's surety shall be required to forthwith pay over to the City a sum sufficient to contract, after competitive bidding, for the installation and construction of all said required public improvements not theretofore installed and constructed by the subdivider. Said sum shall constitute one hundred (100) percent of the cost of construction of the bonded improvements. 
2.  In the event that the subdivider is the principal on any delinquent corporate surety bond, the obligations of which have not been fulfilled, said subdivider shall be required to provide as surety, cash, certificate of deposit, or an irrevocable letter of credit as described above, for any improvement not installed and/or constructed by the subdivider prior to the filing of the final plat. 
3.  It shall be the responsibility of the subdividers posting any form of surety-bond, cash, certificate of deposit, or an irrevocable letter of credit-to inform the City of Norman, through its Director of Public Works when the subdivider's obligations under said surety have been fulfilled and to request release from the times and conditions of the posted surety. (See also section 19-316B.5.) 
4.  Any construction surety, regardless of form, shall be accompanied by a certified engineer's estimate, prepared by registered, professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Oklahoma, certifying that the bond amount is sufficient to cover the current cost of constructing the bonded improvement.

Sec. 19-316. - Completion and City acceptance of public improvement. 
A.  At such time as the subdivider has completed the installation and construction of all public utilities and improvements herein required within the subdivision, the subdivider may seek acceptance for all such improvements by the City. No public improvements shall be accepted for maintenance or for any other purpose by the City until or unless they are constructed in accordance with the City's "Standard Specifications and Construction Drawing" and "Engineering Design Criteria." The City Council shall authorize the Mayor to sign the plat and accept the improvements and dedications on behalf of the City based upon the certification by the City of Norman Development Committee that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and all bonds are in order and have been approved by the City Attorney. 
B.  The procedure for consideration of acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and maintenance bonds herein required shall be as follows: 
1.  The individual or legal entity responsible for causing a public improvement to be constructed shall make written request through the Public Works Department that such public improvements be accepted by the City. 
2.  One set of reproducible as-built plans and all required maintenance bonds shall be submitted in conjunction with said written request. As-built drawings shall also be provided on electronic media compatible with the City's computer-aided drafting and design (CADD) system. 
3.  The project engineer shall submit a written statement indicating that the plat improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved plans, that the as-built plans are a true and accurate representation of said public improvements, that the project engineer is satisfied with said public improvements, and that the project engineer recommends acceptance by the City. 
4.  The Public Works Department shall submit a written report to the City of Norman Development Committee indicating the following: 
(a)  That said public improvements have been constructed in compliance with approved plans and specifications and all requirements of the Code of the City of Norman; 
(b)  That the as-built plans provide a true and accurate representation of the public improvements; and 
(c)  That all required maintenance bonds have been submitted and examined by the City Attorney and are in order. 
5.  Upon the approval of the City of Norman Development Committee of the written report from the Public Works Department, the final plat and bonds shall be submitted to the Mayor for his signature and official acceptance of the dedications, improvements and required maintenance bonds; and, where applicable, release of the surety from liability under the subdivision bond where the provisions of said bond have been fully performed.

Sec. 19-319. - Procedure for amendment of site plans. 
    In such cases where a site plan has been required for a lot, tract or parcel of land by section 19-302C of this Code, and the proposed development of the lot, tract, or parcel deviates from the filed site plan, the site plan may be amended under the following procedure: 
A.  An amended site plan shall be submitted to the Public Works Department. 
B.  Such amended site plan shall conform to all of the requirements of the Code of the City of Norman. Further, the amended site plan may not deviate from the approved site plan by: 
1.  Adding more than five (5) percent to the gross building area; 
2.  Adding more than five (5) percent to the parking area; 
3.  Reducing landscaped areas by more than five (5) percent; or, 
4.  Changing the basic layout and configuration of building, parking, ingress, egress, or other conditions. 
    If the above conditions are complied with, and upon the unanimous vote of the City of Norman Development Committee and the Fire Marshal (or their designees), the amended site plan may be approved by affixing their signatures thereto. 
C.  Additional public improvements and amended improvements plans may be required as a condition of approval of the amended site plan where, in the judgment of the Director of Public Works, the Director of Planning and Community Development, or his designee, or the Fire Marshal, such additional public improvements are necessitated by changes in the amended site plan. 
D.  Any disapproved amended site plan may be appealed to the Planning Commission and subsequently to the City Council where by a majority vote the amended site plan may be approved. 
E.  No provision of this section shall be construed to exempt a tract from further platting as may be required by this chapter.

Sec. 19-320. - Procedure for amendment of final plats. 
    In such case where a final plat has been reviewed and approved by the City Council, the owner may submit, prior to its recording, to the City of Norman Development Committee an amended final plat. The City of Norman Development Committee may approve said amended final plat provided that there are no changes which significantly alter the layout, use, number of lots, or other material features of the plat. It is intended that such adjustments might include such things as minor lot configurations or slight adjustments necessitated in the field at the time of construction of improvements. If the unanimous vote of the City of Norman Development Committee concurs, then said final plat will be accepted and filed of record in accordance with the remaining procedures of this Code. Otherwise, any such change including any additional dedications of easements or rights-of-way will necessitate a review and acceptance on the part of the City Council.

ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN 

Sec. 19-401. - Design principles. 
    The quality of design of the city is dependent on the quality of design of the individual subdivisions that compose it. Good community design requires the coordination of the efforts of each subdivider and developer of land within the area. Therefore, the design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the principles established by the Norman 2025 Plan for land use, circulation, community facilities and public utility services and in accordance with the following general principles: 
A.  It is intended that the Norman urban area shall be designed as a group of integrated residential neighborhoods and appropriate commercial, industrial and public facilities. The neighborhood, as a planning unit, is intended as an area principally for residential use, and of a size that can be served by one (1) elementary school. Space for religious, recreational, educational and shopping facilities to serve the residents of the neighborhood should be provided and designed as an integral part of each neighborhood. 
B.  The quality of life in rural Norman is dependent upon the preservation of those environmental elements which form the basis for the initial attraction of rural dwellers. The purpose of cluster development is to provide for desirable and proper open space, tree cover, recreation areas, or scenic vistas; all with the intent of preserving the natural beauty while at the same time maintaining the same or higher maximum dwelling unit density limitations of each zoning district. To achieve these goals: 
1.  Variations in lot area are permitted, including development of lots smaller than those specified in the zoning ordinance. 
2.  Procedures are established to assure adequate maintenance and restricted use of open space areas for agricultural use or for the benefit of the inhabitants of the subdivision, or for dedication to public use. 
C.  The size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential, commercial, industrial and public uses should be designed to provide adequate light, air, open space, landscaping with living plants and off-street parking and loading facilities. 
D.  The arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical features. Tree masses and large individual trees should be preserved. The system of sidewalks, bicycle paths, and roadways and the lot layout should be designed to take advantage of the visual qualities of the area. 
E.  Circulation within the urban area should be provided in accordance with the following design principles: 
1.  Major streets should be located on the perimeter of the residential neighborhood. 
2.  Minor streets should be designed to provide access to each parcel of land under separate ownership and to sub-areas of apartment complexes within residential districts in a manner that will discourage use by through traffic. They should be planned so that future expansion will not require the conversion of minor streets to major streets. 
3.  Commercial or industrial subdivisions should have access to a major street by means of a street system designed for such use, but they should not have access to residential streets in such a manner that encourages or promotes the movement of foreign traffic through residential neighborhoods. 
4.  Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from other minor streets to the major street and expressway system and to provide access to public facilities within the neighborhood; however, collector streets should not be aligned in a manner that will encourage their use by through traffic. 
5.  Ingress and egress to single family residential properties should be provided only on minor streets. 
6.  Pedestrian ways should be separated from roadways used by vehicular traffic. Sidewalks should be designed to provide all residential building sites with direct access to all neighborhood facilities, including the elementary school, parks and playgrounds, churches, and shopping centers. 
7.  Bicycle lanes and bicycle paths, where provided, should be in accordance with the adopted Bicycle Plan. 
F.  Minimum standards for development are contained in this Code (including this chapter). However, the Norman 2025 Plan expresses policies designed to achieve optimum quality of development in the urban and suburban areas. If only the minimum standards are followed, as expressed by the various ordinances regulating land development, a standardization of minimum development will occur. This will produce a monotonous urban setting. Subdivision design should be of a quality to carry out the purpose and spirit of the policies expressed in the Norman 2025 Plan and in this chapter rather than be limited to the minimum standards required herein. 
(Ord. No. O-7273-87; Ord. No. O-8981-60; Ord. No. O-9697-43; Ord. No. 0-0001-15; Ord. No. 0-0405-27) 
Sec. 19-402. - Subdivision design standards: Alleys. 
A.  Alleys are not generally required in residential developments. 
B.  In commercial and industrial areas with lots greater than one (1) acre, alleys are not generally needed. Whenever alleys are not provided, definite and assured provision shall be made for utility easements, emergency access, and service access, such as off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
C.  If provided, alleys serving residential, commercial and industrial areas shall not be less than twenty (20) feet in width. 
D.  Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular movement. 
E.  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible and should be extended when abutting properties are developed. If unavoidable, dead end alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead-end, as determined by the Public Works Department. 
(Ord. No. O-7273-87; Ord. No. O-7576-17; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-403. - Subdivision design standards: Access and availability of fire and police protection and sanitation. 
    In the development of land, whether according to traditional patterns or under a variation of Planned Unit Development, adequate consideration shall be given to fire, sanitation, and police protection. Pursuant to this end the following guidelines are mandatory: 
A.  Each dwelling unit shall have an entry located not more than one hundred and fifty (150) feet from a parking lot, private drive or public street in order to provide access for emergency services. 
B.  In areas of the City where City water service is available, all building facades shall be serviced by fire hydrants installed in accord with standards and specifications of the Code of the City of Norman and so located such that totality of each facade can be serviced by not more than three hundred (300) feet of fire hose laid down by a fire vehicle. 
(Ord. No. O-7273-87; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Cross reference- Fire prevention, Ch. 9. 
Sec. 19-404. - Subdivision design standards: Blocks. 
A.  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to the following: 
1.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
2.  Zoning requirements applicable to lot sizes and dimensions; 
3.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic; and, 
4.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
B.  Blocks for residential use shall not generally be longer than seven hundred (700) feet, measured along the centerline of the block. When a block exceeds seven hundred (700) feet in length, the City Council may require a mid-block sidewalk within a dedicated easement not less than twenty (20) feet in width and a paved crosswalk not less than five (5) feet in width. Fencing may not be placed within the easement. 
C.  Blocks used for residential purposes should be of sufficient width to allow for two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth, except in those cases where one (1) tier of lots rears into a railroad, a major street as defined herein, or a different use area. 
D.  Blocks intended for commercial and industrial use should be of a width and depth suitable for the intended use, with due allowance for off-street parking and loading facilities and such blocks shall abut a street dedicated to the public on at least one (1) side. 
(Ord. No. O-7273-87; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-405. - Subdivision design standards: Building lines. 
A.  Front yard building lines and exterior side yard building lines shall be provided in accordance with the front yards and exterior side yards established for the various districts in Chapter 22 of this Code. 
B.  Restrictions requiring buildings to be located within the building lines shown on the plat shall be set forth on the plat or on a separate recorded instrument. 
(Ord. No. O-7273-87; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-406. - Subdivision design standards: Easements. 
A.  The subdivider shall dedicate to the public appropriate easements to the end that each and every lot, piece, or parcel of land within a subdivision shall have access to all utilities authorized by the City of Norman. 
B.  Where alleys are not provided, easements not less than ten (10) feet wide shall be provided along the rear of each lot and along side lot lines, where necessary, for use by authorized utilities. Aerial easements and easements of greater width for either the extension of main storm and sanitary sewers and other utilities or the accommodation of utilities in unique situations such as, but not limited to, lots rearing onto unplatted land may be required where it is deemed necessary on advice of the Public Works Director. 
C.  Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage channel, or stream, there shall be provided a right-of-way and access thereto for drainage, public parks, and public utility purposes. 
D.  Pipe lines carrying petroleum products shall be located in a dedicated easement. 
1.  Pipelines with a length greater than two miles will require an easement of not less than fifty (50) feet in width. The required easement may be greater than fifty (50) feet on the advice of the Public Works Director. 
2.  Pipelines carrying petroleum products from the well head to a tank battery or major pipeline will require a separation from a habitable structure no less then twenty-one and one-half (21.5) feet. When the concentration of Hydrogen sulfide gas exceeds three hundred parts per million (300 ppm) a separate hazards analysis will be required to determine the required separation. If the concentration of natural gas in the pipeline exceeds the amount carried in a four (4) inch pipe at sixty pounds per square inch (60 psi), the separation will be calculated using the formula w=0.69 × Sq root (y × p × d 2 ). Where w is the minimum separation in feet, p is the maximum rated pressure of the line in pounds per square inch, y is the weight fraction of natural gas in the pipeline, and d is the diameter of the line in inches. 
E.  In all subdivisions located in the A-1 and A-2 Agricultural Districts and in the R-E, Residential Estate Dwelling District, utility and drainage easements having a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet shall be provided adjacent to and outside of the designated right-of-way of all dedicated and private streets. 
(Ord. No. O-7272-87; Ord. No. 0-0001-15; Ord. No. 0-0506-40) 
Sec. 19-407. - Subdivision design standards: Lots. 
A.  Residential lots for single-family detached dwelling units and duplexes shall be not less than fifty (50) feet in width at the front building line and shall abut a street a distance of not less than thirty-five (35) feet, except that a corner lot shall be not less than sixty (60) feet in width at the front building line. 
B.  Residential lots for multifamily development shall be not less than fifty (50) feet in width, measured at the building line, for a single-family or two-family dwelling and ten (10) feet additional width for each additional dwelling unit occupying the lot, up to a maximum of three hundred (300) feet. Such lot shall abut a public street for a distance of not less than thirty-five (35) feet. 
C.  Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
D.  The depth of residential lots, other than townhouse lots or lots zoned R-1-A, shall not be less than one hundred (100) feet. 
E.  The area of residential lots shall not be less than that which is required by Chapter 22 of this Code. 
F.  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where they are needed to provided for the separation of residential development from major streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet shall be provided along the portion of the lots abutting such a major street or other uses where screening is required. These shall be no right of access across a planting screen easement, except where sidewalks and/or bicycle paths are deemed appropriate, and where individual lot owners wish to install a non-vehicular opaque gated opening not to exceed four (4) feet in width. 
G.  For corner lots, but not including those in midblock siding on crosswalk rights-of-way, a property return with a radius of twenty-five (25) feet or a twenty-five-foot cut-back with chord may be required; provided, however, if in the opinion of the Planning Commission there is an existing or potential future need, a larger radius or cut-back not to exceed forty (40) feet may be required. On lots reserved to business use, the radius of the return or an equivalent cut-back shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet. 
H.  Corner lots for residential use shall be at least ten (10) feet wider than interior lots. 
I.  In subdivisions for commercial and industrial use, lots should be of appropriate size and arrangement to provide for appropriate sanitation service, adequate off-street parking, and loading facilities based on the intended use and such lots shall abut a public street, frontage or otherwise, on a minimum of one side.

Sec. 19-409. - Subdivision design standards: Sidewalks. 
A.  All subdivisions or sections thereof within the limits of the urban area as reflected in the Norman 2025 Plan, as amended or to be amended, which were approved by the City Council after September 13, 1966, except those subdivisions within the A-1 and A-2 Agricultural zones, the R-E, Residential Estate zone, and Rural Cluster Developments under the Planned Unit Development Ordinance of the City, shall have installed in them sidewalks to serve each lot and parcel of land situated within such subdivision and, in addition, sidewalks shall be required in those unplatted parcels which are, or will be in the future, contiguous to subdivisions wherein sidewalks are required. Provided, however, that sidewalks shall not be required adjacent to local or collector streets within the I-1, Light Industrial Zoning District or I-2, Heavy Industrial Zoning District. Sidewalks shall be required adjacent to all streets abutting such industrial subdivisions and adjacent to any street classified as an arterial on the Transportation Plan which penetrates said industrial subdivisions. 
B.  No plat shall receive the approval or acceptance of the City Council unless provisions are therein contained for the installation of sidewalks as required by this chapter. On streets forming the exterior boundary of any subdivision, the developer or owner thereof shall be required to install sidewalks only on that side of such boundary street which lies adjacent to the developer's subdivision. 
C.  All sidewalks shall meet handicapped access requirements per Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or any successive federal requirements or standards governing accessibility.

B.  Residential development adjacent to an arterial street designated on the Transportation Plan shall comply with the following: 
1.  Only backing or siding residential lots shall be used adjacent to the above described roadways unless a frontage road is provided for local access purposes. This shall not apply to any residential lots two (2) acres or more in size. 
2.  Steel mesh fencing at least four (4) feet high with permanent evergreen plant screening, at least three (3) feet high, or an opaque fence approved by the City of Norman, shall be installed by the developer within the required screening easement at the right-of-way line behind or at the side of residential lots and shall be maintained by the developer for one (1) year from the date of installation. There shall be no openings in any fence for vehicular access onto the above described roadways except at street intersections, and at approved openings to commercial areas. 
3.  Subdivision streets shall not open onto an arterial street except at an average interval of not less than one-quarter (1/4) mile, measured from the centerlines. 
4.  The maintenance of all required fencing and the arterial right-of-way must be addressed by the developer. Maintenance shall be provided by a mandatory property owners' association or other acceptable arrangement. Such provisions cannot be changed without the express written approval of the City of Norman. 
C.  Commercial and industrial subdivisions shall provide access from each parcel to a major street by means of a street system designed for such use, but they shall not have access to residential streets in a manner that encourages or promotes the movement of foreign traffic through residential neighborhoods. 
D.  Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
E.  Collector streets shall be used in the subdivision wherever traffic is being collected from minor streets to provide access to a major street or community facility. Any street shall be deemed a collector street when it serves more than seventy-five (75) dwelling units. 
F.  Ingress and egress to multifamily areas having seventy-five (75) or more units shall be provided only on collector streets or frontage roads of appropriate design. 
G.  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land may be required. Such distances also shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separation structures. 
H.  Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is placed with the City under conditions approved by the City Council. 
I.  A tentative plan of a proposed future street system shall be shown on the preliminary plat. 
J.  When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate utility easements and connections for such resubdivision.

Sec. 19-411. - Water Quality Protection Zone design standards. 
A.  The Water Quality Protection Zone (WQPZ) for a stream system shall consist of a vegetated strip of land, preferably undisturbed and natural, extending along both sides of a stream and its adjacent wetlands, floodplains, or slopes. The width shall be adjusted to include contiguous sensitive areas, such as steep slopes, where development or disturbance may adversely affect water quality, streams, wetlands, or other water bodies. 
B.  The required base width for all WQPZs shall be equal to: 
1.  The greater of the following: 
a.  One hundred (100) feet in width, measured from the top of the bank, on either side of the stream; or 
b.  The designated Stream Planning Corridor as delineated on Exhibit 4-4 to the Storm Water Master Plan, dated October 2009, and accepted by City Council on November 10, 2009, and as available on the appropriate scale through the Public Works Department, or as indicated by the applicant's independent engineering analysis; or 
c.  The FEMA floodplain; or 
2.  An alternative width equal to twenty-five (25) feet in width, measured from the top of the bank, on either side of the stream when a reduction in nitrogen of at least seventy-five (75) percent and a reduction in phosphorus of at least fifty-eight (58) percent is achieved through the use of an engineered process that is certified by a licensed Professional Engineer. A development plan using an alternative width less than the SPC shall also document protection against flooding and bank erosion that would be anticipated during the one-percent-chance flood event in an given year assuming full build-out watershed conditions in those areas with forty (40) or more acres of drainage area in the Lake Thunderbird watershed. For the purpose of determining the applicable reduction in the base width of the buffer, the table below may be utilized to determine pollutant removal for a particular structural control, as long as such control is constructed in accordance with the specifications for said control contained in Wichita/Sedgwick County Stormwater Manual.

C.  For each portion of any twenty-five-foot segment of the buffer, as set forth in subsection 19-411(B), that has a slope over twenty (20) percent, twenty-five (25) feet shall be added to the width of the WQPZ. To determine the extent of steep slopes, a cross section of the topography every one hundred (100) feet shall be prepared and utilized by the applicant. 
D.  In second-order streams with continuous water or in higher order streams, twenty-five (25) feet shall be added to the base width outlined in subsection 19-411(B) above. 
E.  Drainage easements, of sufficient size to carry the runoff of a one-percent chance flood event from all drainage areas on the Plat greater than forty (40) acres within the WQPZ must be shown on dotted lines on the preliminary and final plats, along with a written legal description of any such easement, all certified by a licensed Professional Engineer. Such easement shall be granted to the City of Norman for the purpose of access for inspecting, repairing, and maintaining drainage channels. 
F.  For all developments, particularly those containing some portion of the WQPZ, utilization of low impact development strategies are encouraged. For plats or Norman Rural Certificates of Survey that include portions of the WQPZ, the current Engineering Design Criteria may be modified when Low Impact Development strategies are utilized in accordance with City of Wichita/Sedgwick County Stormwater Manual. 
G.  Water pollution hazards. The following land uses and/or activities are designated as potential water pollution hazards and must be set back from the top of the bank of any stream or waterbody by the distance indicated below:

(Ord. No. O-8384-24; Ord. No. O-8485-15; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-514. - Water quality protection zone management and maintenance. 
A.  All preliminary plats, final plats, and Norman Rural Certificates of Survey shall clearly: 
1.  Show the extent of any WQPZ on the subject property. 
2.  Label the WQPZ. 
3.  Provide a note to reference any WQPZ stating: "There shall be no clearing, grading, construction or disturbance of vegetation except as permitted by the Director of Public Works unless such disturbance is done in accordance with [subsection] 19-514(E) of the Norman City Code. 
4.  Provide a note to reference any protective covenants governing all WQPZ areas stating: "Any WQPZ shown hereon is subject to protective covenants that may be found in the land records and that restrict disturbance and use of these areas." 
5.  All subdivisions containing a WQPZ area shall ensure maintenance of the non-structural controls/aspects in the WQPZ area by its Property Owners' Association through the filing of a protective covenant, which is required to be submitted to the City Attorney's office for approval. The covenant shall be recorded in the land records and shall run with the land and continue in perpetuity. Any changes to the covenants and restrictions shall be consistent with the provisions herein. 
B.  An offer of dedication of a WQPZ to the City of Norman does not convey to the general public the right of access to this area unless such a right is explicitly set forth in said dedication. Further, an offer of dedication of a WQPZ is not a mandate for a public trail system or any portion thereof. 
C.  The Public Works Department shall inspect the buffer annually and following severe storms for evidence of sediment deposition, erosion, or concentrated flow channels and corrective actions taken to ensure the integrity and functions of the WQPZ. 
D.  Any portion of the WQPZ that is within thirty (30) feet of a combustible structure shall be maintained (regardless of the underlying zoning designation) as provided in Section 10-209.

(Ord. No. 0-1011-52, § 5) 
ARTICLE VI. - VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS 

Sec. 19-601. - Variations. 
A.  Occasionally the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements contained in this chapter would result in substantial hardship or inequity. The City Council may vary or modify, except as otherwise indicated, such requirements of design, but not of procedure or public improvements, so that the subdivider may develop the subject property in a reasonable manner. At the same time, the public welfare and interests of the City must be protected and the general intent and spirit of this chapter are preserved by granting such variance. Such modification may be granted upon written request of the subdivider or the subdivider's engineer, stating the reason for each modification, and may be approved by vote of the regular membership of the City Council, with the recommendation of the Planning Commission, subject to the acceptance of the plat and the dedications thereon by the City Council; provided, however, that a variation based on unique condition(s) shall not be granted when the unique condition(s) was created or contributed to by the subdivider. 
B.  WQPZ Averaging. The width of the WQPZ may be reduced in some circumstances to accommodate unusual or historical development patterns, shallow lots, stream crossings, or storm water ponds. Any averaging of the WQPZ must be done in accordance with the following: 
1.  An overall average WQPZ width of at least the base width as determined in [subsection] 19-411(B) must be achieved within the boundaries of the property to be developed. The WQPZ on adjoining properties cannot be included with buffer averaging on a separate property, even if owned by the same property owner. 
2.  The average width must be calculated based upon the entire length of stream bank that is located within the boundaries of the property to be developed. When calculating the WQPZ length, the natural stream channel should be followed. 
3.  WQPZ averaging shall be applied to each side of a stream independently. If the property being developed encompasses both sides of a stream, WQPZ averaging can be applied to both sides of the stream, but must be applied to both sides of the stream independently, unless the natural topography of the stream makes one side of the stream not conducive to the establishment of a WQPZ and in that event, averaging using both sides may be utilized. 
4.  WQPZ averaging is prohibited in developments that have, or will have after development areas that have slopes greater than fifteen (15) percent that are located within fifty (50) feet of the stream to be buffered. 
5.  Appeal from Decision of Public Works Director. If the applicant desires to appeal from the decision of the Public Works Director or his or her designee made in accordance with this subsection, the applicant may file such request, and any documentation supporting said appeal, with the City Clerk. The City Clerk will place the appeal on the agenda of the next available regular City Council meeting. The decision of the Public Works Director, or his or her designee, may be upheld or overturned by vote of the regular membership of the City Council. 
C.  Whenever infrastructure has been installed that will benefit the full build-out of a preliminary plat which was approved within five (5) years prior to the effective date of this ordinance, the preliminary plat shall not be deemed expired, for purposes only of the application of this ordinance, even after the passage of three (3) years from the date of approval of the preliminary plat, or five (5) years from the date of approval of the preliminary plat if a final plat has been filed on part of the land embraced in the preliminary plat. 
(Ord. No. O-7273-87; Ord. No. 0-0001-15; Ord. No. 0-1011-52, § 6) 
Sec. 19-602. - Exception for issuing a building permit. 
A.  Exception from Platting in A-1, A-2, and RE zoning districts: 
1.  In the A-1, A-2 and RE zones, building permits may be obtained on all tracts of ten (10) acres or more which abut on a minimum fifty-foot private roadway easement, granted to abutting property owners, which connects to a City street without the requirement to plat if the land and roadway easement were filed of record prior to February 7, 1984. The instrument which establishes this easement shall indicate that it is intended for future roadway purposes and shall not be accepted nor maintained by the City until and unless constructed according to the City's street standards. This easement shall contain a provision which expressly grants right of access to police, fire, sanitation, inspection, and health department vehicles and personnel who are in the process of performing their normal responsibilities as City, county, state or federal employees. All other zoning requirements for the particular zone in which these tracts are located shall be complied with and satisfied. 
2.  In the A-1, A-2 and RE zoning districts, building permits may be obtained on all tracts of five (5) acres or greater that abut a public street that is open, and which were filed of record on or before June 27, 1997. Prior to receiving a building permit to construct a new residential dwelling on such tracts, the owner must deliver to the City a duly executed roadway and utility easement for all adjoining public or section line roads which abut the property, in an amount sufficient to accommodate the proposed roadways as reflected on the adopted City of Norman Transportation Plan. Dedication is not mandatory for building permits which do not constitute a change of use, such as a residential addition, or which involve agricultural uses. For tracts containing more than forty (40) acres, the roadway easement would only be required adjacent to that portion of the entire tract that approximates a forty (40) acre parcel. Such tracts shall comply with all other zoning requirements of the City of Norman. The purpose of all such dedications is to facilitate the eventual improvement of rural roadways. Any private improvements within the expanded roadway easement may remain until a roadway project occurs, at which time the City would either pay for any existing improvements or institute condemnation action to acquire the real property as required by law. All existing improvements must be noted on the dedication. 
B.  Deferral of public improvements: 
1.  It is the purpose of this section to provide, in specific cases, as are hereinafter designated, a procedure whereby the City Council may temporarily defer the construction of certain public improvements required by the Code of the City of Norman at the time of acceptance of a final plat within a subdivision; provided that the City Council, in its sole judgment, deems that such deferment shall be immediately in the interest of public health, safety, or general welfare. It is the further purpose of this section to provide in specific cases where construction of required drainage improvements outside the boundary of a subdivision plat or other tract of land cannot be accomplished because the necessary easements or rights-of-way cannot be reasonably obtained, a procedure whereby the City Council may temporarily defer the construction of certain public improvements required by the Code of the City of Norman at the time of acceptance of a final plat and the associated program of improvements. 
2.  The City Council, after recommendation from the Director of Public Works, may accept a final plat and authorize the issuance of building permits prior to the construction of such deferred public improvements required by the Code of the City of Norman in the following situations: 
(a)  Where incompatible grades exist; 
(b)  Where there are inadequate or a lack of connecting facilities; 
(c)  Where construction of the improvement would not immediately function for its intended use; or 
(d)  Where such improvement would be replaced by a planned future project. 
3.  The City Council, after recommendation from the Director of Public Works, may accept a final plat and the program of improvements and defer public drainage improvements with the condition that the deferred drainage improvements are a part of the program of improvements but are the responsibility of the City of Norman to construct under the following situations: 
(a)  Where construction of required drainage improvements outside the boundary of a subdivision plat or other tract of land cannot be accomplished because the necessary easements or rights-of-way cannot reasonably be obtained; or 
(b)  Where documentation is provided which demonstrates that reasonable and proper attempts have been made to obtain the necessary easements and rights-of-way to construct the drainage improvements required by the City and that these attempts have been unsuccessful. 
(c)  Deferral of such improvements shall not result in any increased flooding of any street or habitable structure. 
4.  Whenever it is deemed necessary by the City Council to defer construction of any improvement, other than drainage under section 19-602B.3, the applicant shall pay the cost, as determined by the Director of Public Works, of future improvements to the City within ten (10) days of City Council acceptance of the final plat. Payment of cost shall be in cash or certificate of deposit. 
    In the case of deferred construction recommended under subsection 19-602B.3. above, the applicant shall make the following payments: 
(a)  An initial payment based on the engineer's estimate of the cost of construction as approved by the Director of Public Works plus the estimated costs of right-of-way acquisition and competitive bidding. The initial payment shall be in cash or certificate of deposit and shall be made within ten (10) days of City Council acceptance of the final plat. 
(b)  A final payment based on the actual cost of construction, right-of-way acquisition, and competitive bidding minus the initial payment. If the initial payment is greater than the actual cost, the difference will be returned to the applicant upon action of the Council upon request from the applicant. The final payment shall be in cash. 
5.  Monies received by the City under the authority of this section shall be separately accounted for and expended for no other purpose than in conjunction with the later construction of deferred improvement, except for deferred drainage improvements. 
6.  Monies received by the City under authority of this section for drainage improvements must be separately accounted for, but may be used for a drainage improvement other than the specific deferred improvement with the approval of the City Council if the proposed drainage improvement addresses a problem of the tract of land that the specific deferred improvement serves. The applicant is relieved of the obligation for the deferred improvement when its deferred funds are expended. 
7.  If construction of the deferred facility has not commenced within ten (10) years from the date of deferment, then the cost paid or the certificate of deposit may be returned upon action of the Council upon written request of the payor. 
8.  A deferment as contemplated by this section shall be submitted to the Development Committee for a recommendation of approval or disapproval at the same time the final plat is submitted. The deferment and recommendation shall then be submitted to the City Council for its consideration at the same time the final plat is submitted for acceptance. 
C.  Concurrent construction: 
1.  It is the purpose of this section to provide, under specific circumstances as are hereinafter designated, a procedure whereby building permits may be issued prior to the construction of all public improvements which are required by other portions of this Code; provided, however, that only a "Foundation only" permit will be issued until such time as the water portion of said public improvements have been completed, inspected and approved by the City of Norman Development Committee.

Sec. 19-603. - Exception to allow lot line adjustments. 
A.  The purpose of this section is to allow adjustments to be made to lot lines of platted lots for the purpose of transferring a portion of a lot to an adjacent lot. This process is not intended for adjusting large numbers of lot lines in a subdivision. Lot line adjustments are permitted only when adjacent property owners wish to transfer small amounts of land between each other for mutual convenience. 
    Said lot line adjustments shall be permitted for the purpose stated, but shall not violate any of the provisions of Chapter 22 of this Code or of the design and improvement provisions of this chapter, and shall meet the following conditions: 
1.  No additional lot shall be created by any lot line adjustment; 
2.  No lot line adjustment shall be allowed unless all required public improvements are either completed and accepted by the City of Norman, or their construction is secured under applicable requirements contained in this chapter; 
3.  All proposed residential dwelling sites contained in a proposed lot line adjustment shall have a width at the front building line which is equal to or greater than the narrowest width lot, measured at the front building line, which fronts on the same street as said proposed dwelling site and which is located within the same block, or is across the street from the same block, in which said dwelling site is located; 
4.  All proposed lots or building sites involved in a lot line adjustment shall have adequate utility easements and access to a public street; 
5.  Unusable lots shall not be created as a result of any lot line adjustment; and, 
6.  In the case of lots not served by public water and/or public sanitary sewers, such lots shall have sufficient area to properly accommodate a suitable private water supply and sewage disposal device. Appropriate tests shall be made accordingly, with adequate determination to be made by the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality and reported by it to the Engineering Staff. 
B.  Lot line adjustments shall be administered by a Lot Adjustment Committee composed of the City Engineer, the Building Official, and the Director of Planning and Community Development, or their designee. Each lot line adjustment shall be processed in accord with a standardized form and procedure, and be accompanied by a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each lot that will be adjusted. 
C.  The Lot Adjustment Committee may approve or disapprove a request. Approval of a request shall be by unanimous signed consent of the total membership of the Lot Adjustment Committee. Any disapproved request may be appealed to the Planning Commission and subsequently to the City Council.

Sec. 19-604. - Partial exception for plats containing three or fewer lots. 
    Whenever there is a tract of land of less than three (3) acres comprising the total area of a single ownership which is to be re-subdivided into three (3) or fewer lots where all required public improvements are in place and accepted by the City, the proposed subdivision may be exempt from the procedural provisions of this chapter and a preliminary and final plat may not be required; but this shall not constitute an exemption from any of the design or public improvement requirements contained herein. Provided, however, when public infrastructure as required in section 19-503 of this Code have been previously constructed and accepted by the City, the owner may request a partial exemption from the current standards from the City Council. Such request shall be accompanied by a report from a Registered Professional Engineer licensed to practice in the State of Oklahoma. Such report shall contain a complete accounting of the infrastructure that had been previously accepted and its ability to service the additional lots that are proposed. No exemption shall be granted where the health, safety or welfare of any current or future occupant or neighbor will be compromised by absence of adequate water lines, alleys, fire hydrants, sewer lines, screening or drainage. Exemptions which shall be designated as "short form plats" may be permitted under the following procedures: 
A.  An accurate survey of the tract, prepared by a land surveyor registered in the State of Oklahoma, and the proposed subdivision thereof shall be submitted to the Public Works Department. A site plan shall be submitted with the proposed "short form plat" in commercial and industrial zoning districts. 
B.  The following information shall be included for every oil or gas well, existing, inactive, or abandoned, as shown by the records of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), and/or permitted by the City of Norman, according to the records of the City of Norman Oil and Gas Inspector's office; 
(1)  Verify the physical location of the well bore with an accuracy of one (1) foot; 
(2)  All buildings shall be a minimum of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from the well bore of an active or unplugged well, or a plugged well not meeting the then current specifications of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and City of Norman Oil and Gas ordinance; 
(3)  All buildings shall be a minimum of forty-five (45) feet from the well bore of a plugged well meeting the then current specifications of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and the City of Norman Oil and Gas ordinance. 
C.  The Public Works and Planning staffs shall review the proposed "short form plat" to insure compliance with all design and public improvement requirements of this chapter and they shall prepare a written report thereon, which shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for consideration at the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission. 
D.  If the application is approved by the Planning Commission, it shall be certified by the signature of the Chairman of the Planning Commission and attested by the Secretary member. If the application is denied, the reasons for denial shall be stated in writing with reference made to the express provision of this Code to which the proposed "short form plat" does not conform, and a copy thereof shall be transmitted to the applicant. 
(Ord. No. O-7273-87; Ord. No. O-7576-15; Ord. No. 0-0001-15; Ord. No. 0-0304-57; Ord. No. 0-0405-27; Ord. No. 0-0506-29) 
Sec. 19-605. - Exception from platting a single tract for single-family residential development. 
A.  A building permit shall not be denied for single-family residential development to be located on a tract of land when all of the following conditions are satisfied: 
(1)  The total area owned by the applicant shall have been conveyed by a single deed prior to June 29, 1973, or prior to annexation as part of the City; 
(2)  All required street rights-of-way shall have been previously dedicated; and 
(3)  All required easements shall have been previously granted. 
B.  In all cases where required public improvements are not in place, the requirement for the construction of said required public improvements shall not be waived but the requirement to post bond shall be waived and the installation of required public improvements may be postponed until such time that an operational project can be accomplished by an improvement district. 
(Ord. No. O-7273-87; Ord. No. O-7475-21; Ord. No. O-7677-40, § 2; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-606. - Exception to allow Norman Rural Certificates of Survey as plats in A-1 and A-2 Zoning Districts. 
A.  It is the purpose of this exception to allow lots of ten (10) acres or more to be developed and sold adjacent to public or private roadways in the A-1 and A-2 Agricultural Districts; however, private roadways should be constructed and maintained in such a manner that said roadways may be traversed and used by police, fire and other official vehicles of all municipal, county, state and federal agencies. Lots created under this process shall be designated as "Norman Rural Certificate of Survey Subdivisions" and may be permitted under the following procedures (Ord. No. O-0203-34): 
1.  Any applicant contemplating a Certificate of Survey may voluntarily request a pre-development meeting, subject to the same filing requirements. The purpose of the meeting is to allow surrounding neighbors to meet with the applicant in an informal setting and share information about the proposed application. In order for the meeting to occur, the following items must be submitted to the Public Works Department: 
(a)  A copy of the deed to the property. 
(b)  A written description of the proposed development which provides details of the proposal that can be mailed to neighbors. The narrative should be as detailed as practicable, without being length[y] or technical. It should describe the proposed type of homes contained in the development, any proposed open space or parks, and connections to nearby major roads and subdivisions. 
(c)  Because this is a preliminary meeting, a fully finished Certificate of Survey is not required, however, three (3) full-sized drawings are required, as well as an eight and one-half (81/2) inch by eleven (11) inch reduction, generally showing lots, roads, topography, flood plains, existing easements and structures, physical features (such as pounds, creeks, and large stands of trees), and proposed open spaces and greenbelts. 
(d)  A certified ownership list for all property within a three-hundred fifty-foot radius of the exterior boundary of the subject request. 
(e)  A filing fee of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00), which will be credited against any filing fee charged for a future Rural Certificate of Survey application for the same property. This fee is non-refundable, and must be paid each time a separate meeting is requested. 
A complete application packet must be received in the Public Works Department by 4:00 p.m. seventeen (17) days before the regularly scheduled Pre-Development meeting. Such meetings will be held on an as-needed basis, and are anticipated to occur at least once a month. Staff will notify all persons identified on the certified ownership list, and will include a copy of the written description of the proposed project as well as any reduced drawings. 
2.  An accurate survey of the lot, prepared by a land surveyor registered in the State of Oklahoma, and the proposed subdivision thereof shall be submitted to the Public Works Department and shall show the same information required for a preliminary plat as referenced in Section 19-303 of this Code, except the ground contours may be drawn at five-foot intervals in such cases where the average ground slope is three (3) percent or greater. 
3.  The following information shall be included for every oil or gas well, existing, inactive, or abandoned, as shown by the records of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) and/or permitted by the City of Norman, according to the records of the City of Norman Oil and Gas Inspector's office; 
(a)  The location of the well bore with an accuracy of one (1) foot; 
(b)  All buildings shall be a minimum of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from the well bore of an active or unplugged well, or a plugged well not meeting the then current specifications of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and City of Norman Oil and Gas ordinance; 
(c)  All buildings shall be a minimum of forty-five (45) feet from the well bore of a plugged well meeting the then current specifications of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and the City of Norman Oil and Gas ordinance. 
4.  Planning and Public Works Departments' Staffs shall review and prepare a written report on the proposed "Norman Rural Certificate of Survey Subdivision" to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of the City's "Standard Specifications and Construction Drawings" and "Engineering Design Criteria" (Section 16-101 (a)). The applicant shall also submit for such review a certified copy of all instruments for the granting and maintenance of any required private easements and, by separate instrument, a duly executed roadway and utility easement for all adjoining public or section line roadways as reflected in the adopted City of Norman Transportation Plan. Staff's written report will be submitted to Planning Commission for their recommendation of approval or disapproval. 
5.  The Norman Rural Certificate of Survey will be forwarded to the City Council for final action. If the application is approved by the City Council, it shall be certified by the signature of the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk. Upon approval the developer shall guarantee the proper construction of the proposed development by providing the City with an acceptable performance bond with surety as required in section 19-314 of Chapter 19 of the City Code. All street and drainage easements and improvement plans as well as provisions for their maintenance shall be approved by the City of Norman Development Committee prior to the filing of the Norman Rural Certificate of Survey with the County Clerk, to ensure compliance with all standards referenced herein. Provisions for maintenance will be required through the establishment of a property owner's association and the deposit of a two-year, fifteen (15) percent maintenance bond in the name of the property owner's association. 
6.  Whenever the tract is of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict application of the private road standard contained in Standard Drawing No. ST28 of the "Standard Specifications and Construction Drawings" would result in substantial hardship or inequity, the City Council may vary or modify, except as otherwise indicated, the minimum street standard, provided that no more than four (4) lots or residences are served by said private roadway so that the applicant may develop said property in a reasonable manner, but so, at the same time, the public welfare and interests of the City are protected and the general intent and spirit of this ordinance [section] are preserved. Such modification may be granted upon written request of the applicant or the applicant's engineer, stating the reason for waiver of the private road standard, and may be approved by majority vote of the regular membership of the City Council. It is not intended for this waiver procedure to be applied to anything other than the width of private road standard required by this section. 
7.  The following additional requirements shall apply to all land containing subdivisions defined above which create private streets: 
(a)  Prior to the sale of any land within said subdivision, the subdivider shall erect, at all entrances to the subdivision, within the private drive and street rights-of-way, in a clearly conspicuous location, an enameled metal sign, no less than eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four (24) inches in dimension, with lettering thereon of no less than two (2) inches per letter in height, bearing the words: "CITY MAINTENANCE ENDS HERE." The sign shall be firmly affixed to a metal post no less than two (2) inches in diameter by two (2) metal bolts, which post shall be permanently set into the ground as required by the Public Works Department. Said sign shall be no less than four (4) feet above the surface of the ground and shall be maintained in good repair by the subdivider and by the owners of the property within said subdivision. 
(b)  No deed of conveyance shall ever be filed of record conveying any land within said subdivision until such time as the owner thereof has stated on the face of the deed, prior to its delivery to the prospective purchaser, the following language: "The property herein conveyed abuts on a private street which shall not be maintained by the City." Prior to the recording of any such deed, it must first be presented to and approved by the Director of Public Works and the Director of Planning and Community Development, or their designees, and no building permit shall be issued for the improvement of any such land until such Departmental approval has been granted.

Sec. 19-608. - Exception to allow private streets in Planned Unit Developments. 
A.  It is the purpose of this section to allow for the development of private streets in Planned Unit Developments approved under Section 22:432.4, subject to compliance with all other subdivision requirements contained in this Code. All such streets shall be reviewed, inspected and built to the same construction standards as public improvements. 
B.  All private streets, roads, and drives within said subdivisions shall be maintained by the owners of property within such subdivisions. The City shall have no responsibility whatever for their maintenance and repair. 
C.  Private streets, roads, and drives within said subdivision shall always remain open to police, fire, and other official vehicles of all municipal, county, state, and federal agencies. 
D.  The following additional requirements shall apply to all land contained in private road, Planned Unit Development subdivisions: 
1.  Prior to the sale of any land within said subdivision, the subdivider shall erect, at all entrances to the subdivision, within the private drive and street rights-of-way, in a clearly conspicuous location, an enameled metal sign, no less than eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four (24) inches in dimension, with lettering thereon of no less than two (2) inches per letter in height, bearing the words: "City Maintenance Ends Here."

ARTICLE VII. - PUBLIC PARK LAND DEDICATION 

Sec. 19-701. - Applicability. 
    This article shall apply to all residential subdivision plats having a dwelling unit density of greater than one (1) unit per acre, and/or the owners or applicants for approval thereof, pursuant to the authority of Article VIII, section 2 of the Charter of the City. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, all final plats submitted to the City from and after January 22, 1976 shall meet the requirements of this article, regardless of whether the preliminary plat had been approved before or after January 22, 1976. 
(Ord. No. O-7576-21; Ord. No. O-9899-31; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-702. - Dedication of land. 
    All persons, firms or corporations subdividing land under provisions of the Code of the City for residential purposes within the boundaries of said City shall, prior to the recording of their respective final plat, and subject to the other provisions hereinafter following: (1) Dedicate land to be used solely and exclusively for public park and recreation purposes or (2) Make an equivalent monetary contribution based upon a value of the land required to be dedicated, in lieu of the actual transfer of land; or (3) Dedicate land to a mandatory property owners association (P.O.A.) for private recreation purposes. 
    Whether or not land or money or credit shall be accepted by the City shall be at the sole option of the City Council. However, such option shall be available to the Council only if the total population for the pertinent preliminary plat, as projected under the provisions of this article, is less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) persons. 
(Ord. No. O-7576-21; Ord. No. O-9394-46; Ord. No. O-9899-31; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-703. - Reservation of future public park and recreation sites. 
    The Board of Parks Commissioners shall participate in the design of neighborhood master plans in order to approve of proposed public park and recreation land sites. Future public park and recreation sites as designated in the approved neighborhood master plans or as approved by the Board of Parks Commissioners and Planning Commission shall be delineated on the preliminary plat and reserved for dedication or purchase. A preliminary plat shall not be placed on a Planning Commission agenda until such plat has been reviewed by the Board of Parks Commissioners for public park dedication requirements. Submission of such preliminary plat shall constitute consent by the landowner for the City to zone all of such delineated areas into a "Park Land" (PL) zoning category, provided such preliminary plat has been approved. Uses permitted in such "Park Land" zoning category shall be limited to public parks and recreational areas; provided, however, that the grazing of animals and growing of crops may be permitted prior to dedication to the City. The Director of Parks and Recreation, upon request, shall inform the Cleveland County Tax Assessor of the property involved, that it has been reserved for the public benefit, and shall request that it be assessed on the tax rolls at the minimum value. 
(Ord. No. O-7576-21; Ord. No. O-9394-46; Ord. No. 0-0001-15) 
Sec. 19-704. - Standards for determining amount of land and/or fee. 
A.  The acreage to be contributed prior to the final approval by the City Council of any residential subdivision plat shall be determined by the following formula. 
2.5 acres × Each 1,000 person projected to occupy the fully developed subdivision = Amount of land to be contributed 
Which Is 
0.0025 acres × No. persons per dwelling unit × No. dwelling units projected for subdivision = Amount of land to be contributed 
B.  In determining the number of persons projected to occupy a subdivision the Director of Parks and Recreation in consultation with the Department of Planning and Community Development is authorized and directed to make such projections utilizing the following table: 
Zoning district Number persons per dwelling unit Number dwelling units per gross acre of subdivision R-1 2.62 5 or no. of lots in a final plat RM-4 2.62 11 or no. of lots in a final plat R-2 1.77 10 or 2 per lot in a final plat RM-2 1.77 13 or number of units in approved site plan R-3 1.77 15 or number of units in approved site plan RM-6 1.77 21 or number of units in approved site plan R-O 1.77 35 or number of units in approve site plan PUD Based on housing type Number of units authorized by ordinance  
The standards provided in the table above shall be used for calculating the number of persons per dwelling unit and the number of dwelling units projected for a subdivision. Standards for the number of persons per dwelling unit shall be based upon the most recent Federal Decennial Census. In the event that property zoned for multi-family use is platted for single-family use, the formula for single-family use shall apply. Should the approved site plan or final plat ever be modified to increase the number of dwelling units, an additional parkland dedication fee shall be due and payable. 
C.  In those instances where the formula used above shows that less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) persons will ultimately occupy any given subdivision as reflected by the preliminary plat submitted for approval, the Board of Parks Commissioners shall review said plat and promptly recommend whether land or money should be required of the subdivider. Such recommendation may be appealed to the City Council by the subdivider. 
1.  If public parkland is to be required, then the amount of land determined by subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be reserved and delineated on the preliminary plat in a location approved by the Board of Parks Commissioners and the appropriate portion thereof (as determined by the above formula) shall be dedicated or conveyed to the City at the time of recording the final plat. To insure that the appropriate portion of the delineated reserved parkland shall be acquired by the City whenever a final plat is recorded which embraces part of the land included in the preliminary plat, the following procedure shall be followed: Approval by the Planning Commission of a preliminary plat wherein dedication of public parkland is required shall be conditional on the subdivider delivering to the City a fully executed "parkland reservation" in a form prescribed by the City Council. Such "parkland reservation" shall be submitted with the preliminary plat and be acknowledged by the subdivider before a notary public and shall meet the following standards: 
(a)  It must give a legal description of the entire area embraced within the preliminary plat; 
(b)  It must give a legal description of the delineated land and recite that such land is reserved for dedication or conveyance to the City of Norman for public park and recreational purposes, pursuant to the Charter and the Code of the City; 
(c)  It must warrant that the subdivider is the owner of all land embraced in the preliminary plat and, further, that the land delineated and reserved for public park and recreational purposes will be conveyed to the City free and clear of any mortgages, liens or encumbrances; 
(d)  It must recite that whenever a final plat is recorded covering any part of the land embraced within the preliminary plat, a proportionate part of the reserved parkland shall be dedicated and conveyed in fee to the City and the owner of such proportionate part shall be estopped to deny the right of the City to acquire title to such proportionate part; 
(e)  It must be accepted by the City Council and filed for record with the Cleveland County Clerk with filing costs being paid by the subdivider. 
Whenever the parkland dedication requirements of the Charter and Code of the City have been satisfied as to any preliminary plat upon which a "parkland reservation" has been filed, the Council shall cause notice of satisfaction and release of the reservation to be executed and filed with the Cleveland County Clerk. 
2.  If a fee in lieu of a land contribution is required, the amount of fee shall be determined at the time of final platting, according to the following formula: 
Fair market value of land per acre × Amount of land required to be dedicated according to subsections (a) and (b) of this section = Fee in lieu of land dedication 
The subdivider shall tender and pay over to the City a cashier's check for such fee immediately prior to recording the final plat. 
(a)  Time of determining the value of land. The fair market value of the land shall be determined no more than six (6) months before submission of the final plat to the City Council. 
(b)  Basis for determining the value of land. The representative cash value of the land that would otherwise be required to be dedicated shall be the full and fair market value of the raw land plus a proportionate share of those incidental costs as defined in section 19-705C. which would be attached to a subdivider in those cases where land itself was given. Such value shall be determined by averaging the value of all residentially zoned acreage in the preliminary plat. 
(c)  Method of determining value of land. The fair market value shall be determined by negotiations between the subdivider and the City. If negotiations have failed to reach agreement by the time the final plat is submitted, then within five (5) days an Appraisal Board shall be appointed to determine the fair market value, whose appraisal shall be final and binding on both parties. The Appraisal Board shall consist of three (3) qualified real estate appraisers, one (1) selected by the City, one (1) selected by the subdivider, and one (1) selected by the chosen appraisers. The appraisers' fee shall be paid jointly by the City and the subdivider. Within ten (10) days, the Appraisal Board shall tender a report of the fair market value of the land as of the date the Appraisal Board was appointed. 
D.  Instead of dedicating land for a public park or paying a fee in lieu of such land, the developer may choose to dedicate land for park or open space to a private property owners association. Such option shall be indicated on the preliminary plat submitted for approval by the Board of Park Commissioners. 
1.  If private parkland is proposed, then twice the amount of land determined by subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be reserved and delineated on the preliminary plat. 
2.  Recognizing that a wide variety of recreational opportunities may demand different types of open space, land that may not meet all of the suitability standards of public parkland contained in section 19-705 could be utilized as private open space. Nevertheless, certain areas may not be counted as an acceptable substitute for public park areas. No floodplain area, detention pond, drainage way, or water body shall be countable, although circulation areas around or through such areas may be counted if such are reasonably flat and are not inundated during storm events and are at least ten (10) feet wide. 
3.  All such open spaces must be contained in an area that is, or will be, dedicated to a mandatory property owners association. Restrictive covenants running with the land shall be submitted with any final plat indicating that the mandatory property owners association shall remain perpetually responsible for the maintenance of all common areas indicated on the preliminary and final plat. Covenants affecting any common park and open space areas may not be changed without the express approval of the City Council. 
Submission of any preliminary plat containing private open space which is to substitute for public parkland shall constitute consent by the landowner for the City to zone all of the delineated open spaces into a "Park Land" (PL) zoning category. 
E.  In such case as the Council, upon the recommendation of the Board of Parks Commissioners, shall determine, a subdivider may dedicate more land than would be required by the formulas herein set out and receive a written credit against future mandatory public parkland dedications. Where a subdivider dedicates land against future requirements, the development which is thereby relieved of all or part of its mandatory parkland dedication requirement must be in the same general area as that served by the dedicated credit land, such general area to be at the City's sole determination. The credit shall attach to the relieved land and remain with the relieved land, regardless of change in ownership thereof. 
F.  In the event a subdivider deviates from the approved preliminary plat in final platting or rezones land within the preliminary plat which has the effect of increasing the density of population over the earlier population density estimates made under this article or where the use of property is changed from a nonresidential use to a residential use the owner or subdivider shall be obligated to provide additional land or fee to compensate for the increase in population prior to the City issuing a building permit or occupancy permit.

Sec. 19-705. - Suitability of the land. 
    Any land to be dedicated for public park purposes to meet the requirements of this article shall be reasonably located and adaptable for use as an active neighborhood public park and recreation facility. Such determination shall be made by the Board of Park Commissioners, whose decision may be appealed to the City Council. Factors to be used in evaluating the adequacy of the proposed public park and recreation areas include, but are not limited to, the following: 
A.  Unity: The dedicated land should form a single parcel or tract of land at least five (5) acres in size unless the Board of Parks Commissioners determined that a smaller tract would be in the public interest, or that additional contiguous land will be reasonably available for dedication to or purchase by the City. 
B.  Shape: The shape of the parcel or tract of land to be dedicated should be appropriate for public parks and recreation purposes. 
C.  Access: Public access to public park land delineated on a preliminary plat shall be insured by provision of at least fifty (50) feet of street frontage, in a manner satisfactory to the Board of Parks Commissioners. At the time the land abutting the delineated areas is developed, the subdivider of such abutting land shall furnish and pay for paving all abutting street frontage and shall provide water and sewer access to the boundary of one (1) side of the delineated area to meet minimum requirements as determined by the Public Works Department. 
D.  Topography: The land to be dedicated to meet the requirement of this article should be suitable for public parks and recreation activities. In that regard fifty (50) percent of the dedicated land area should not exceed five (5) percent grade. The Parks and Recreation Department's Five Year Plan and the General Plan for the City of Norman shall be considered when evaluating land proposals for dedication.

Sec. 19-706. - Use of money paid in lieu of dedicating of land. 
A.  A separate fund to be deposited at the highest interest rate permitted by law to be entitled "park fee fund" shall be and is hereby created and the money paid in by owners, subdividers, and applicants at final approval of subdivision plats in lieu of the dedication of land and interest thereon, shall be held in such fund in trust to be used solely and exclusively for the purpose of purchasing or improving public neighborhood park and recreational land in the general area in which the subdivision is located. 
B.  At such time as the Council, based upon the recommendations of the Board of Parks Commissioners, determines that there are sufficient funds derived from a certain area in the park fee fund to purchase usable parkland, the Council shall cause negotiations to be undertaken to purchase the site by mutual agreement or by condemnation proceedings. In making such determination for the purchase of said site, the conditions of section 19-705 above shall be taken into consideration. The principal and interest deposited and kept in the park fee fund shall be used solely for the purpose of purchasing land or providing improvements for public neighborhood park and recreation uses, as provided in subsection C. and shall never be used for maintaining or operating public park facilities, or for any other purpose. 
C.  The use of funds for park improvements, as provided in subsections A. and B. above described, may occur only when a neighborhood park has reached its maximum size or is otherwise surrounded by existing development. The City Council, upon the recommendation of the Board of Parks Commissioners, may utilize any new park fee dedications, including accrued interest, to construct park improvements within that neighborhood park.

A.  By dedication within the plat to be filed for record in the Office of the County Clerk of Cleveland County, Oklahoma; and 
B.  By special warranty deed transferring the property in fee simple to the City of Norman. 
    In any event, land must be free and clear of any mortgages, liens or encumbrances at the time of such dedication or conveyance.

because of the presence of existing overhead utility facilities in a substantial portion of the area
within or surrounding the new addition or subdivision.
(2) Underground construction would not be practicable or feasible due to the nature of the services
to be rendered or required, the soil or rock formations in the area, unusual rodent or animal
infestation, the presence of existing impeding underground drainage ditches, open storm
sewers and impediments of like nature, or because of some other unusual circumstances.
(3) The cost of the installation will be unduly burdensome or confiscatory when compared with
the revenue which could reasonably be anticipated therefrom.

ARTICLE XI. SPECIFIC DISTRICT REGULATIONS
SEC. 420 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
(Ord. No. O-9091-40  July 23, 1991; O-1718-14  December 28, 2017; O-1718-47  July 26, 2018; O-
1718-51  August 23, 2017)
1. Statement of Purpose. It is the intent of this section to encourage developments with a superior built
environment brought about through unified development and to provide for the application of design
ingenuity in such developments while protecting existing and future surrounding areas in achieving the
goals of the comprehensive plan of record. The "PUD" Planned Unit Development district herein
established is intended to provide for greater flexibility in the design of buildings, yards, courts, circulation,
and open space than would otherwise be possible through the strict application of other district regulations.
In this way, applicants may be awarded certain premiums in return for assurances of overall planning and
design quality, or which will be of exceptional community benefit and which are not now required by other
regulations. By permitting and encouraging the use of such procedures, the Planning Commission and City
Council will be able to make more informed land use decisions and thereby guide development more
effectively in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the City.
Specifically, the purposes of this section are to encourage:
(a) A maximum choice in the types of environment and living units available to the public.
(b) Provision of more usable and suitably located open space, recreation areas, or other common
facilities than would otherwise be required under conventional land development regulations.
(c) Maximum enhancement and minimal disruption of existing natural features and amenities.
(d) Comprehensive and innovative planning and design of diversified developments which are
consistent with the City's long range plan and remain compatible with surrounding
developments.
(e) More efficient and economic use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets,
thereby lowering costs.
(f) Preparation of more complete and useful information which will enable the Planning
Commission and City Council to make more informed decisions on land use.
The PUD (Planned Unit Development) Regulations are designed to provide for small and large scale
developments incorporating a single type or a variety of residential, commercial, industrial and related uses
which are planned and developed as a unit. Such development may consist of individual lots, or it may
have common building sites. Private or public common land and open space must be an essential, major
element of the development which is related to, and affects, the long term value of the homes and other
development. A Planned Unit Development shall be a separate entity with a distinct character that respects
and harmonizes with surrounding development.
2. Uses Permitted. In addition to zoning districts established elsewhere in this chapter, a Planned Unit
Development zoning district is established and shall be designated on the Zoning District Map, upon
application of the landowner and approval by the City Council. In order to increase creativity and
flexibility in the development of areas suitable for a Planned Unit Development, there are no specifically
prescribed uses which are permitted within the boundaries of a Planned Unit Development. The developer
shall be responsible for preparation of a list of permitted uses within the specific Planned Unit
Development requested. The development of the list shall take into account the nature and purpose of the
Planned Unit Development area, and such uses and locations shall be appropriate in order to protect and be
in harmony with surrounding development. At the time of the Pre-Application plan and conference, the
applicant shall generally describe the nature and types of land uses to be located within the boundaries of
the PUD District. At the time of zoning application and consideration of the preliminary plat, a specific
written list of uses to be "permitted by right" shall be submitted for review by the Planning Commission.
Following approval by the Planning Commission and City Council, the list of specific uses permitted by
right shall serve as the control list in issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy.
11
22:420 (PUD)
In addition to the above permitted uses that are established by right, certain other uses may be prescribed
by the developer in accordance with the restrictions included herein and said uses are designated as
Conditional Permit Uses. These uses more intensely dominate the area in which they are located than do
other uses which might be permitted in the PUD District and, as such, they require special considerations
and restrictions. If the developer and/or Planning Commission agree that certain conditional permit uses
should be included within the PUD District, the applicant shall precisely indicate the specific use, its
location, area to be included, maximum building square footage, and such other information as required by
the Planning Commission to properly and comprehensively evaluate the nature and impact of such
conditional permit uses. When such conditional permit uses are approved at the time of rezoning, they
shall not be subsequently changed to any other use until and unless they are changed to another use that is
permitted by right, or the new proposed use if not permitted by right in a PUD District is resubmitted for
rezoning approval.
3. Standards of Development.
(a) Ownership control. Applicants eligible for preliminary plan review must be the landowners of
record, holders of a lease for not less than fifty (50) years, or their authorized agent and
beneficiaries of all properties in question. The approved final development plan shall be
binding on all subsequent owners of the land until revised or repealed as authorized in this
section.
(b) Minimum District Area. Eligible properties must be five (5) acres or larger in size (gross
acreage).
(c) Parking and off-street loading. All uses established within a Planned Unit Development shall
provide standards for off-street parking and loading and related landscaping provisions which
generally follow the regulations found in Sections 431.5, 431.7 and 431.8 and are found to
provide adequate parking and landscaping for the uses proposed. However, the requirements
for individual structures or lots may be met through either provision of adequate parking on
the lot on which structure is so located, or upon adjacent property which is under the control of
a property owners' association to which said lot is an automatic participant.
(d) Perimeter requirements. In order to assure compatibility with surrounding development, the
developer shall submit specific information as to the setbacks, building height, coverage
factors and other elements necessary for all perimeter lots that are adjacent to the boundary of
the PUD District, or adjacent to any boundary or perimeter street right-of-way. While no
specific setback requirements are herein established, the Planning Commission shall consider
the nature, extent and character of the adjacent development and shall take into consideration
the types of area regulations applicable to those adjacent properties.
(e) Open Space requirements. Common open space constitutes an essential ingredient in a
Planned Unit Development and is one of the most basic and important design elements. Open
space should be distributed more or less equitably throughout the PUD District in relationship
to the dwelling units and other use areas that are intended to be served by the common open
space. Adequate guarantees must be provided that the common open space areas are preserved
and maintained for those purposes only. A property owners' association shall be required if
other arrangements satisfactory to the City have not been made, for improving, operating and
maintaining all such common open space areas, and other communally owned facilities. Open
space shall be evaluated utilizing the following general guidelines:
(1) A minimum of ten to fifteen percent (10% to 15%) of the gross acres of any residential
Planned Unit Development shall be designated as common open space;
(2) No more than one-half of the common open space may be covered by water;
(3) Recreation facilities or structures and their accessory uses located in common areas shall
be considered as usable open space as long as the total impervious surfaces such as
paving and roofs constitute no more than ten percent (10%) of the total open space; and
12
22:420 (PUD)
(4) A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the gross area of the non-residential components of
any Planned Unit Developments shall be designated as landscaped open space, not to be
used for streets or parking.
(f) Property Owners' Associations. The developer shall create such legal entities as appropriate to
undertake and be responsible for the ownership, operation, construction and maintenance of
private roads, parking areas, common usable open space, community facilities, recreation
areas, buildings, lighting, security measures, and similar common elements in a Planned Unit
Development. All legal instruments setting forth a plan or manner of permanent care and
maintenance of such open space, recreational areas, and communally owned facilities shall be
approved by the City Attorney as to legal form and affect, and by City Council as to the
suitability of the proposed use of the open areas.
(g) Within the Central Core Area of Norman (see map exhibit to Sec. 431.7), any two-family
(duplex) structure with four or more bedrooms per unit is required to be sprinkled per the
requirement in Section P2904 of the International Residential Code (IRC) or NFPA 13D, or as
these documents are amended. (O-1718-47)
(h) A theater, including one that sells alcoholic beverages in compliance with state law,
may be incorporated into appropriate Planned Unit Developments. (O-1718-51)
4. Application Procedures. The Planned Unit Development application procedure shall consist of three
phases.
(a) Preapplication conference. Before submitting an application for any Planned Unit
Development, the landowner, or his authorized agent, shall confer with City Staff in order to
become familiar with the Planned Unit Development Review Process. The Staff will inform
the applicant of any perceived potential problems that might arise. A further purpose of the
preapplication conference is to make sure that the applicant has, or will be able to submit, the
necessary information for filing the application. The intent of this conference is to provide
guidance to the applicant prior to incurring substantial expense in the preparation of detailed
plans, surveys and other data required in a preliminary development plan. After the
preapplication conference, the proposed development may be heard before the Planning
Commission as an informational item. At the conference, the applicant shall submit a site plan
and such other narrative or other graphic information the applicant deems pertinent to the
City's initial review and evaluation of the potential of the Planned Unit Development
proposed. The preapplication plan shall include the following:
(1) Boundaries of the property involved;
(2) Existing zoning of the area and zoning of adjoining properties;
(3) Existing roadways, easements and waterways;
(4) A general plan of development at a level of detail sufficient to indicate to the City the
nature and scope of the project as to its magnitude in terms of approximate number and
types of dwelling units, location and extent of non-residential elements, proposed
locations of major open space areas, and major circulation facilities; and
(5) Proposed treatment of the perimeter of the Planned Unit Development.
(b) Zoning application. After receiving written comments following the preapplication
conference, the applicant may proceed in preparing a formal application for a Planned Unit
Development. The application shall consist of a simultaneous submission of a rezoning
application, Preliminary Plat, and proposed Development Plan. The Preliminary Plat shall
conform to all requirements contained in Chapter 19 of the Norman City Code, with the
exception of certain design requirements regarding lot dimensions, setbacks, etc., that are
specifically exempted or modified by provisions of this ordinance.
13
22:420 (PUD)
In addition to the required Preliminary Plat, the Rezoning Application/Development Plan shall
include at least the following information:
(1) Proposed title of the project and name of any engineer, architect, land planner, landscape
architect, or company responsible for various elements of the plan.
(2) General development plan of the tract indicating the location of different land uses,
dwellings by types and numbers, areas designated for commercial, industrial and other
non-residential uses, and areas proposed for open space and recreational use. For all
residential areas, the site plan shall clearly indicate the type and number of dwellings to
be located per parcel, lot or block in accordance with the Preliminary Plat. For all
commercial and other non-residential uses, the areas shall clearly be indicated in
accordance with lots, parcels or blocks; and, each such parcel shall indicate the type of
building proposed, the use of any proposed building, number of stories, and gross square
footage to be included on each parcel. The boundaries of all open space areas shall be
clearly indicated, along with the form of proposed ownership; that is, by property
owners' association, public park, or other legal entity; and, in such case where more than
one property owners' association is being created, documentation shall be clearly
submitted as to which areas will have automatic membership into said associations.
This requirement shall not be interpreted as requiring a detailed site development plan
which includes the exact boundaries and locations of all structures proposed for
construction.
(3) All setback lines for all properties shall be shown.
(4) If the project is to be developed in more than one phase, the boundaries of each
proposed phase shall be clearly indicated on the development plan.
(5) Calculations shall be submitted of the total number of gross acres in the project, and the
acres and percentages thereof proposed to be devoted to the several dwelling types,
commercial or other non-residential uses, as well as streets, parks, schools, and other
reservations.
(6) Tabulation of the total number of dwelling units by various types in the project or if the
project is to be developed in phases, by each phase within the project.
The Preliminary Development Plan will be reviewed by Staff and their recommendation shall
be forwarded to the Planning Commission. A public hearing for the Preliminary Plat and
Development Plan shall be set not later than the second regular meeting after filing, and shall
be legally advertised as specified in the Zoning Ordinance.
At the public hearing before the Planning Commission, the applicant and interested citizens
will have the opportunity to discuss the merits of the Planned Unit Development proposal.
The Planning Commission will assess the proposal in light of ordinance guidelines and will
take action after weighing the recommendations of the Staff, the applicant's presentation, and
the community's response. The Commission shall approve, recommend approval conditioned
on specified modifications, or recommend disapproval of the Planned Unit Development
proposal.
After the Preliminary Development Plan is reviewed by the Planning Commission, it will be
forwarded to the City Council for their action. The City Council may grant, deny, defer for
requested changes or information, or return the application to the Planning Commission for
further study. The Council may direct the Planning Commission to reconsider specific aspects
of the Preliminary Development Plan.
14
22:420 (PUD)
If the City Council approves the Preliminary Development Plan, it shall be in the form of an
Ordinance which shall specify all conditions and schedules necessary to insure that the
proposed Planned Unit Development is accomplished. The applicant is permitted to construct
the Planned Unit Development in more than one phase or stage of construction. In such cases,
the applicant shall clearly indicate on the site plan map the boundaries of each proposed phase.
If the sequence of construction of various portions of the development is to occur in phases or
stages, then the open space and/or recreational facilities should be developed or committed
thereto in proportion to the number of dwelling units intended to be developed during any
given stage of construction. Additionally, the applicant shall submit a schedule of
construction for the project or for each phase within the project indicating the sequence of
development according to residential type and other non-residential construction within the
project.
(c) Final Plat/Development Plan. The applicant shall have three (3) years from the date of the
City Council approval to submit the Final Development Plan/Plat. In cases where a phased
Preliminary Development Plan is approved, an approved submission schedule for incremental
Final Development Plan/Plat shall be followed. Requests for extensions of time shall be
submitted in writing to the City Council which may grant one (1) extension of not less than
one (1) year nor more than three (3) years. Requests for time extensions must be made within
three years of the date of the City Council approval. Failure to submit a Final Development
Plan, or ask for an extension, shall be sufficient cause for the City Council to revoke the
Ordinance and the approved Preliminary Development Plan. The Planning Commission shall
review the Final Development Plan/Final Plat to determine that no substantial changes were
made to those elements of the plan agreed upon in the Preliminary Development Plan. If
substantial changes are found to have been made to the agreed elements, then the application
must be resubmitted for Preliminary Development Plan review.
The Final Development Plan/Plat shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the
Preliminary Development Plan provided that the Plan/Plat does not:
(1) Increase proposed floor area for non-residential use by more than five percent (5%);
(2) Increase total building coverage by more than five percent (5%);
(3) Increase building height by more than five percent (5%);
(4) Increase total number of dwelling units by more than five percent (5%) within a given
phase. Fluctuation greater than the above shall be permissible, provided overall density
is maintained.
(5) Substantially change the location of any non-residential areas as shown on the approved
Preliminary Plan; and
(6) Significantly modify the location or design of minor streets, cul-de-sacs, alleys, or
facilities for water, storm water, and sanitary sewer.
(7) Significantly change the phasing plan or the development schedule.
All other changes in the Planned Unit Development including changes in the list of permissible
uses must be made under the procedures that are applicable to the initial approval of a Planned
Unit Development project. The burden shall be upon the landowner to demonstrate good
cause for any variation between the preliminary plan previously approved and the final
plan/plat submitted for approval.
The Final Development Plan and Final Plat shall be reviewed by Staff and their
recommendation shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission not later than the second
regular meeting after filing. If the Planning Commission finds that only minor differences
exist in the final development plan/plat, then it shall be forwarded to the City Council for their
approval.
15
22:420 (PUD)

altered by the developer or the property owners association without the specific approval
of the City.
6. Revocation.
(a) Causes for revocation. The Planning Commission shall recommend to the City Council that
any previous Planned Unit Development approval be revoked and all building permits be
voided under the following circumstances:
(1) If the applicant has not submitted a Final Development Plan to the City of Norman

SEC. 420.05 - SIMPLE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
(Ord. No. O-1718-14  December 28, 2017; O-1718-47  July 26, 2018; O-1718-51  August 23, 2018)
1. General Description. The Simple Planned Unit Development referred to as SPUD, is a special zoning
district that provides an alternate approach to the conventional land use controls and to a PUD, Planned
Unit Development to maximize the unique physical features of a particular site and produce unique,
creative, progressive, or quality land developments.
The SPUD may be used for particular tracts or parcels of land that are to be developed, according to a
SPUD Narrative and a Development Plan Map and contains less than five (5) acres.
The SPUD is subject to review procedures by Planning Commission and adoption by City Council.
2. Statement of Purpose. It is the intent of this section to encourage developments with a superior built
environment brought about through unified development and to provide for the application of design
ingenuity in such developments while protecting existing and future surrounding areas in achieving the
goals of comprehensive plan of record. In addition the SPUD provides for the following:
Encourage efficient, innovative use of land in the placement and/or clustering of buildings in a
development and protect the health, safety and welfare of the community.
Contribute to the revitalization and/or redevelopment of areas where decline of any type has occurred.
Promote infill development that is compatible and harmonious with adjacent uses and would otherwise not
be an area that could physically be redeveloped under conventional zoning.
Maintain consistency with the Citys Zoning Ordinance, and other applicable plans, policies, standards and
regulations on record.
Approval of a zone change to a SPUD adopts the Master Plan prepared by the applicant and reviewed as a
part of the application. The SPUD establishes new and specific requirements for the amount and type of
land use, residential densities, if appropriate, development regulations and location of specific elements of
the development, such as open space and screening.
3. Uses Permitted. In addition to zoning districts established elsewhere in this chapter, a Simple Planned
Unit Development zoning district is established and shall be designated on the Zoning District Map, upon
application of the landowner and approval by the City Council. There are no specifically prescribed uses
which are permitted within the boundaries of a Simple Planned Unit Development. The developer shall be
responsible for preparation of a list of permitted uses within the specific Simple Planned Unit Development
requested.
4. Master Plan.
(a) The basis for review and approval of a SPUD application shall be the SPUD Narrative and
SPUD Development Plan Map, which shall be adopted as a part of the ordinance for
rezoning in conformance with the requirements described in the regulations.
(b) The SPUD Master Plan shall consist of two (2) elements:
SPUD Narrative, and
The Site Development Plan Map
19
420.05 (SPUD)
The SPUD Narrative and Development Plan Map establishes residential densities, if
appropriate, as well as the amount, type and general location of all land uses; the SPUD
Narrative and Development Plan Map shall serve at the basis for review and approval of
all subdivision plats and building permits within the SPUD.
5. Criteria for Review and Approval. The applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and services
that may not be required or possible under the current conventional zoning. Review and approval of a
SPUD is therefore a process of negotiation between the city government and the applicant to achieve the
intent and purpose of the regulations of the comprehensive plan of record while maintaining/establishing
compatible uses abutting one another.
The following factors should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a SPUD
application. Other factors not listed herein may also be considered in the review process in order to
respond to specific design and land use proposals.
(a) The proposed SPUD shall be designed to provide for the unified development of the area
in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the adopted comprehensive plan of record and
the land uses and zoning districts adjacent to said proposal.
(b) Density, land use, and intensity will be based on the SPUD Narrative and Development
Plan Map and be in conformance with the comprehensive plan of record.
(c) Location and type of housing shall be established in a general pattern and shown on the
Development Plan Map and outlined in the Narrative as supporting documentation.
(d) Minimum design and construction standards for streets and alleys shall meet the
requirements adopted in the Subdivision Regulations or other policies on record.
6. Standards of Development.
(a) The Site Development Plan shall include the following: north arrow, all property lines, all
adjacent street and alley rights-of-way, show the centerline of each and any street names,
the location of driveway approaches both on-site and across the street.
(1) Identify the uses to be allowed in the district
(2) Maximum height of all buildings
(3) Maximum number of buildings
(4) Designating on the Development Plan the front, side and rear of the lot(s), with
setbacks (if any)
(5) Description of the sight-proof screening requirements
(6) Description of all outdoor/exterior lighting to be regulated on site
(7) Master sign plan for the site is required
(8) The applicant must show how drainage/storm water management methods will be
addressed so as to not impact adjacent property owners
20
420.05 (SPUD)
(9) A description of the architecture of all buildings including exterior building
materials
(10) A statement indicating the percentage of open space for the site
(11) A detail of the parking area must be shown on the Site Development Plan
(b) Within the Central Core Area of Norman (see map exhibit to Sec. 431.7), any two-family
(duplex) structure with four or more bedrooms per unit is required to be sprinkled per the
requirement in Section P2904 of the International Residential Code (IRC) or NFPA 13D,
or as these documents are amended. (O-1718-47)
(c) A theater, including one that sells alcoholic beverages in compliance with state
law, may be incorporated into appropriate Simple Planned Unit Developments.
(O-1718-51)
7. General Design and Development Guidelines.
(a) Amenities. Amenities should be considered as an important justification for development
and city approval of a SPUD. The applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and
services that may not be required or possible in a conventional development such as
additional landscaping, usable open space fencing, limiting curb cuts, limits of no access,
sidewalks and pedestrian ways where it is necessary to provide for public safety, minimal
signage to provide development compatible with adjacent developments and
neighborhoods.
(b) Land Area. The land area allowed under a SPUD is less than five (5) acres in size.
(c) Off-Street Parking, Loading and Access. All uses should contain adequate parking on
private property to provide parking, loading and maneuvering of vehicles in accordance
with the regulations established in Section 431.5  Off-Street Parking Requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance. The applicant may request a parking variance within the SPUD
Narrative.
(d) Relationship to Abutting Uses. The Master Development Plan Map should show
graphically the treatment, what will be employed to separate the SPUD uses from abutting
properties, including commitments to landscaping, screening, earthen berms or similar
techniques.
It is appropriate to specifically establish areas with height limitations where a transition to
more intense uses is proposed or where a higher intensity development is proposed to abut
a lower intensive area.
The applicant may request a variance to the landscaping requirements established in
Section 431.8  Landscaping Requirements for Off-Street Parking Facilities within the
SPUD Narrative.
(e) Common Access. In office, commercial or industrial developments, the SPUD
Development Plan should establish specific standards and locations for common access
driveways both within the development and abutting arterial streets.
8. Application Procedures. The application procedures for the SPUD shall follow the procedures listed in
Section 420(4) of this Ordinance.
21
420.05 (SPUD)

Ordinance.
11. Administration. The Planning Director shall be permitted to approve minor amendments and
adjustments to the SPUD Narrative or Site Development Plan Map, provided the following conditions
are satisfied:
(a) The project boundaries are not altered.
(b) Uses other than those specifically approved in the SPUD are not added. Percentage of
area devoted to specific uses may not be increased or decreased by more than 20
percent of the area devoted to the specific use. Uses may be deleted, but not to the
extent that the character of the project is substantially altered.
(c) The allocation of land to particular uses, or the relationship of uses within the project,
is not substantially altered.
(d) The density of housing is not increased by more than 20 percent or decreased by more
than 20 percent.
(e) The land area allocated to non-residential uses is not increased or decreased by more
than 20 percent.

surrounded by landscaped yards. Particular attention should be given to integrating uses and the design of
buildings on the periphery of the district with uses in adjacent districts. Enterprises operating in this
district may require direct access to rail, air, or street transportation facilities; however, the size and volume
of raw materials, partially processed or finished products involved with each industrial activity should not

(a) Open space is an important organizing element within a mixed use development, and must be
integrated into the overall design of the project. Open space, both public and private, shall be
distributed throughout the development and should provide not only aesthetic quality, but
serve recreational and civic functions as well. A variety of types of open spaces should always
be conveniently accessible to all residents and provide physical linkages throughout the
neighborhood. It should also provide gathering places for residents and places for social
interaction. In a neighborhood area with small lots or higher density buildings, public open
spaces are critical components, and must be coordinated with the overall pedestrian system of
sidewalks and pathways.
(1) Various types of open space may be provided, but must include a central open space such
as a park, square, or plaza.
(2) Additional open spaces may include active recreation facilities as well as passive open
spaces such as greenways, creeks, detention ponds, drainage areas, or other similar types
of open space.
(3) No portion of any building lot or road right-of-way area may be used for meeting the
minimum required amount of total open space.
(4) The dedication of public park land shall be regulated in accordance with Article VII of
Chapter 19, and is based on the expected residential population of the proposed
development.
(b) Total Open Space: The following quantities of open space shall be provided in all
developments:
Type of Open Space Minimum Amount to be Provided
Total Open Space 20% of gross tract area; total open space includes the
central open space and drainage areas.
Central Open Space 7% of gross tract area.
(c) Central Open Space Requirements:
(1) Central Open Space Design Options. The central open space, typically a neighborhood
park, square, or plaza, shall meet one of the following design options:
(a) Configured so that a circle with a radius of fifty feet (50) can fit within the confines
of the open space, or
(b) Be surrounded along at least forty-five percent (45%) of its perimeter by roads with
sidewalks. When an open space is directly fronted on at least two sides by nonresidential
or multi-family buildings with public doors facing the open space, the
City Council may allow the percentage of street frontage to be reduced to twenty
percent (20%) of the open space perimeter.
(2) Additional Central Open Space/Park Guidelines:
(a) Detention basins and other storm water impounding areas, except for permanent wet
ponds, may not be counted toward satisfying the central open space area
requirement.
(b) The central open space shall be located near the middle of the development and shall
be easily and conveniently accessible by sidewalk or paved trail from all dwelling
units and non-residential buildings in the development. Ninety percent (90%) of the
lots within the development shall be located within a quarter mile of the central open
space.
85
22:429 (MUD)
(c) In order to facilitate public interaction, the central open space shall be improved with
a focal point such as a gazebo, public art or sculpture, pavilion, or paved patio area
with a fountain to help identify the park as a primary gathering place for the
development. The area of this focal point shall be a minimum of 300 square feet in
size.
(d) The central open space in the development should be accessible by pedestrians,
bicycles, and vehicles. Sidewalks shall be provided adjacent to all roadways and
shall be a minimum of six feet (6) wide and not be adjacent to the curb.
(e) Display of public art in plaza areas is encouraged.
(f) The central open space is a key component of a mixed use development. It and all
other common elements should be owned and maintained by a mandatory Property
Owners Association.
11. Landscape and Buffer Requirements for Mixed Use Developments.
(a) Within all mixed use developments, trees shall be planted along all streets, but are not required
adjacent to public and private alleys.
(1) In front of residential buildings, street trees shall be located within a planting strip a
minimum of six feet (6) wide within the street right-of-way.
(2) In front of non-residential or mixed use buildings, street trees may be planted in tree wells
installed within the ten foot (10) (or wider) sidewalk. Tree wells shall be a minimum of
four feet by four feet wide by three and a half feet deep (4x4x3.5). Larger wells are
recommended, and could be connected together as a continuous planting pit to facilitate
an underground watering system. Tree wells shall be covered by tree grates, concrete unit
pavers, or cobbles.
(3) Within any central open space, street trees are required adjacent to the perimeter sidewalk
which surrounds the open space.
(4) Trees shall generally be spaced fifty feet (50) on center, but may vary to minimize
conflicts with utilities such as street lights.
(b) A buffer between mixed use developments and any surrounding residential developments shall
be established by a minimum ten foot (10) landscape area. The buffer shall be landscaped
with a mixture of trees, shrubs, flowers or grasses, and include a six foot (6) masonry wall

 May 23, 2017; O-1617-38  June 26, 2017)
1. Description and Purpose. The Flood Hazard District includes special flood hazard areas which are
subject to periodic or occasional flooding during a one percent chance flood, and for which special
regulations are applied in addition to or in combination with other zoning regulations applying to these
areas to guide the type and manner of floodplain use so that it is consistent with the land use needs of the
City of Norman.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas;
(7) Control in special flood hazard areas, uses such as fill dumping, storage of materials,
structures, buildings and any other works which, acting alone or in combination with other
existing or future uses, would cause damaging flood heights or erosive velocities by
obstructing flows and reducing floodplain storage;
(8) Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood-prone area;
(9) Meet the needs of the streams to carry flood waters and protect the creek channels and
floodplains from encroachment so that flood heights and flood damage will not be
increased;
(10) Enhance existing protections for residents, structures, and public facilities from flood
damage;
(11) Preserve floodplain areas for their open space and natural habitat values; and,
(12) Establish provisions and procedures that will provide additional protections for floodplain
areas with no net loss of allowable density on affected lots and parcels.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood,
or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood
damage;
87
22:429.1 (FH)
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood
waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(6) Require the transfer of structures and buildings from portions of the lot in the floodplain to
upland areas out of the floodplain;
(7) Seek ways to reduce loss of natural floodplain areas and enhance natural and beneficial
functions of floodplains in areas facing development.
To secure this protection from flooding, the objectives of this section are to assure the retention of
sufficient floodway area to convey flood flows; to designate a minimum flood protection elevation; to
reduce the height and violence of floods insofar as such are increased by any artificial obstruction; and to
assure the proper floodproofing of structures subject to flooding. The purpose of the Flood Hazard District
is to provide that designated special flood hazard areas are developed only in the interest of the
community's general health, safety, and welfare. The Flood Hazard District is not for the purpose of
encouraging development in areas of special flood hazard.
To further the interest of the community's general health, safety and welfare, any violation of this section
shall be deemed to constitute a public nuisance.
This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction
conflict or overlap, whichever imposed the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

Map Change adopted by City Council, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. The
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) for the Ten Mile Flat Creek Area dated
December, 2005, shall also be considered a part of the Special Flood Hazard Area until
such time it is adopted by FEMA. This "Flood Insurance Study" with its accompanying
FIRM, also known as the Official Flood Hazard District Maps, are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be part of this ordinance and may be amended or revised from
time to time by the City Council according to procedures established by FEMA.
Amendments that have been adopted by Council include the following: FEMA Case No.
16-06-2604P, approved by FEMA effective May 31, 2017. The Official Flood Hazard
District Maps shall be placed on file with the City Clerk and copies shall be maintained in

regulations of the underlying district. Whenever a conflict in requirements results, the most
stringent requirements shall apply.
(c) Amendments to the District Boundaries [Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)]: The
boundaries of the Flood Hazard District may be amended from time to time when more
current or precise technical flood hazard information becomes available and approved by
FEMA.
Based upon the technical analysis approved by FEMA the City Council shall formally
amend the zoning district boundaries consistent with a letter of map revision from FEMA.
(O-1617-34)
(d) The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On are
occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by
man-made or material causes.
This ordinance does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance
shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof
for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.

(including fuel storage tanks) in the floodplain will either have to be
elevated to or above the BFE or floodproofed (made watertight) to that
elevation. Any electrical and mechanical equipment must be elevated or
floodproofed to the BFE. Any storage tanks and any equipment at the site
that could be damaged by floodwaters will have to be elevated above the
BFE or made watertight and anchored to resist floatation, collapse and
lateral movement. A registered engineer will have to certify the design of
the floodproofing measures. As this is non-residential construction, the
drill site and road to the well does not need to be elevated. The drilling
operation shall comply with all other local, state and federal requirements
prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit. All new or
replacement flowlines, pipelines, etc., that will cross rivers, streams,
creeks, and channels, shall be bored to be below the bed. The depth below
the bed shall be a minimum of 10 feet. The pipe used for the crossing
shall be 1 pipe grade higher, or have a wall thickness twice the thickness
of the standard pipe used for the flowline, pipeline, etc. If the flowline,
pipeline, etc. becomes exposed, the crossing must be rebored. The ground
surface shall not be disturbed within 50 feet of the river, stream, creek, or
channel banks. (O-0809-3)

22:429.1 (FH)
(e) Prohibited Uses
(1) Manufactured Home Parks shall not be constructed in any areas of the Flood
Hazard District;
(2) Any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,
and other development, within any floodway of the designated Flood Hazard
District that would result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of
the 1 percent chance flood are prohibited. (O-0809-3)
(f) Standards for Subdivision Proposals:
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with Section 4(b) of this ordinance;
(O-1617-34)
(2) All proposals for the development of subdivisions shall meet all applicable
permitting requirements of this ordinance; (O-1617-34)
(3) Base flood elevation data shall be generated for any subdivision proposals and
other proposed land development activity, if not otherwise provided pursuant to
Sections 3 and 4 of this ordinance; (O-1617-34)
(4) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards; (O-1617-34)
(5) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration or flood damage; (O-1617-34)
(6) Whenever possible, a proposed subdivision which contains some land within the
floodplain shall be developed using the Planned Unit Development process, so that
dwelling units could be located out of the floodplain and such areas left
undeveloped or without residential structures.
(g) Floodways -- Located within special flood hazard areas established in Section 3(a) are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential,
encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements
and other development unless certification by a professional registered engineer is
provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(h) Special Floodplain and Building Construction Regulations Applicable to Little River and
Its Mapped Tributaries. (O-0809-3)
(1) Applicability -- The provisions of this Section 429.1.4(h) shall apply to all
construction on all properties located within the floodplain of the Little River and
its tributaries within the boundaries of the City of Norman as depicted on FEMA

(9/26/08), and shall supersede any conflicting regulations contained in Section
429.1 -- FH, Flood Hazard District. The Conditional Letter of Map Revision
(CLOMR) for the Ten Mile Flat Creek Area dated December, 2005, shall also be
considered a part of the Special Flood Hazard Area north of Rock Creek Road
until such time it is adopted by FEMA. (O-1213-25)
101
22:429.1 (FH)
(2) Building Construction Within Floodplain Prohibited -- No building construction
shall be allowed within the floodplain of the Little River and its tributaries except
as provided in this Section 429.1.4(h). (O-0809-3)
(3) Parcels And Lots Located Partially Within The Floodplain-Transfer Of Permitted
Development Density -- Any development resulting in the construction of
buildings or other structures on a parcel partially located in the floodplain, shall
be located wholly in upland areas of the parcel outside the floodplain. This
procedure will not result in a change to the density permitted in underlying zoning
district. Examples A and B of this procedure are located in the appendix at the end
of Section 429.1.
(4) Reduction In Minimum Lot Size -- To accommodate transfers of permissible
residential density as provided above, the minimum lot size in land zoned A-2,
Rural Agricultural District, subject to this Section 429.1.4(h) may be reduced from
ten acres to a minimum of two acres. The process that allows this transfer is
through the Norman Rural Certificate of Survey to ensure that proper restrictions
are put in place at the time of development.
(5) Lot Configuration and Building Envelopes  To the maximum extent feasible, lots
subject to this Section 429.1.4(h) shall be configured so that they lie entirely out
of the floodplain with any remainder parcel being preserved as provided in Section
429.1.4(h)(7) below. As an alternative, lots may be configured so that portions are
located within the floodplain. However, building envelopes of such lots shall be
delineated to lie to the maximum extent feasible outside the flood-plain. All
building permits with building envelopes partially within the flood-plain shall be
subject to approval of the Floodplain Permit Committee in keeping with the
purpose of this Section 429.1.4(h). If no other option for access is practicable,
driveways may be located within the floodplain.
(6) Exception for Parcels and Lots Located Entirely Within The Floodplain And/Or
Lacking Sufficient Upland Building Area - For any legal parcel or lot existing as
of the date of this amendment (November 16, 2004) that is located entirely within
the floodplain and/or lacks sufficient upland building area to transfer allowable
density as required by this Section, development may be allowed in the floodplain
subject to the following requirements:
(a) Residential structures shall be constructed on fill so that the lowest floor
(including the basement) is at least two (2) feet above the base flood
elevation. The fill shall be at a level no lower than one (1) foot above the
base flood elevation for the particular area and shall extend at such
elevation at least fifteen (15) feet, beyond the limits of any structure or
building erected thereon;
(b) The area required for any building envelope for permissible principal and
accessory buildings and on-site waste disposal systems shall be minimized
to the maximum extent feasible and shall be located as far as possible
from the Little River or tributary channel and environmentally sensitive
areas on the lot. All building envelopes and the location and extent of onsite
waste disposal systems shall be subject to approval of the Floodplain
Permit Committee in keeping with the purposes of this Section 429.1.4(h).
102
22:429.1 (FH)
(7) Floodplain Land Conservation -- Any portion of a parcel or lot located in a
floodplain and not part of an approved building envelope shall be permanently
protected from development as private or public open space through a mechanism
acceptable to and approved by the City of Norman. Such mechanism may include,
but is not limited to a conservation easement, permanent deed restriction, or
transfer to a non-profit conservation organization or government entity.
5. Floodplain Permit Administration.
The Director of Public Works is hereby appointed the Floodplain Administrator to administer and
implement the provisions of this ordinance and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National Flood
Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management. Floodplain Permits are required for
uses which must receive special attention to prevent obstruction of floodways, threats to other lands from
floating debris, and substantial damage to the uses themselves.
Uses listed above requiring a Floodplain Permit may be allowed only upon issuance of a special permit by
a super majority vote of five (5) or more of the Floodplain Permit Committee composed of the Director of
Planning and Community Development, the Director of Public Works, City Engineer, the Development
Coordinator, the Manager of the Current Planning Division and two citizens appointed by the Mayor with
advice and consent of the Council. The citizen members of the Floodplain Permit Committee shall serve
staggered three (3) year terms. All members shall have successfully completed the basic floodplain
training offered by the Oklahoma Water Resource Board or equivalent training or education, and at least
one member shall be a Certified Floodplain Manager. The floodplain Permit Committee shall meet on an
as-needed basis the first and third Monday of each month and shall post public notice accordingly.
Floodplain Permit application forms shall be furnished by the Department of Public Works. Upon
receiving an application for the special permit involving the use of fill, construction of structures, or
storage of materials, the Committee shall, prior to rendering a decision thereon, obtain and study essential
information and request technical advice as appropriate. Such information and technical advice becomes a
part of the application and is retained with the application. (O-8081-25; O-0203-52; O-0607-55).
(a) The Committee may require the applicant to furnish any or all of the following information
as it deems necessary for determining the suitability of the particular site for the proposed
use, and the information becomes a part of the application and is retained with the
application:

above to the location of the channel, floodway, and the flood-protection
elevation.
(ii) A typical cross-section or more if required by the Floodplain Permit
Committee showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas
adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be occupied by
the proposed development, and high-water information.
103
22:429.1 (FH)
(iii) Plans (plan view) showing elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent
structure, fill, or storage elevations; size, location, and spatial arrangement
of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and elevations
of streets, water supply, sanitary facilities; photographs showing existing
land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream, soil types, and other
pertinent information.

will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
(vii) A certified list of names and addresses of all record property owners
within a three hundred fifty (350) foot radius of the exterior boundary of
the subject property not to exceed 100 feet laterally from the Special
Flood Hazard Area. The radius to be extended by increments of one
hundred (100) linear feet until the list of property owners includes not less
than fifteen (15) individual property owners of separate parcels or until a
maximum radius of one thousand (1,000) feet has been reached. A
certified list of names and addresses of all record property owners within a
three hundred fifty (350) foot radius of the exterior boundary of the
subject property not to exceed 100 feet laterally from the Special Flood
Hazard Area. The radius to be extended by increments of one hundred
(100) linear feet until the list of property owners includes not less than
fifteen (15) individual property owners of separate parcels or until a
maximum radius of one thousand (1,000) feet has been reached. Public
notification shall be provided in writing prior to the date of the Floodplain
Permit Committee meeting to review the application and shall include the
date, time and place of the meeting.
(viii) For proposed development within any flood hazard area (except for those
areas designated as regulatory floodways), certification that a rise of no
more than five hundredths of a foot (0.05) will occur on any adjacent
property in the base flood elevation as a result of the proposed work. For
proposed development within a designated regulatory floodway,
certification of no increase in flood levels within the community during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge as a result of the proposed
work. All certifications shall be signed and sealed by a Registered
Professional Engineer licensed to practice in the State of Oklahoma.
(2) The following information may be required by the Floodplain Permit Committee if
the committee believes that the information will improve the quality of the
decision for the application.
(i) Specifications for building construction and materials, floodproofing,
filling, dredging, grading, channel improvement, storage of materials,
water supply, and sanitary facilities.
(ii) Such other pertinent information as may be required to analyze the
specific situation.
104
22:429.1 (FH)
(iii) Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential
structure shall be floodproofed.
(iv) A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the
nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria
of this ordinance.
(b) The Floodplain Permit Committee may transmit one copy of the information described in
subsection (1) to a designated independent engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance, where necessary, in evaluating the proposed project in relation to
flood heights and velocities, the seriousness of flood damage to the use; the adequacy of
the plans for protection; and other technical matters, with any attendant costs to be
assumed by the applicant. Based upon review of the technical information available, the
Committee shall determine the specific flood hazard at the site, evaluate the suitability of
the proposed use in relation to the flood hazard, and issue the requested Floodplain Permit
or advise the applicant that his request was not approved. The Floodplain Permit
Committee shall also be responsible for the following:
(1) Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the
special flood hazard areas (for example, where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the Floodplain Permit
Committee shall make the necessary interpretation.
(2) The Floodplain Permit Committee shall assure that the flood carrying capacity
within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
(3) In A Zones, in the absence of FEMA BFE data and floodway data, the Floodplain
Permit Committee shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize other BFE and
floodway data as a basis for elevating residential structures above the base flood
level, and for flood-proofing or elevating non-residential structures above the base
flood level.
(4) Where BFE data are utilized in Zone A, obtain and maintain records of the lowest
floor and floodproofing elevations for new and substantially improved
construction.
(5) When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain Permit
Committee shall not permit any new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development (including fill) within Zones A, A1-30 and AE on the
community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood more than five hundredths of a foot (0.05) on any adjacent
property.
(c) Approval or Denial of a Floodplain Permit request, as required by Subsection 5(a) and (b)
above, by the Floodplain Permit Committee shall be based on all of the provisions of this
ordinance and the following relevant factors:
(1) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(2) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the
effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(3) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
105
22:429.1 (FH)
(4) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(5) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
(6) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions
including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
(7) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
(8) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
(9) The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage,
for the proposed use;
(10) The relationship of the proposed use to the City of Normans adopted LAND USE
PLAN for that area.
(d) Conditions Attached to Floodplain Permits: Upon consideration of the factors of the
specific Floodplain Permit use and the purposes of this ordinance, the Floodplain Permit
Committee may attach such conditions to the granting of such permits as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance. Among such conditions without
limitation because of specific enumeration may be included:
(1) Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
(2) Limitations on periods of use and operation.
(3) Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
(4) Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees, and other
protective measures.
(5) Floodproofing measures such as the following shall be designed consistent with
the flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, durations,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the base flood. The following floodproofing measures, among others, may be
required:
(i) Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement;
(ii) Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, and shutters, or similar
methods of construction;
(iii) Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures;
(iv) Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of water through
walls;
(v) Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation;
(vi) Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures;
(vii) Construction of water supply and waste-treatment systems so as to prevent
the entrance of flood waters;
(viii) Installation of pumping facilities or comparable practices for subsurface
drainage systems for buildings to relieve external foundation wall and
basement flood pressures;
(ix) Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or
floating debris;
106
22:429.1 (FH)
(x) Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm drains which will
permit the drains to be closed to prevent back-up of sewage and storm
waters into the buildings or structures. Gravity draining of basements may
be eliminated by mechanical devices;
(xi) Location of all electrical equipment, circuits, and installed electrical
appliances in a manner which will assure they are not subject to flooding
and to provide protection from inundation by the regulatory flood;
(xii) Location of any structural storage facilities for chemicals, explosives,
buoyant materials, flammable liquids, or other toxic materials which could
be hazardous to public health, safety, and welfare in a manner which will
assure that the facilities are situated at elevations above the height
associated with the base flood elevation or are adequately floodproofed to
prevent flotation of storage containers, or damage to storage containers
which could result in the escape of toxic materials into flood waters.
(6) Requirements for reclamation actions following extraction operations.
(7) All floodplain permits shall expire two years after approval by the Floodplain
Permit Committee. (O-0203-52)
(e) Appeals from any decision of the Floodplain Permit Committee may be taken by any
person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the Committee, to the
Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall consider the appeal at a regular or
special meeting as soon as practicable and make its decision on the suitability of the
proposed use in relation to the flood hazard. Any person or persons aggrieved by the
decision of the Board of Adjustment may appeal such decision to a court of competent
jurisdiction. At least two members of the Board of Adjustment shall have successfully
completed the (8) eight hour basic floodplain training offered by the Oklahoma Water
Resource Board or equivalent training or education.
(f) Variances: After proper application, a Variance may be granted by the Board of
Adjustment:
(1) New construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half
acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood elevation, providing the relevant factors in
Subsection (c) above of this Ordinance have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing
the Variance increases.
(2) Reconstruction, rehabilitation, repair, or restoration of historic structuresupon the
determination that the proposed work shall not preclude the structures continued
designation as a historic structure and the exception is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
107
22:429.1 (FH)
(4) Prerequisites for granting variances:
(a) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) Showing a good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(c) Any applicant that is issued a variance shall be given written notice that
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation.
(g) Implementation: The Director of Public Works will administer and implement the
provisions of this article and will:
(1) Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this ordinance, and shall report any actions involving appeals,
Floodplain Permit Committee decisions, or other activities covered by this
ordinance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(2) Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits
have been obtained from those Federal, State or Local governmental agencies
from which prior approval is required.
(3) Cause all construction activity permitted under the provisions of this code to be
inspected for compliance with the provisions of this code and the design as
approved.
(4) Notify adjacent property owners and the Oklahoma Water Resources Board prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to FEMA.
108
22:429.1 (FH)
(h) Special Floodplain and Development Regulations Applicable to Little River and Its
Mapped Tributaries.
(1) Parcels and Lots Located Partially Within The Floodplain-Transfer of Permitted
Development Density.
Example A: Smith owns a ten-acre lot adjacent to the Little River. The
underlying A-2, Rural Agricultural zoning allows 1 unit/10 acres. Seven
acres of the parcel lie in the floodplain, and 3 acres on an upland portion
outside the mapped floodplain. Smith would still be allowed to build on
the lot, but it would have to be sited on the 3 acres outside the floodplain.
Any septic system would also be located outside the floodplain to the
maximum extent feasible.
Example B: Farmer Brown owns a 40-acre parcel that could be divided
into four ten-acre building sites under the applicable A-2 zoning. 30
acres of the parcel are located in the floodplain, and 10 acres are
outside. To subdivide the parcel, Brown would be required to cluster the
building site (to a maximum of 4 lots) on the 10 acres outside the
floodplain. Each of the lots could be reduced in size to 2 acres as
provided below. As an alternative, up to four ten-acre lots could be
created, all having some portion in the floodplain. However, Brown
would work with staff to identify building envelopes located outside the
floodplain within each lot.
6. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full
compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
7. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be; (1)
considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and (3)
deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
8. Boundary Interpretation. Where the district boundaries are indicated by elevation; the elevation at a
particular point shall be determined and that point shall be the district boundary. The exact boundary of
the floodplain shall be determined by elevation.
9. Enforcement of Violations. The Planning and Community Development Department is authorized to
issue citations as set forth below:
(a) Each day during which a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
(b) For each offense cited, a penalty of not less than $50.00 nor more than $750.00 shall be
assessed to
(1) the owner(s) of record and/or
(2) any person employed in connection therewith and who may have assisted in the
commission of such violation.
109
22:429.1 (FH)
In addition to the penalties provided in Section 1-18 of the Municipal Code, the City may institute
appropriate actions or proceedings at law or equity for the enforcement of the provisions of this article or to
correct the violations thereof. The conviction and punishment of any person hereunder shall not relieve
such person from the responsibility to correct prohibited buildings, structures, obstructions, or
improvements, nor prevent the enforcement, correction, or removal thereof.
The legally recorded owner of any property located in a special flood hazard area onto which fill material
of any nature has been applied, with or without his knowledge and in violation of the provisions of this
article, shall immediately and at his expense remove all such material upon written request to do so by
the Director of Public Works. Upon failure of the property owner to complete this work in a timely
manner, the City Council may order the work to be completed and expenses charged to the property owner
or levied against the property.
Any and all apprehended persons depositing fill material of any nature in violation of this Article shall be
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
10. Restriction of Wastewater Treatment Facility Service Area.
(a) There shall be no new development permitted within the special flood hazard, as defined
on the latest publication of the National Flood Insurance Programs Flood Insurance Rate
Map, which would generate wastewater to be transported to the City of Norman
Wastewater Treatment Facilities. This restriction does not apply to any development,
which in the opinion of the Floodplain Permit Committee by its nature must be located on
or adjacent to water.
(b) A Waiver of Service Area Restrictions may be considered by the Floodplain Permit
Committee upon written request by the applicant. Upon review of the request to waive the
service area restriction, the Floodplain Permit Committee may submit, if it concurs with
the waiver request, a formal application for a waiver to the Regional EPA Administrator.
The Regional Administrator, after considering the Floodplain Permit Committees
application and all other relevant information on a proposed developments effects on the
natural functions and values of the affected floodplain, may waive the service area
restriction in individual cases.
11. Emergency Authority. The Floodplain Administrator shall have the emergency authority during times
of flooding to approve any temporary measure that he or she, in his or her sole professional judgment,
determines is necessary to protect life, property and/or the community from the eminent threat of any
associated flood hazards. Upon cessation of the flooding event and at the earliest possible time, any
approved temporary measure meeting the definition of the floodplain development and subject to this
ordinance shall be removed or shall be subject to review by the Floodplain Permit Committee under the
requirement of this ordinance for approval or disapproval as a permanent floodplain development. (O-

determines that a Certificate of Appropriateness should not be issued, a
new application may be submitted on the proposed construction,
rehabilitation, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving, only if
substantive change is made to the original plans for the proposed work. In
such a case, applicants will be required to submit a new application with
all supporting documentation, including the payment of another $75
application fee and a certified list of adjacent property owners.
Reapplication fees may be waived when the Commission denies a request
for COA due to incomplete application information.
[i] Amending a COA. A request to amend a Certificate of Appropriateness
currently in effect does not require a new application, though proposed
amendments shall be reviewed by the Historic District Commission at a
regularly scheduled meeting.
[j] Time Limits of Certificate of Appropriateness: A Certificate of
Appropriateness issued by the Historic District Commission shall become
null and void if construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration,
moving or demolition is not commenced within six (6) months of the date
of issuance. An extension of time for the Certificate of Appropriateness,
not to exceed six (6) months, may be granted by the Historic District
Commission upon review, provided application for such extension is
submitted in writing prior to expiration of the Certificate of
Appropriateness.
3. Review Criteria. The Historic District Commission shall have responsibility for
reviewing requests for Building and Demolition permits for designated historic
structures within any area designated as a historic district, and for issuing or
denying Certificates of Appropriateness for such requests. The purpose of this
Section to specify for Historic District Commission members policies and criteria
that they shall follow in reaching decisions on matters relative to such changes.
Review criteria, procedural policies and consequences of decisions will extend
beyond the tenure of any Historic District Commission members. It is essential
that policies be based on consistency and basic preservation guidelines. Highest
priority should go to the preservation and restoration of historically and
architecturally significant structures and sites that express the unique
characteristics of the particular periods in which they were built.
125
22:429.3 (HD)
[a] Preservation Guidelines. In addition to the above-mentioned criteria, the
Historic District Commission shall use specific Preservation Guidelines
which shall be prepared by the Commission to outline and describe the
evaluation criteria used in assessing the appropriateness of proposed
project work within the designated Historic Districts. These Preservation
Guidelines shall be prepared and periodically amended by Historic District
Commission action as part of the regular duties of the Commission and
shall be adopted by the Commission prior to their application in the
review process.
[b] Secretary of the Interior Standards. The Historic District Commission shall
utilize those criteria in "Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings
(Revised 1983)." The Standards are as follows:
[ i] Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environment, or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
[ ii] The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment should not be destroyed.
The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
[iii] All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
[ iv] Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
[ v] Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity
[vii] Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features
should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated
by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural
elements from other buildings or structures.
126
22:429.3 (HD)
[viii] The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
[ ix] Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
[ x] Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size,
scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood
or environment.
[ xi] Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
[c] Reviewing Non-Contributing Structures. Non-contributing structures
should be controlled only to the degree necessary to make them
compatible with the general atmosphere of any district with regard to
exterior alteration, additions, signs, site work and related activities.
8. Demolitions.
(a) General Provisions. No structure or resource within any Historic District shall be
demolished and/or removed unless such demolition has been reviewed by the Historic
District Commission and a Certificate of Appropriateness for such demolition and/or
removal has been granted.
(b) Procedure and Postponement Orders
1. The Historic District Commission shall hold a public hearing for the purpose of
considering Certificates of Appropriateness for demolition or removal. After such
hearing, the Historic District Commission may approve the Certificate of
Appropriateness authorizing the demolition or may enter an order postponing
demolition for up to ninety (90) days.
2. At the conclusion of such period of postponement as specified in the Historic
District Commission's order, the Commission shall within forty-five (45) days
thereafter hold a second public hearing to consider whether or not to recommend
to the City Council that additional postponement of demolition be ordered.
3. In the event that the Historic District Commission recommends additional
postponement to the City Council, the City Council shall hold a public hearing for
the purpose of considering additional postponement of demolition.
127
22:429.3 (HD)
4. After such public hearing, the City Council may enter an order approving the
demolition or may enter an order postponing demolition for an additional period
not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date of such order. At the conclusion of this
final postponement period, the City Council shall hold a public hearing and may
either approve the requested demolition or may disapprove such requested
demolition. In the event demolition is not approved, no demolition shall occur.
For purposes of this Ordinance, the word "demolition" shall include "removal."
(c) Criteria for Review of Demolitions. The Historic District Commission and City Council
shall be guided by the following criteria in considering Certificates of Appropriateness and
authorizations for demolition or removal of structures or sites within the Historic District:
1. The purposes and intent of this Ordinance.
2. The degree to which the proposed removal of the historical resource would
damage or destroy the integrity and continuity of the Historic District of which it
is a part.
3. The nature of the resource as a representative type of style of architecture, a socioeconomic
development, a historical association, or other element of the original
designation criteria applicable to such structure or site.
4. The condition of the resource from the standpoint of structural integrity and the
extent of work necessary to stabilize the structure.
5. The alternatives available to the demolition applicant, including:
[a] Donation of the subject structure or site to a public or benevolent agency.
[b] Donation of a part of the value of the subject structure or site to a public or
benevolent agency, including the conveyance of historical easements.
[c] The possibility of sale of the structure or site, or any part thereof, to a
prospective purchaser capable of preserving such structure or site.
[d] The potential of such structure or site for renovation and its potential for
continuing same.
[e] The potential of the subject structure or site for rezoning in an effort to
render such property more compatible with the physical potential of the
structure.
6. The ability of the subject structure or site to produce a reasonable economic return
on investment to its owner; provided however, that it is specifically intended that
this factor shall not have exclusive control and effect, but shall be considered
along with all other criteria contained in this Section.
128
22:429.3 (HD)
9. Exceptions.
A Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be required under the following conditions:
(a) No exterior changes. No COA is required for any work affecting the exterior of a structure
that does not alter the character of the exterior appearance of the resource; or for any work
for which a building permit or any other City permit or certificate is not required for any
work where the purpose of such work is stabilization and/or ordinary maintenance and
repair. The painting or repainting of any structure shall be considered ordinary
maintenance and repair, regardless of color.
(b) Meets All Requirements for Ordinary Maintenance and Repair. See Section 2t for
definition of ordinary maintenance and repair. Any work not satisfying all of the
requirements for ordinary maintenance and repair as defined in Section 2t. shall not be
considered ordinary maintenance and repair. The construction or enlargement of a
driveway or parking area shall not be considered ordinary maintenance and repair.
(c) Interior Changes Only. Any work affecting the interior of a structure for which a building
permit or any other City permit or certificate is required but which does not alter the
exterior appearance of the structure does not require a Certificate of Appropriateness.
(d) Administrative Bypass for the Certificate of Appropriateness. A Certificate of
Appropriateness may be granted by the Historic Preservation Officer or authorized
designee for the following:
1. Installation of storm windows or storm doors
2. Roofing or reroofing of any structure with materials that are very similar in
appearance and composition, regardless of color, provided the building is not
structurally altered during the roofing or reroofing process.
3. The Historic Preservation Officer shall inform the Historic District Commission of
Administrative Bypass actions at its next regular meeting. If a request for
Administrative Bypass is denied by the Historic Preservation Officer, the applicant
shall have the right to submit an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness to
the Historic District Commission to be reviewed at its next regularly scheduled
meeting time in order to request formal action regarding approval or denial of the
Certificate of Appropriateness. All application fees and requirements shall apply.
129
22:429.3 (HD)
10. Appeals.
(a) Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Historic District Commission, excluding
postponements as defined in Section 8(b)(1-4), shall have such right of appeal to the City
Council within ten (10) days from the decision of the Historic District Commission. Any
appeal of a decision of the Historic District Commission shall be initiated by filing a
"Notice of Appeal" in the Office of the City Clerk. Such "Notice of Appeal" shall be
docketed for placement on the City Council Agenda within thirty (30) days of filing.
(b) Aggrieved persons must exhaust all administrative processes before any appeal is valid.
11. Penalty.
(a) Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this Ordinance shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine as provided for in Section 440.3(a) of this chapter. A
violation exists whenever there is a performance of an act which is prohibited by the
provisions of this Ordinance, or a failure to perform an act which is required by this
Ordinance. Each day this Ordinance is violated shall be considered a separate offense. (O-
9900-11; O-0405-26)
(b) In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, externally reconstructed,
externally altered, added to or demolished in violation of this Ordinance, the City or any
person may institute an appropriate action or proceeding in a court with competent
jurisdiction to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, exterior
alteration, addition or demolition, and the violating party shall pay all court costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorney's fee, if the court should find in favor of the City
or persons suing on behalf of the City to enforce this Ordinance.
12. City Council Approval of Revisions to Preservation Guidelines. (O-0708-35)
(a) Upon receiving or drafting a proposed revision of the Preservation Guidelines, the Historic
District Commission shall submit said revisions to the City Council along with a
recommendation for approval or disapproval. Said report shall outline efforts made to
gather community input from residents of the Historic District as well as summarize such
input. (O-0708-35)
(b) Upon City Council receiving said revisions, City Council shall have the duty to review
proposed revisions and vote to either approve or disapprove the inclusion of the revisions

runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning maps.
4. Horizontal Zones are hereby established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all noninstrument
runways and 10,000 feet for all instrument runways from the center of each end of
the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent
to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
133
22:429.4
(Airport Height Ordinance)
5. Conical Zone for Instrument and Non-Instrument Runway is hereby established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal
distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the instrument and non-instrument
approach zones and transition zones and horizontal zone.
SECTION IV: AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS
Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and
no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this Ordinance to a height in excess of the
applicable height herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each of the zones in question as follows and as defined in FAR Part 77, hereby incorporated
by reference:
1. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. Slopes fifty (50) feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending
to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes
upward forty (40) feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance
of 40,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
2. Runway Larger than Utility with a Visibility Minimum as low as ¾ Mile Non-Precision
Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes thirty-four (34) feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
3. Transition Zone. Slopes seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of
and at the same elevation as the primary surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty
(150) feet above the airport elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established
height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and
at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical
surface. Further, where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects through and
beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and
extending a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the edge of the instrument
approach zone measured at right angles to the extended runway centerline.
4. Horizontal Zone. Established at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport
elevation.
5. Conical Zone. Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the
periphery of the horizontal and at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation and
extending to a height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation.
6. Excepted Height Limitation. Nothing in this Ordinance/Regulation shall be construed as
prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or growth of any tree to a height
up to fifty (50) feet above the surface of the land.
134
22:429.4
(Airport Height Ordinance)
SECTION V: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
1. Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed in this Ordinance shall not be
construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or
tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this Ordinance, or otherwise
interfere with the continuing use of a nonconforming structure.
Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction or alteration of any
structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance, and is diligently prosecuted.
2. Marking and Lighting. Nothwithstanding the preceding provision of this Section, the owner of
any existing nonconforming structure may be notified of such nonconforming structure.
Through such notification, such owner will be advised of the need for installation, operation,
and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as deemed advisable by the FAA to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport
obstruction. Such markers and lights, if installed would be installed, operated, and maintained
at the expense of Max Westheimer Airport.
SECTION VI: PERMITS
1. Future Structures. Except as specifically provided in a, b, and c hereunder no structure shall
be erected or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall
have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for
which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether
the resulting structure would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such
determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a structure
inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted unless a variance has been
approved in accordance with Section VI, 4.
a. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit
shall be required for any structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above
the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features,
such structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
b. In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a horizontal distance of
not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for
any structure less than seventy-five of vertical height above the ground, except when
such structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach
zones.
c. In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of
the horizontal, no permit shall be required for any structure less than seventy-five
feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such structure, because of
terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such transition zones.
135
22:429.4
(Airport Height Ordinance)
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be constructed as permitting or
intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure in excess of any of the
height limits established by this Ordinance except as set forth in Section IV, 6.
2. Existing Structures. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation
of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming structure to become a greater hazard to air
navigation, than it was on the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto or
than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
such a permit shall be granted.
3. Nonconforming Structures Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Planning and Community
Development Staff determines that a nonconforming structure has been abandoned or more
than eighty (80%) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow such structure to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise
deviate from the zoning regulations.
4. Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this Ordinance, may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance. The application for a variance from such regulations shall be
accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of
the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable
airspace. If the FAA does not respond to the application within thirty (30) days after receipt,
the Board of Adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal in specific cases,
such variances from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions would result in an
unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this ordinance shall not be granted by the
Board of Adjustment unless and until:
a. An applicant shall submit to the Board of Adjustment a written application indicating:
(1) That special conditions and circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land,
structure, or building involved and are not applicable to other lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district;
(2) That the literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive
the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district
under the terms of this ordinance;
(3) The process and fees charged shall comply with the requirements as delineated
in the City of Norman, Chapter 22  Zoning Ordinance, ARTICLE XII 
ADMINISTRATION, Section 411.
5. Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is
deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this Ordinance and be reasonable in the
circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure in question to install,
operate, and maintain, at the owners expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary.
136

appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Department of Planning and Community Development
shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
3. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the
Department of Planning and Community Development certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the
notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would
in the opinion of the Department of Planning and Community Development cause imminent peril to
life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the Board of
Adjustment on notice to the Department of Planning and Community Development and on due cause
shown.
4. The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals, give public notice and due
notice to the parties in interest (the applicant and the airport administrator), and decide the same
within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any part may appear in person or by agent or by
attorney.
5. The Board of Adjustment may, in conforming with the provisions of the Ordinance, reverse or affirm
in whole or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and
may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as may be appropriate under the
circumstances.

SEC. 429.5  NORTHERN COMMUNITY SEPARATOR OVERLAY DISTRICT
(Created by Ord. No. O-0405-24  November 16, 2004)
1. Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to:
a. Implement the NORMAN 2025 Land Use and Transportation Plan;
b. Provide a visual separation and buffer between the City of Norman and the City of
Oklahoma City and unincorporated Cleveland County;
c. Maintain a rural, open space character in the area; and,
d. To protect the Little River watershed.
2. Identification and Establishment of District. The Northern Community Separator District is hereby
created within the City of Norman as depicted on the Northern Community Separator District Map,
dated November 16, 2004, and attached hereto. The Northern Community Separator District
includes lands lying between the City of Norman and the City of Oklahoma City and portions of
unincorporated Cleveland County. It is situated between Broadway Avenue and 72nd Avenue NE,
extending north of Franklin Road to Indian Hill Road. Currently, the area is generally
undeveloped or in agricultural use, with some very low-density residential development. The area
is designated Country Residential and Floodplain in the NORMAN 2025 Land Use and
Transportation Plan. Because of its unusual physical and visual sensitivity, it is also designated as
a Special Planning Area in the plan.
3. Applicability. The provisions of this Section 429.5 shall apply to all properties and all
development located within the Northern Community Separator District within the boundaries of
the City of Norman. The use and area regulations of the underlying A-2, Rural Agricultural
District (Section 420.2) shall continue to apply as relevant to all properties except to the extent
they conflict with the provisions of this Section 429.5.
4. Parcels and Lots Located Partially or Wholly Within Floodplain. Transfer Of Permitted
Development Density. Any parcel or lot within the Northern Community Separator District, a
portion of which is located wholly or partially within the floodplain of the Little River or its
tributaries shall comply with the transfer of density and other requirements provided in Section
429.1.4(h) of the Flood Hazard District.
5. Building Setbacks From Indian Hill Road.
(a) Minimum Setbacks -- All buildings or structures shall set back a minimum distance of four
hundred (400) feet from the centerline of Indian Hill Road. No development shall be
allowed in this setback area except as provided in this Section 429.5. This setback area
shall be subject to a platted building line or other protective mechanism in a form
acceptable to the City of Norman to ensure that it remains undeveloped.
(b) Existing Structures -- Existing legally conforming structures or buildings within the four
hundred foot setback may be expanded a total of one-thousand (1,000) square feet or
twenty-five percent (25%) in square footage, whichever is larger, notwithstanding any
noncompliance with the provisions of this section.
139
22:429.5
(Northern Community Separator)
(c) Administrative Adjustments  In cases in which the physical dimensions or configuration
of a legal lot filed of record as of the date of this ordinance (November 16, 2004) prevent
compliance with the provisions of this Section 429.5, or the application of the
requirements of this section in combination with application with other regulations
contained in Section 429.1-FH, Flood Hazard District or other provisions of Chapter 22
may result in intrusion into the floodplain or other sensitive natural areas, the Director of
Planning and Community Development shall have the authority to modify the setback
requirements of this section by up to twenty percent (20%).
6. Access/Driveway Location Standards. For the purpose of reducing proliferation of visually
intrusive driveways or access roads in the Indian Hill Road building setback area required above,
to the maximum extent practicable, access to lots and parcels in the district shall be from roads
running north and south (including Broadway, Porter Avenue, 12th Avenue NE, 24th Avenue NE,
36th Avenue NE, 48th Avenue NE, 60th Avenue NE, 72nd Avenue NE, and any north-south public
road constructed in the future), not Indian Hill Road. Where access from Indian Hill Road is the
only practicable alternative, common driveways shall be used to serve multiple lots. To facilitate
the use of common driveways, the Director of Planning and Community Development shall have
authority to modify the lot width and related regulations set forth in Section 420.2.4(d) of the A-2,
Rural Agricultural District.

is also a gateway to downtown Norman and has the opportunity to become an extension of Main
Street. Due to Porter Avenues significance and potential for redevelopment within the City of
Norman, the Porter Corridor Zoning Overlay District is established. It is intended as a first step to
provide the following for properties at the commercial/residential edge:
a. Balance business interests along the corridor with the interests of adjacent neighborhoods
b. Maintain the integrity and improve viability of the adjacent residential neighborhoods
c. Emphasize pedestrian movement and pedestrian orientation of streets and buildings

properties which are adjacent to the extent of commercial development line as shown on Exhibit A
and are on the Porter Avenue side of that line.
5. Applicability. The Standards of this Section shall apply to the following changes on properties
defined in 4 above:
a. Any new construction on a lot
b. Any demolition and reconstruction on a lot
c. Any expansion of a parking lot
d. Any property that is rezoned for commercial land uses.
Any proposed modification(s) to this Zoning Overlay District shall require actual notice to the
affected property owners.
6. Appeals. Appeals from administrative decisions by the Director shall be to City Council through
the Planning Commission. These decisions may include, but are not limited to, decisions
concerning the interpretation or administration of this ordinance. The fee for such an appeal shall
be the same fee as an appeal on a zoning action.

any support facilities, and also include access to a public street or accessible
parking area. Ownership of lease of a separate parcel to accommodate the tower
and support facilities may require platting and improvements before construction
permits can be issued.
(c) Construction. In order to minimize visual impacts that can result from the presence
of such facilities, towers (including attached antennae) are limited to monopole
construction and may not exceed 200 feet in height, except in the PL and C-1
zoning districts where height is limited 90 feet.
(d) Setbacks. No commercial tower shall be located closer than 200 feet to the
boundary line of any property zoned or used for any residential purpose or within
200 feet of any residential structure on the same lot. In the PL and C-1 Districts,
the tower or structure must observe a setback from any property line zoned or used
for a residential purpose a distance equal to twice the height of the structure. All
towers shall observe a minimum setback from any abutting street right-of-way
equal to the height of the tower.
(e) Appearance. No lights, signals, or illumination shall be permitted on any tower
unless required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), or City agency. No commercial advertising,
signage, or flags shall be allowed on any tower. This shall not prevent the joint use
of a legal existing sign structure as a support mechanism for antennae or
microwave dishes. Towers and accessory facilities should be colored or painted in
muted tones that minimize their visibility, unless otherwise required by the FCC or
FAA. Within the PL and C-1 District, only towers utilizing stealth technology will
be allowed. A stealth tower is a commercial communications tower that is
incorporated into other equipment such that the facility is not readily recognizable
as telecommunications equipment, and in fact may have a different primary
function. Stealth towers may include, but are not limited to: sports lighting
facilities at athletic fields, flagpoles which have fully enclosed antennas, shoe
box or shielded parking lot lights with fully enclosed or shielded antennas,
crosses, church steeples, or clock towers. Such facilities may replicate, duplicate,
or simulate the construction of common structures that serve a dual purpose. Any
rejection by Staff of proposed stealth technology may be appealed to the Board of
Adjustment.
155
22:431.2
(f) Site Design. The area containing the monopole and accessory structures and any
immediate surrounding area utilized for servicing of the communication tower
shall be secured by a 7 foot tall chain link fence, and the area within the fence
paved or graveled and kept weed-free. Other than the street side of the site, any
side that faces any residential use shall include opaque fencing and six foot tall
evergreen shrubs or trees spaced six feet on center that are sufficient to screen the
site. If security lighting is installed, such light should be directed into the site and
only triggered by motion detectors.
(g) Co-location. To minimize tower proliferation, all reasonable efforts should be
made to co-locate facilities on existing or new towers. If not possible,
communication towers shall be located at least 1,000 feet apart. Antennae may be
placed wholly within any building legally permitted in a commercial or industrial
zoning district, or any publically-owned building. A commercial antenna may be
mounted flush to the exterior of such buildings if painted and integrated into the
overall architectural design. Roof-mounted antennae may not extend more than 20
feet above the highest point of the roof structure, provided any supporting
equipment is screened from nearby residential districts. Antennae may be attached
to any utility structure (such as a water tower or electrical transmission tower) or
public building not located in a street right-of-way, if the property is owned by a
government or public agency, further provided that the antennae do not extend
more than 20 feet above the height of the structure.
(h) Application Process. Before any construction permit can be issued, an application
for a Pre-Development meeting must be submitted which complies with the
requirements of 22:442.1 and demonstrates compliance with the provisions
contained herein, as well as applicable building codes, including an Engineers
structural certification of the tower structure.
(i) Maintenance, Operation and Removal. The owner of the communication tower
shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with Applicable Codes and the
applicable standards for commercial communication towers established by the
Telecommunications Industries Association, as may be amended from time to time,
in order to ensure the structural integrity of the tower. The failure to maintain
structural integrity through compliance with these standards is hereby declared a
public nuisance and the Commercial Communication Tower may be abated,
including the removal of the Commercial Communication Tower under authority
of and in compliance with the City Council's powers to declare and abate public
nuisances. No antenna may be used which, by design or by actual operation,
causes interference on any frequency actually used by any police, fire, or public
ambulance service having authority or jurisdiction over any portion of the City of
Norman.
156
22:431.2
(j) Removal of Abandoned Towers. Any Commercial Communication Tower that is
not actually used as an antenna support for a continuous period of twelve (12)
months shall be considered abandoned, and the permit owner(s) for such antenna(s)
or Commercial Communication Tower shall remove same at their expense within
ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the City of Norman notifying the permit
owner of said abandonment. In the event that such a Commercial Communication
Tower is not removed, notice of the intent by the City to remove shall be given to
the applicant and to the owner of the real estate on which the Commercial
Communication Tower is located if different from the applicant. Abandoned
Commercial Communication Towers are hereby declared a public nuisance,
removable by the City Council in accordance with nuisance abatement procedures
or through the claims on a posted bond.

3. Other Factors Determining Off-Street Parking Requirements.
(a) Fractional Spaces. When determination of the number of spaces required by this
ordinance results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction less than 1/2 shall be
disregarded and any fraction of 1/2 or more shall require one space.
(b) Enlarged/Changed Use.
(1) Residential Uses: Whenever there occurs a change in residential use, by either an
increase or a decrease in the number of units or by a change in the type of
residential use, all the required off-street parking, including the parking provided
for the existing use, shall conform to the requirements herein established.
(2) Non-residential Use: Whenever non-residential land, structures, or uses are
enlarged, expanded, or changed there shall be provided for the increment only of
such land, structures, and uses enlarged, expanded or changed and maintained as
herein required, at least the amount of off-street parking space that would be
required hereunder if the increment were a separate land, structure, or use.
However, where a lot with an existing structure is cleared and a new structure is
erected thereon, there shall be provided and maintained off-street parking space as
required herein.
(c) Joint Use. When an off-street parking space is used jointly by two or more uses with
different requirements, or two or more uses having the same requirements, an area shall be
provided equal to the total of requirements of all uses.
(d) Landscaping of Existing Parking Lots. A ten (10) percent reduction in the number of
spaces required by this ordinance is permitted when landscaping as required by Section
22-431.8 is provided for existing parking lots that are not subject to landscaping
requirements. Landscaping improvements must be acceptable to the Director of Planning.
4. Bicycle Parking Facilities
(Ord. No. O-0809-44  June 23, 2009)
(a) For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established after the effective
date of this ordinance (July 23, 2009), accessory bicycle parking shall be provided as
required by these regulations. Where a building permit has been issued prior to the
effective date of this ordinance, and provided that construction is begun within one
hundred eighty (180) days of such effective date, bicycle parking facilities in the amounts
required for the issuance of said building permit are not required.
(b) Whenever the existing use of a building or structure is enlarged or expanded, or additional
parking installed for such expansion, bicycle parking facilities shall be provided for the
new increment only of such enlarged or expanded building or parking area in at least the
amount that would be required if the enlarged use or expanded parking area was a separate
use or parking area.
(c) Residential Use. For residential lots containing more than three dwelling units on the same
lot, there shall be one bicycle parking space provided for the first eight (8) car parking
spaces, and one bicycle space for each ten (10) car spaces provided thereafter. Singlefamily,
two-family, and three-family units on the same lot are exempt from the
requirement to provide bicycle parking facilities.
171
22:431.5
(d) Commercial, Industrial, Office, and Institutional Uses. For other non-residential uses,
there shall be one bicycle parking space provided for any parking area containing at least
eight car spaces, and one additional bicycle space for each twenty (20) car spaces
thereafter.
(e) Design. Each bicycle parking space shall be sufficient to accommodate a bicycle at least
six (6) feet in length and two (2) feet wide, and shall be provided with some form of stable
frame permanently anchored to the ground or the building structure to which a bicycle
frame and both wheels may be conveniently secured, with at least two points of contact
with the bicycle, using a chain and padlock and/or U-shaped locking device. Figure 1
shows the types of racks that are recommended and those that may not be used. The
separation of the bicycle parking spaces and the amount of corridor space shall be
adequate for convenient access to every space when the parking facility is full. Figure 2
shows the minimum dimensions for bicycle racks in open or enclosed areas.
(f) Location. All bicycle parking spaces required by this ordinance shall be located on the
same zoning lot as the use served and shall be located in a clearly designated, safe and
convenient location near the entrance of the use being served and within view of
pedestrian traffic, if possible, to reasonably reduce the likelihood of bicycle theft. In
multi-family areas, bicycle parking should be distributed throughout the complex near the
entrance to each major building, preferably in a well-lighted area that is weather-protected.
(g) Surface. Bicycle parking facilities shall be designed and maintained to be mud and dust
free. A durable hard surface is required, but alternative paving material may be used,
including gravel or stone, provided that edging materials such as landscape timbers, are
used so that the bicycle parking area is clearly demarcated and the rock material is
contained.

SEC. 431.6 -- COMMERCIAL OUTDOOR LIGHTING STANDARDS
(Established by Ord. No. O-1011-44  June 21, 2011. Amended by: O-1213-38  March 26, 2013)
1. Purpose and Intent. It is the intent of this Section to define practical and effective measures by which the
obtrusive aspects of commercial outdoor light usage can be minimized, while preserving safety, security, and
the nighttime use and enjoyment of property. These measures are intended to reduce light spillover, minimize
glare, and decrease resource waste.
2. Conformance with Applicable Codes. All new commercial outdoor lighting shall be installed in
conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance, as well as the currently adopted versions of the Building
Code, the Electrical Code, and the Sign Code of the City of Norman as applicable and under appropriate permit
and inspection, whichever is the more restrictive.
3. Applicability.
(a) Building Construction. For all public or private commercial, industrial, institutional, and multifamily
land uses, developments, buildings, and structures that require a permit subsequent to the
effective date of this Section (July 22, 2011), all new outdoor lighting fixtures shall meet the
requirements of this Section of the Code.
(b) These lighting regulations do not apply to properties zoned or used for single-family or two-family
dwellings.
(c) Exempt Lighting. The following luminaires and lighting systems are exempt from these
requirements:
(1) Internally illuminated signs.
(2) Temporary lighting for theatrical, television, and performance areas.
(3) Lighting for non-commercial public or private athletic fields and recreational facilities,
although any such lighting should be mounted, aimed, and shielded so that lighting primarily
falls within the boundaries of such athletic fields and recreational facilities and lights are
extinguished when not in use.
(4) Lighting in swimming pools and other water features governed by the most recently adopted
National Electrical Code.
(5) Lighting for police, fire, and other emergency services, or required by any state or federal
agency, such as the FAA.
(6) Interior lighting.
(7) Temporary holiday lighting.
(8) Low-voltage landscape lighting.
(9) Exterior lights that are mounted within interior courtyards or other areas of the building that
are not visible from any abutting residential property.
(10) Decorative and architectural lighting of bridges, public monuments, or public art, although all
luminaires should be installed to minimize glare and be shielded such that no glare is visible
from any abutting property.
(11) New street lights installed within public rights-of-way.
(12) New lighting to be placed on historic properties such that it is important that the new lighting
be in harmony with the period lighting of the property.
(13) Luminaires that are used exclusively to provide emergency power illumination at exit
discharge locations that operate only from an emergency power source in the event of a normal
power failure. (O-1213-38)
175
22:431.6
(d) Prohibited Lighting. The following luminaires and lighting systems may not be used or installed
within the City of Norman:
(1) The use of laser source light or any similar high-intensity light for outdoor advertising or
entertainment.
(2) The operation of searchlights for advertising purposes.
4. Compliance.
(a) Whenever a complaint about lighting is received, it shall be investigated to determine if
corrective action is warranted. Corrective action is warranted when a Code Enforcement or
Police Officer finds evidence of glare; light spillover onto property zoned or used for single or
two-family dwellings located either adjacent to or across the street from the subject property; or
a visible bulb from an adjacent single or two-family property. Corrective action includes:
shielding, re-aiming, or replacement of a fixture with a full cut-off fixture. (O-1213-38)
(b) A one-time hardship extension may be administratively granted for up to 180 days, but the
applicant must agree in writing to comply with this section of the Code and submit a plan for
compliance.
(c) If the administrative exception is denied, that decision may be appealed to the Board of
Adjustment, who may grant the extension as a Special Exception.
(d) An additional one year extension above the six month administrative extension may be granted
as a Special Exception by the Board of Adjustment provided (a) lights within twenty-five feet of
any residential boundary have been modified to comply with this section, and (b) the extent of
the renovation is large enough to require additional time based on the difficulty in finding
compatible lights or the cost of the retrofit must be amortized over a longer timeframe. Property
owners may re-apply to the Board for an additional one year extension, provided that a specific
plan of compliance has been provided to the Board demonstrating extreme hardship.
5. General Outdoor Lighting Standards.
(a) Fixture Standards.
(1) Except as otherwise provided, all new nonexempt outdoor lighting fixtures shall be full cut-off
fixtures mounted horizontally to the ground that prevent excessive light from going upward;
outdoor luminous tube lighting does not require shielding. (O-1213-38)
(2) Ordinary maintenance of existing fixtures, including replacement of lamps, is specifically
allowed. If existing fixtures are removed in order to upgrade, redesign, or reconfigure the
lighting design on the property, then such fixtures must conform to the requirements of this
section. (O-1213-38)
(b) Pole Mounted Lights.
(1) The maximum light level at any point on a property line of a parcel zoned or used for single or
two-family dwellings, located either adjacent to or across the street from the subject property,
shall not exceed 0.2 footcandles. (O-1213-38)
(2) Shielding must be permanently installed to ensure continued compliance with this requirement.
(3) Parking lots should be illuminated to a minimum level of 0.2 footcandles. (O-1213-38)
176
22:431.6
(4) Light poles installed within twenty-five (25) feet of any residential property line or public
right-of-way may not exceed twenty (20) feet in height. All other light poles may not exceed
thirty (30) feet in height except in instances of the expansion of a development, pole height
may correspond with the height of existing poles. Height is measured to the underside of the
lens, and includes any concrete base. (O-1213-38)
(c) Lights Mounted to Walls of Buildings or Structures.
(1) All wall mounted lighting on buildings or structures shall be full cut-off fixtures.
(2) When such new lights are installed on a wall, the lights may not exceed a mounting height
above the roof line of the building or structure.
(3) New lights mounted on the underside of any roof overhang shall be fully recessed so that the
lens cover is flush with the bottom surface of the overhang.
(d) Accent Lighting.
(1) Except as allowed under 5(d)(2) below, new fixtures used for accent lighting shall be full cutoff,
or directionally shielded lighting fixtures that are aimed and controlled so that the directed
light is substantially confined to the object intended to be illuminated. All such lights shall be
aimed and shielded to prevent excessive light from going upward.
(2) Fixture types may include floodlights, wall sconces, lanterns, recessed can lights, architectural
or decorative lights, or any other fixture that meets the intent of this section. Decorative
architectural wall mounted fixtures are not required to be cut-off, semi cut-off, or full cut-off
fixtures, so long as such fixtures do not result in any glare as later defined or light spillover of
greater than 0.2 footcandles onto any residential property zoned or used for single or twofamily
dwellings located either adjacent to or across the street from the subject property. (O-
1213-38)
(3) Lighting required for the night-time display of the American flag may be of any type or
intensity, but if directed up towards the flag, the light fixtures shall be installed to minimize
glare and shielded such that the light source is not visible from any property zoned or used for
single or two-family dwellings located either adjacent to or across the street from the subject
property. (O-1213-38)
(e) Canopy Lighting. New lighting under canopies shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking
place in such locations (a minimum of 0.2 footcandles). Any facility utilizing a drive-through area
such as banks, service stations, convenience stores, car washes, etc., shall comply with the
following requirements:
(1) New light fixtures mounted in canopies or soffits for drive-through locations shall be installed
so that the bulb is fully recessed and the lens is flush with the bottom surface of the canopy,
soffit, or overhang.
(2) Fuel dispensing locations shall be illuminated so that the minimum lighting level is at least ten
(10) lumens per square foot of the canopy area. (O-1213-38)
(3) Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) shall be illuminated so that the minimum lighting level is
at least five (5) lumens per square foot measured within a ten foot radius of the ATM. (O-
1213-38)
177
22:431.6

by a written opinion from a professional engineer, electrical contractor, or representative of
the lighting industry that the lighting plan complies with the standards of this section. (O-
1213-38)
(2) The estimated footcandles at ten feet beyond all property boundaries that are adjacent to or
are across the street from single or two-family residential zones or uses; (O-1213-38)
(3) To the extent that such information is readily available from the supplier of each light
source, a table indicating the type, light source, wattage, initial output in lumens, light loss
ratio, height of luminaires above grade, and the maximum to minimum ratio. (O-1213-38)
(4) To the extent that such information is readily available from the supplier of each light
source, manufacturers catalogue specifications of all luminaires to be used, indicating the

SEC. 431.7 -- DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF OFF STREET PARKING
FACILITIES (As Amended by Ord. No. O-8788-27 -- January 12, 1988; O-8788-57  June 28, 1988;
O-8889-41 -- April 11, 1989; O-9091-28 -- April 23, 1991; O-9899-26  March 23, 1999; O-0405-30 
January 24, 2006; O-0506-62  July 25, 2006; O-1314-15  April 22, 2014)
1. Location of Off-Street Parking Spaces.
(a) In a residential district, no part of a lot or tract shall be used as a parking space for a motor
vehicle, boat, trailer, or other vehicle of equivalent or larger size, except upon an approved
pavement surface which meets the requirements of this section. (O-0405-30; O-1314-15)
(b) In a commercial district, no part of a lot or tract shall be used as a parking space for a motor
vehicle, boat, trailer, or other vehicle of equivalent or larger size, except upon an approved
pavement surface which meets the requirements of this section. Vehicle and equipment storage
yards that are completely enclosed by an opaque fence are excepted from this requirement.
(O-1314-15)
(c) Citations for illegal parking. Issuance. Whenever any vehicle without a driver is found parked
or stopped in violation of the restriction imposed by this section, the inspector finding the
vehicle shall take its registration number and any other information displayed on the vehicle
which may identify its owner, and shall conspicuously affix to the vehicle a citation in writing
on a form provided by the City for the owner of the vehicle to answer the charge against
him/her within ten (10) days at the time and place specified in the citation; or, if the
registration cannot be obtained, mail a notice letter to the property owner, tenant, or occupant
of such location that such vehicle appears to be in violation of this section and that he has ten
(10) days from the date of the notification and the posting of the property to relocate the
vehicle onto a legal parking surface. If the vehicle is not moved to a legal parking surface
within the specified time period, the inspector may issue a citation to the property owner. The
inspector shall deliver copies of the citation to the Traffic Division of the Municipal Court.
(O-1314-15)
(1) Administrative payment of citation. Any person may elect to pay a fine to the Court
Clerk in lieu of appearing before the Municipal Court for formal arraignment.
[a] Persons electing to so administratively pay their fines, shall first file with the
Court Clerk an appearance form, a guilty plea form, and a court appearance
waiver form.
[b] Persons electing to so administratively pay their fines shall pay twenty dollars
($20.00) per each violation.
(2) Formal arraignment. Any person electing to appear before the Municipal Court for
formal arraignment, shall be subject, upon conviction, to a fine of not less than twenty
dollars ($20.00) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per each violation.
(3) Failure to comply with citation. If the owner of the vehicle does not respond in
obedience to a citation affixed to the vehicle within a period of ten (10) days, the
citation shall be deemed to be delinquent and a warrant shall be issued. In the event
that the citation is thereafter prosecuted in the Court, the citation shall substantially
conform to the requirements of Section 14-307 of this Code.
179
22:431.7
(d) Presumption in reference to illegal parking.
(1) In any prosecution charging a violation of this section, proof that the vehicle described
in the citation was parked in violation of this section, together with proof that the
defendant named in the citation was at the time the citation was issued the registered
owner of the vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie presumption that the
registered owner of the vehicle was the person who parked or placed the vehicle at the
point where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred.
(2) The provisions of Subsection (2)(a) shall apply only when the procedure prescribed in
this section has been followed.
(e) Relation to Premises. Such off-street parking space may occupy part of any required yard, but
may not occupy any required livability space. For any new commercial or industrial use,
required off-street parking, which because of the size or location of the parcel cannot be
provided on the same zoning lot with the principal use, may be provided on other property not
more than 200 feet distant from the building site subject to guarantees acceptable to the
Director of Planning and Community Development, but the applicant may appeal such
guarantees to the City Manager. Such parking space shall be deemed to be required parking
associated with permitted principal use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon
in any manner. For any new residential use off-street parking shall be provided on the same
tract, adjacent to said tract, or essentially in line with same tract across the alley or street
right-of-way therefrom but not more than 200 feet distant from the building site.
(f) Parking in the Central Core Area.
(1) The Central Core Area, as defined by City council per the attached map exhibit, is
generally defined as that area south of Robinson Street, west of 12th Avenue (East),
north of Imhoff Road, and east of Berry Road.
(2) Within the Central Core Area, residential uses shall mean single-family dwellings,
duplexes, triplexes, apartments, rooming and boarding houses, and fraternities and
sororities, but not any commercial, industrial, or institutional use.
(3) All new or expanded open parking areas for any residential use shall first be installed
adjacent to any existing alley. Before new parking can be added in the front or side
yard of the structure, parking must be installed in the rear yard to the maximum extent
possible. New or expanded driveways within the front yard shall only be allowed
when they are used to provide access to new parking areas in the rear yard. New or
expanded parking areas within the front yard will only be approved after a review and
determination by the Planning Department that no other reasonable option exists.
Such determination may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
(4) For any residential use, the total amount of impervious area, including, but not limited
to, parking areas, patios, swimming pools, tennis courts, sidewalks and other similar
permanent improvements, together with the ground floor surface area of all principal
and accessory structures, may not exceed 65% of the total lot area. This percentage
shall not apply when existing pavement is repaired or replaced (but not expanded),
although a permit for such work shall still be obtained.
(5) When parking areas for residential uses are proposed on lots that are adjacent to or
across the street from the principal residential use, the above limitations shall apply.
(O-0405-30)
180
22:431.7
(g) Vision Clearance at Intersections. Off-street parking shall observe the provisions of Section
431.1 (h) of this Code. Also, when a driveway intersects a public right-of-way, an
unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between two (2) and eight (8) feet shall be allowed in
the triangular areas on both sides of the driveway; two sides of each triangle being ten (10) feet
in length from the point of intersection of the driveway and public right-of-way and the third
side being a line connecting the ends of the other two sides. No parking shall be permitted in
these triangular areas. (O-7980-2; O-0405-30)
2. Development and Maintenance of Off-Street Parking Facilities.
(a) Plans and Permits. The construction, expansion, or modification of any driveway or parking
area requires that a permit be issued by the Public works Department and Planning
Department. An applicant for a building permit must submit plans showing the off-street
parking required by this ordinance. These plans must show location, arrangement, and
dimensions of the off-street parking, turning spaces, drives, aisles, and ingress and egress in a
matter satisfactory for the safety and convenience of pedestrian, as well as vehicular, traffic.
The plans must also show landscaping materials and screening. A title block will accompany
the plan showing: scale date, north arrow, name and address of property owner, and person
drawing parking and landscaping plan. (O-0405-30)
(b) Size. Each space shall be at least eight and one-half (8-1/2) feet wide and nineteen (19) feet
long.
(c) Access. Adequate access drive shall be provided for all parking spaces not abutting a public
street or alley. Ingress and egress driveways shall be no wider than thirty (30) feet for
residential uses, and thirty-five (35) feet for commercial/industrial uses, exclusive of curb
returns. The minimum driveway width shall be ten (10) feet, except in the HD (Historic
District) where the minimum width shall be eight (8) feet, and the maximum width shall be ten
(10) feet unless the driveway was historically wider. Within the HD area only, two driveway
ribbons of eighteen (18) inches in width are allowed. (O-0506-62)
(d) Screening. All commercial, industrial, and multi-family uses and all open off-street parking
areas with more than five spaces that are located within twenty (20) feet of a common property
line shall be screened from any adjoining residentially zoned lot by a solid and opaque
ornamental fence, wall, dense evergreen hedge, berm, or effective equivalent or combination,
having a height of not less than six (6) feet. Such fence, wall, hedge, or effective equivalent
shall be maintained in good condition. Parking for all residential uses that is added in the rear
yard must be screened from all abutting properties zoned or used for residential purposes,
except that new parking which directly abuts an alley need not be screened from the alley.
Whenever parking is installed in a front or side yard that is not perpendicular to the abutting
street, those spaces must be set back from the front (or side) property line and sidewalk a
minimum distance of ten (10) feet. Within that ten (10) foot area, low-growing shrubs must be
planted three (3) feet on center and maintained in good order to screen the parking vehicle
from the street. Shrubs must be at least twelve (12) inches tall when planted, and be a species
that will grow to approximately three (3) feet in height at maturity. A three-foot tall stone or
masonry wall may be constructed as an alternative. (O-0405-30)
181
22:431.7
(e) Impervious Area. For any residential use, the total amount of pavement, including, but not
limited to, parking areas, patios, swimming pools, tennis courts, sidewalks and other similar
permanent improvements, together with the ground floor surface area of all principal and
accessory structures, may not exceed 65% of the total lot area. This percentage shall not apply
when existing pavement is repaired or replaced (but not expanded), although a permit for such
work shall still be obtained. (O-0405-30)
(f) Improvement.
(1) Surfacing, Marking, and Drainage. All off-street parking spaces and their access roads
shall be paved with an all-weather surface of asphaltic concrete, portland cement
concrete or any equivalent material acceptable to the City Engineer, and maintained
such that no dust will result from continued use. Spaces shall be arranged and marked
so as to provide for orderly and safe parking. Drainage shall be provided to dispose of
all surface water without crossing sidewalks. For lots in the A-2, A-1, or RE Districts
which do not touch or face land zoned an urban residential designation (R-1, R-1-A,
R-2, RM-2, RM-4, RM-6, R-3, or RO) the access driveway for a single family
dwelling may be paved with gravel or stone. (O-0405-30)
(2) Existing Non-conforming Parking. Gravel, crushed stone, or rock may no longer be
used for paring in the urban area, except for parking areas which were established
before July, 1966, and are continuously maintained in accordance with the
maintenance requirements of the currently adopted International Property Maintenance
Code, which is adopted in Section 10:601-602 of the City Code. If the owner of a
non-conforming gravel parking area fails to maintain such area in an orderly and
weed-free condition, a notice violation can be issued. Failure to correct any deficiency
within the prescribed time frame shall result in the property losing its legal, nonconforming
status, and require the improvement of the lot to the then-current
requirements of this code (section). (O-0405-30)
(3) Barriers/Bumpers. Except for parking areas provided for single-family and two-family
units, suitable barriers or curbs shall be provided to protect public sidewalks. Wheel
or bumper guards shall be located so that no part of any vehicle shall extend beyond
the parking area, intrude on pedestrian ways, or come in contact with walls, fences or
plantings. (O-0405-30)
(4) Landscaping. From the effective date of this ordinance, all new off-street parking
areas with six (6) or more spaces shall be landscaped as per the requirements of
Section 22-431.8. For enlarged parking areas, only the increment of expansion shall
be subject to landscaping requirements. (O-0405-30)
182
22:431.7
(5) Waiver of Surfacing Requirements for those who are disabled. The Planning Director
may, upon written request, consider a waiver of surfacing requirements which would
permit persons with a disability to park their vehicles on unimproved front or side yard
surfaces in order to allow access to a walkway suitable for safe transport to their
dwelling unit. Consideration will be given only to individuals that qualify for
Emergency Access Grant funds as administered by the City of Norman and to owners
of vehicles currently displaying a handicapped person decal. The applicant shall, in
writing, describe why he/she is unable to comply with the parking ordinance and what
special needs will be met through a waiver. After review of the letter of application,
the Planning Director shall either approve or deny the request. The Director's decision
may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment. (O-8889-41; O-0405-30)
3. Additional requirements for Parking Lots Permitted as a Special Use and for Parking Lots for Uses
Adjacent to a Residential Use or District. In any case where (1) Special Use is granted for the use of
property for off-street parking in a residential district, or (2) when parking is provided for a
commercial, industrial or church use and abuts or faces a residential district, or (3) when parking is
provided for a multi-family use abutting or facing a single-family use or district, the following
restrictions shall apply:
(a) The sides and rear of any such lot shall be screened from the residential district by a solid and
opaque ornamental fence, wall, dense evergreen hedge, berm, or effective equivalent, having a
height of not less than six (6) feet. Such fence, wall, hedge, or effective equivalent, shall be
maintained in good condition and observe the setback requirement of Paragraph (b) below.
(b) No parking shall be permitted within a front yard setback line established twenty (20) feet back
of the property line of interior and corner lots wherever the parking lot immediately abuts or is
directly across the street from the front yard of a residential unit, except as amended by Section
431.8(b)(2). On a corner lot the requirements regarding sight triangles set forth in Section
431.1 (h) must be met.
(c) All yards shall be landscaped with grass, shrubs, or evergreen ground cover and maintained in
good condition the year around.
(d) Any lighting that is installed shall have minimal impact on abutting properties. All lights
must be shielded or oriented so that the light source does not shine onto nor is visible from any
abutting property or right-of-way.
4. No person shall park, stop or stand any motor vehicle in the space between the curb line of the street
and the private property line on any street unless there be an approved cutback especially provided for
such purpose. This section shall not be construed to prevent parking of vehicles outside of the front
property line of residential property where commercial parking is allowed as a use permissible on
certain days or as Special Use. (O-0405-30)
In the event the owner of any land lying between the right-of-way lines of the street and setback lines
of his tract desires to surface with concrete or asphalt he shall first submit the plans and specifications
of the proposed cut, paving, drainage, and lot design to the City Engineer for said Engineer's
approval. In no case shall parking be permitted or any cutback for ingress and egress be constructed
with the sight triangle specified in Section 431.1 (h) of this Code. In addition, whenever a new curb
or parking area is installed, it shall be so designed and used that parked vehicles will not protrude into
the traffic lane portion of the street.
183
22:431.7
5. Space Requirements at Various Parking Angles. The table provided below furnishes the aisle width,
curb length and center-to-center widths required at various parking angles. The space requirements
applicable for 8'6" stall width shall be met or exceeded.

FACILITIES
(As amended by Ord. No. O-9091-28 -- April 23, 1991; O-9394-27 -- February 8, 1994; O-9899-26 
March 23, 1999; O-0203-10  October 22, 2002; O-0809-29  January 27, 2009; O-1617-42  June 27,
2017)
1. Intent of Landscaping Requirements. The intent of this section is to protect and promote the public
health, safety and welfare by requiring the landscaping of parking areas which will serve to reduce
wind and air turbulence, heat and noise, and the glare of automobile lights; to prevent soil erosion;
to reduce the level of carbon dioxide and return pure oxygen to the atmosphere; to provide shade;
to visually enhance the appearance of parking areas; and to generally promote a healthful and
pleasant environment. All areas used for the display, parking, or storage of any and all types of
vehicles, boats, or construction equipment are subject to provisions herein. (O-1617-42)
2. Landscaping Requirements. For all off-street parking areas, in any zoning district, having at least
six (6) parking spaces and/or other vehicular use areas of at least nine hundred (900) square feet of
impervious area to be used as parking, the owners shall provide peripheral landscaping and street
landscaping as indicated below. (O-1617-42)
(a) Peripheral Landscaping Requirements.
[1] Peripheral Landscaping shall be required along any side of a parking area that abuts
adjoining property that is not a street or alley right-of-way.
[2] A landscaping strip no less than five (5) feet in width shall be located between the
parking area and the abutting property lines.
[3] At least one tree for each forty (40) linear feet or fraction thereof shall be planted in
each landscaping strip. The required trees may be evenly spaced or grouped. The
remaining area must be covered with solid sod or live ground cover.
[4] In addition to the required trees, a wall, fence, hedge, berm, or other durable landscape
barrier shall be planted or installed. The height of any such hedge or barrier shall be
no less than six (6) feet. Such barrier shall not extend beyond the front setback line
established on the adjoining lot, except as necessary to completely screen any parking.
[5] At least one shrub or vine for each ten (10) feet of non- living durable barrier (such as
a wall or fence) shall be planted between the parking lot and the barrier.
[6] Peripheral Landscaping Requirements shall not be applicable in the following
situations:
[a] To those portions of the property that are opposite a building located on the
abutting property line.
[b] Where the abutting property is zoned for non-residential uses or is used for
another parking area, only the tree provision and the landscape strip, planted
with grass or ground cover, shall be required.
[7] Twenty (20) percent of the trees for Peripheral Landscaping Requirements can be
evergreens that normally grow to an overall height of a minimum of fifteen (15) feet.
186
22:431.8
(b) Street Landscaping Requirements.
[1] Street landscaping shall be required along any side of a parking lot that abuts the
right-of-way of any street, road or highway.
[2] A landscaping strip ten (10) feet in depth shall be located between the abutting
right-of-way and the parking lot. For parking lots which are zoned residentially, or lie
adjacent to or directly across the street from residentially zoned land, a landscaping strip
twenty (20) feet in depth shall be provided. If a three (3) - four (4) foot masonry or rock
wall is installed adjacent to the parking area, the required landscaping strip may be
reduced to ten (10) feet in depth.
[3] At least one tree for each forty (40) linear feet or fraction thereof shall be planted in the
landscaping strip. The required trees may be evenly spaced or grouped. The remaining
area must be planted with solid sod or live ground cover.
[4] A hedge, landscaped berm, or other living durable plant barrier shall extend the entire
length of the landscaping strip. The height of any such barrier or hedge shall be no more
than three (3) feet. The first ten (10) feet on both sides of any driveway pavement is
excluded from this requirement, but shall be planted with grass or ground cover.
[5] In lieu of the requirements of subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this section, at least one tree
for each twenty (20) linear feet or fraction thereof shall be planted in the landscaping
strip. The required trees may be evenly spaced or grouped.
3. Landscaping Requirements for Off-Street Parking and Other Vehicular Use Areas Having More Than
Thirty (30) Parking Spaces. The owners shall provide Peripheral Landscaping and Street
Landscaping as indicated above and Interior Landscaping as indicated below.
(a) Automatic irrigation shall be provided to all required landscape areas.
(b) Interior Landscaping Requirements.
(1) Off-street parking areas shall have at least fifteen (15) square feet of interior
landscaping for each parking space excluding those spaces abutting a perimeter for
which landscaping is required by other sections hereof and excluding all parking
spaces which are directly served by an aisle abutting and running parallel to such a
perimeter.
(2) Each separate landscaped area shall contain a minimum of two hundred (200) square
feet, shall have a minimum dimension of at least five (5) feet, and shall include at least
two (2) trees. The remaining area shall be landscaping material not to exceed three (3)
feet in height, except for incidental pathways or sidewalks.
(3) The total number of trees shall not be less than one (1) for each one hundred (100)
square feet or fraction thereof of required interior landscaped area.
(4) Landscaping and islands shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the interior of the
parking lot. Each row of parking which terminates within the interior of the lot shall
be terminated with a landscaped island. No parking space shall be located more than
eighty-five (85) feet from a portion of landscaped open space required by this section.
187
22:431.8
4. Plant Material. Species of plant material shall be acceptable to the Director of Planning (see
Appendix F for a list of acceptable plant materials).
(a) Trees.
(1) For the purposes of this ordinance, trees are defined as any self-supporting woody
plants which usually produce one main trunk and normally grow to an overall height
of a minimum of fifteen (15) feet in Cleveland County. No one species may constitute
more than fifty percent of the tree species that are planted, unless the number of trees
to be installed is less than three.
(2) Trees having an average natural spread of crown less than fifteen (15) feet may be
substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a 15-foot crown
spread. Trunks must be maintained in a clean condition over five (5) feet of clear
wood.
(3) Deciduous tree species shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet overall height, with a
minimum caliper of 1 ½ immediately after planting. Evergreen trees shall be a
minimum of six (6) feet in height.
(4) Trees of species whose roots are known to cause damage to public roadways or other
public works shall not be planted closer than twelve (12) feet to such public works,
unless the tree root system is completely contained within a barrier acceptable to the
Director of Planning.
(b) Shrubs and Hedges.
(1) For the purposes of this ordinance, shrubs are defined as any woody plant that usually
remains low and produces shoots or trunks from the base.
(2) Hedges, where required shall be a minimum of two feet in height when measured
immediately after planting and shall be maintained so as to form a continuous,
unbroken, solid, visual screen within a maximum of one (1) year after planting.
(c) Vines. For the purposes of this ordinance, vines are defined as plants which normally require
support to reach mature form.
5. Alternative Landscaping Method  Xeriscape Design. In order to conserve water, the City of
Norman does encourage the application of xeriscape design principles when meeting the landscaping
requirements of this section. The term xeriscape is derived from a Greek word meaning dry.
The desired effect is not the creation of a desert environment, but the use of appropriate materials
and methods to create a green environment with a lower demand for water. The following
principles guide this philosophy.
(a) Planning and design: Consider the use of the landscape areas as well as the type of soil and
exposure to the sun. On-site detention is often required in new developments. It should be
incorporated into the overall landscape design.
(b) Limited turn area: Ground cover must be installed to prevent soil erosion. Limit turf areas,
which have a high demand for water, to locations that will be subject to heavy foot traffic.
Consider the use of native grasses that are more drought tolerant, such as Buffalo Grass.
188
22:431.8
(c) Efficient irrigation: Group plants with similar water needs so that the appropriate amount of
water can be applied at the right time. Plan to irrigate turf areas separately from other
plants. Trees and shrubs should be watered deeply to encourage good root development.
Use different types of sprinkler heads for different purposes, and consider drip irrigation for
certain plant groups. Timers and water-sensing devices that respond to rain and soil
moisture are recommended for all new installations.
(d) Soil improvement: Protect existing topsoil by stockpiling it during construction, and control
erosion using good construction practices. Test and analyze the soil, and add organic matter
to loosen soil. Gypsum should be added to heavy clay soils to lower its pH and loosen the
soil.
(e) Appropriate plant selection: Many varieties of drought tolerant plants are available that
have a lower demand for water, once established. Native species are better adapted to this
climatic zone, and should be used.
(f) Mulch: Mulch should be used around all newly planted trees and shrubs, as it saves
moisture, reduces weed growth, and adds interest, while reducing the need for turf. Mulch
should be three (3) inches deep, over soil that is covered with a breathable fabric. Avoid the
use of solid plastic sheeting.
(g) Maintenance: Turf areas should not be kept too short. Mowing height should be raised
during hot summer months. Turf areas should be mowed using a mulching mower, and
clippings left on the lawn to decompose and add nutrients back into the soil. Trees should
be pruned to enhance their appearance, improve their health, and allow good vision
throughout the parking area.
6. Other Requirements for Landscaped Areas.
(a) Installation.
(1) All landscaping shall be installed according to accepted planting procedures and
landscaped areas must be protected from vehicular encroachment by installing curbs,
bumper blocks, or other permanent barriers.
(2) A Certificate of Occupancy is required for all parking areas having six (6) or more
spaces and no certificate will be issued unless the landscaping meets the requirements
herein provided. Due to weather, season, or climatic conditions unsuitable for
planting, the installation of landscaping may be deferred by providing a Performance
Agreement in the form of cash or a certificate of deposit equal to one hundred twentyfive
(125) percent of the cost of providing and installing all required plant materials,
including any required irrigation system. The estimate shall be prepared by a
registered Landscape Architect or licensed Nurseryman. The installation will be
deferred until the next growing season, but no longer than nine months.
(b) Maintenance.
(1) The owners shall be responsible for providing, protecting, and maintaining all
landscaping in growing and healthy condition; shall replace it when necessary; and
shall keep it reasonably free from debris. Maintenance and replacement shall be
assured by providing a Maintenance and Replacement Guarantee in the form of cash, a
certificate of deposit, a letter of credit, or surety bond equal to fifty (50) percent of the
cost of all plant materials including installation before a Certificate of Occupancy is
issued. Said deposit will be held for a period of three years after the initial installation
is completed, and will be returned to the owner after reinspection of the property to
verify the viability of all required plant materials. (O-0203-10; O-0809-29)
189
22:431.8
(2) Should the owner not maintain the property as provided in paragraph (1) of this
subsection, the City of Norman has the authority to enter the premises upon written
notice and perform the necessary maintenance. The cost of performing said
maintenance shall be certified by the Director of Planning and transmitted to the
owner. Should the owner fail to pay the cost of maintenance within thirty (30) days of
receipt of said notice, the cost shall become a lien on the property.
(3) Permanent automatic irrigation is required for all interior islands in parking areas with
more than thirty (30) spaces. Automatic irrigation is not required for smaller lots,
although provision for watering all plant material must be addressed. At a minimum
hose bibs must be installed throughout the lot so that no landscape area is more than
one hundred (100) feet from a water source.
7. Landscape Plan - submittal requirements.
Four copies of a detailed Landscape Plan must be submitted in conjunction with any
application for a building permit that includes six or more parking spaces, and shall
include the following:
(a) The location of existing property lines and dimensions of the tract, accurately drawn to scale.
(b) The location of existing and proposed utilities and all easements on or adjacent to the lot.
(c) The location of all existing and proposed buildings and parking areas, including the exact
number of parking spaces.
(d) The location and dimensions of all required landscape areas, including the approximate square
footage of each interior island.
(e) Detailed sprinkler diagram,
(f) A tabulation of all plant materials, by Latin name, common name, size, type, and number of
species.
(g) The Plan shall clearly indicate the location of all plant material that is included in the
tabulation.
(h) The location, height, and type of screening or fencing that will be installed.

SEC. 433  DISTRIBUTED (SMALL) WIND TURBINES
(O-1718-14  December 28, 2017)
1. Intent. To provide for the development of clean, renewable energy resources while protecting the
public health, safety and welfare of the community. The City of Norman finds these regulations are
necessary to ensure that distributed (small) wind turbines are appropriately designed and safely sited and
installed. This ordinance establishes the regulations and criteria which allow distributed (small) wind
turbines as compatible accessory uses in residential districts.
2. Definitions.
a. Distributed (Small) Wind Turbine: A wind energy conversion system consisting of a wind turbine,
tower, and associated control or conversion electronics, which has a rated capacity of not more
than ten kilowatts and is intended to primarily reduce on-site consumption of utility power. A
system is considered a residential distributed (small) wind turbine only if it supplies electrical
power solely for on-site use, except that when a parcel on which the system is installed also
receives electrical power supplied by a utility company, excess electrical power generated and not
presently needed for on-site use may be used by the utility company.
b. Tower: The vertical component of a wind energy conversion system that elevates the wind turbine
generator and attached blades above the ground.
3. Regulations. Distributed (small) wind turbines are a permitted use in the RE, A-1 and A-2 zoning
districts subject to the following:
a. Only one distributed (small) wind turbine per residential lot.
b. The maximum rotor diameter for small wind turbines shall be thirty (30) feet.
c. The tower height shall be limited to 120 feet.
d. No tower is permitted that requires any lighting except under federal, state or local law.
e. There shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet between the ground and the lowest point of the rotor
blade. No blades may extend over parking areas, driveways, sidewalks or right-of-way.
f. Unauthorized access to the tower shall be prevented by design with a minimum of twelve (12) feet
from the ground to the bottom of the ladder. All doors to small wind turbine towers and electrical
equipment shall be locked.
g. No part of the small wind turbine structure, including guy wire anchors, may extend within ten feet
of the property boundaries of the installation site.
h. Small wind turbines shall be set back, a distance equal to the total height of the wind turbine from
the natural grade of the ground supporting the pad to the tip of the blade in the vertical position
measured along the vertical axis of the tower, from existing inhabited structures, overhead utility
lines, and public roads or rights-of-way. The setback zone can fall within the limits of the Flood
Hazard Overlay District.
i. All wiring from the tower to the residence shall be underground.
j. All small wind turbines shall be equipped with manual (electronic or mechanical) and automatic
overspeed controls to limit the blade rotation speed to within the design limit of the residential
wind energy system.
k. In all residential districts the maximum decibel level at the property line shall be sixty-five (65)
decibels.
4. Appearance. The distributed (small) wind turbine and tower shall have a flat finish as applied by
the manufacturer. The objective is to have the equipment as inconspicuous as practicable.
197
22:433
5. Application Information. All building applications shall include the following:
a. A site plan showing:
(i) Property lines and physical dimensions of the subject property within two times the total
height from the tower location;

the state of Oklahoma.
d. Tower blueprint or drawing signed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the state of
Oklahoma.
e. Prior to the issuance of a Certificate or Completion, built to plans shall be submitted to the City
signed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the state of Oklahoma.
6. Maintenance. The applicant shall maintain the distributed (small) wind turbine and related
equipment in good condition, and shall provide a written report of inspection and maintenance every two
years to the building official who will provide a form for the report. The report shall be signed by the
original installer of the system or someone of equivalent qualifications.
7. Insurance. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for the installation of a distributed (small)
wind turbine, the applicant shall provide the building official with evidence that the homeowners
insurance policy has been endorsed to cover damage or injury that might result from the installation and
operation of the small wind turbine system.
8. Removal. If a distributed (small) wind turbine becomes inoperable and is not put back into service
within six months, the property owner shall remove the small wind turbine, tower, and other related
equipment.

22:433.1  22:434.1
SEC. 433.1 - USES PERMISSIBLE ON REVIEW (Deleted as part of the action creating Special Use,
Section 434.1 - Ordinance No. O-9596-11, October 24, 1995)
SEC. 434.1 - SPECIAL USES
(As established by Ord. No. O-9596-11  October 24, 1995)
Any use designated as a "Special Use" under any zoning district is not appropriate for each and every
parcel of land which is included in the pertinent zoning district. However, upon review, the City Council
may determine that one or more "Special Uses" should be approved for a specific parcel of land. Such
approval, by ordinance duly adopted by the City Council, may come after a public notice and a hearing by
the Planning Commission. Any such approval may be made conditional on the subject parcel of land
meeting and maintaining specific requirements and/or conditions.
(a) Application and Fee: Application for a "Special Use" shall be filed with the Director of
Planning and Community Development. The application shall include the following:
(1) Name and address of the owner, and also applicant if different from the owner. (The
City of Norman may initiate the application.)
(2) Address and legal description of the property.
(3) If the applicant is not the legal owner of the property, a statement that the applicant is
either the authorized agent for the owner of the property or has a lawful right to
acquire use and possession of the property.
(4) A statement describing the nature and operating characteristics of the proposed
"Special Use(s)". For uses potentially generating high volumes of vehicular traffic, the
Director may require specific information relative to the anticipated peak loads and
peak use periods, the ability of the use to meet performance standards, or
substantiating the adequacy of proposed parking, loading, and circulation facilities.
(5) A site plan, drawn to scale, showing the location and dimensions of boundary lines,
with distances and bearings, easements, required yards and setbacks, and all existing
and proposed buildings, parking and loading areas, ingress and egress, the location of
existing and proposed landscaped areas, utility or service areas, fencing and screening,
signs and lighting.
(6) Application for a "Special Use" and for Rezoning for the same property may be made
concurrently, subject to the fees applicable to both a "Special Use" and a Rezoning.
The Planning Commission shall hold the public hearing on the Rezoning and the
"Special Use" at the same meeting and may combine the two hearings. If the City
Council modifies a recommendation of the Commission on a concurrent zoning
reclassification, the "Special Use" application may, if the City Council deems it
necessary, be referred back to the Planning Commission in the same manner as a new
application; provided, however, that no additional fee shall be required.
(7) A filing fee of $400.00 plus $10.00 per acre.
199
22:434.1
(8) In order to properly evaluate the proposed "Special Use", the Planning Director may
require the following additional information:
[a] Preliminary building elevations for all new or renovated structures, indicating
height, bulk, and general appearance.
[b] Preliminary improvement plans for any alteration of existing water courses or
drainage features, proposed streets and alleys, and the location of the 100 year
floodplain.
[c] The relationship of the site and the proposed use to surrounding uses, including
pedestrian and vehicular circulation, current use of nearby parcels, and any
proposed off-site improvements to be made.
(b) Review and Evaluation Criteria: The Planning Commission shall review and evaluate any
"Special Use" proposal and recommend to the City Council using the following criteria:
(1) Conformance with applicable regulations and standards established by the Zoning
Regulations.
(2) Compatibility with existing or permitted uses on abutting sites, in terms of building
height, bulk and scale, setbacks and open spaces, landscaping and site development,
and access and circulation features.
(3) Potentially unfavorable effects or impacts on other existing or permitted uses on
abutting sites, to the extent such impacts exceed those which reasonably may result
from use of the site by a permitted use. (NOTE: Throughout this Section, "Permitted
Use" means any use authorized as a matter of right under the applicable zoning
district.)
(4) Modifications to the site plan which would result in increased compatibility, or would
mitigate potentially unfavorable impacts, or would be necessary to conform to
applicable regulations and standards and to protect the public health, safety, morals,
and general welfare.
(5) Safety and convenience of vehicular and pedestrian circulation in the vicinity,
including traffic reasonably expected to be generated by the proposed "Special Use"
and other uses authorized and anticipated in the area, considering existing zoning and
land uses in the area.
(6) That any conditions applicable to approval are the minimum necessary to minimize
potentially unfavorable impacts on nearby uses and to ensure compatibility of the
proposed "Special Use" with existing or permitted uses in the surrounding area.
200
22:434.1
(c) Planning Commission Hearing and Recommendation: The Planning Commission shall hold
a public hearing on each application for a "Special Use". Public notification requirements
shall be the same as a rezoning procedure. At the public hearing, the Commission shall
review the application and shall receive public comments concerning the proposed use and
the proposed conditions under which it would be operated or maintained. The Planning
Commission may recommend that the City Council establish conditions of approval.
Conditions may include, but shall not be limited to, requirements for special yards, open
spaces, buffers, fences, walls, and screening; requirements for installation and maintenance
of landscaping and erosion control measures; requirements for street improvements and
dedications, regulation of vehicular ingress and egress, and traffic circulation, regulation of
signs; regulation of hours or other characteristics of operation; and such other conditions as
the Commission may deem necessary to insure compatibility with surrounding uses, and to
preserve the public health, safety, and welfare.
(d) City Council Approval: Granting a "Special Use" shall be considered a privilege bestowed
by the City Council for a specific use at a specific location. "Special Uses" may be granted
by the City Council with such requirements and/or conditions, as the Council deems
appropriate. Such requirements and/or conditions shall be continually complied with by the
applicant and his successors and assigns. At the time of issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy for the initial operation of a "Special Use", the City shall cause the property legal
description and "Conditions of Approval" established by the City Council to be filed in the
Tract Index of the Cleveland County Clerk's office. Prior to such filing, the Applicant shall
be afforded an opportunity to review the instrument to be filed, for correctness.
(e) Violations: For any reason, if any requirement or condition specified in the authorizing
"Special Use" ordinance is violated, said violation constitutes a violation of the Zoning
Ordinance and subjects the violator to the fines and penalties contained herein. Further, such
a violation constitutes grounds for the City Council to remove or amend, by ordinance, the
previously authorized "Special Use" and any concurrent rezoning.
(1) If it is determined by the Planning Director or the City Manager that there is a
violation of any applicable provision of this Section, or a failure to comply with
conditions imposed by any "Special Use" ordinance on the property, then the Planning
Director or the City Manager may initiate any or all of the following actions to
remedy the situation, including:
[a] Specify the nature and extent of any such violations and specify reasonable
time to correct such violations;
[b] Report such violations to the Code Enforcement Official and initiate action in
the same manner as any other violation of the Zoning Ordinance;
[c] Schedule a Public Hearing before the City Council to review such matter and
consider revocation, by ordinance, of the granting of a "Special Use" for said
property.
201
22:434.1
(2) Whenever any one or more of the foregoing actions is initiated, notice shall be given
to the property owner of record by any means then authorized by the Oklahoma
Pleading Code for service of summons in a civil action. Further, if the property is
occupied, such notice shall also be given, by first-class mail or hand-delivery,
addressed to "Tenant, Owner, or Manager" at the property address.
(f) Expiration for Non-Use: The authority to issue initial construction or initial occupancy
permits pursuant to the granting of a "Special Use" shall expire two (2) years after the City
Council approves the "Special Use", unless the City Council includes a different time limit as
a specific condition of approval. This time period to initially establish a "Special Use" may
be extended for a maximum of an additional two years by action of the City Council, upon
receipt of a timely request from the owner of said property, when it determines that
conditions have not substantially changed since the time of original approval.
In any case where the "Special Use" is not activated in accordance with the times specified in
the preceding paragraph, or where the "Special Use" has been discontinued for two
continuous years, then authority for such a "Special Use" ceases to exist and the owner must
reapply in order to establish or re-establish said "Special Use."
(g) Change of Ownership: A "Special Use" may be transferred to a new owner provided: (1)
written notification is sent to the Planning Director indicating date of transfer, name and
address of new owner, and a statement acknowledging any conditions attached to the
"Special Use" and the intent to continuously comply; (2) a $100.00 Transfer Fee is paid; and
(3) an inspection of the property reveals continued compliance with all original conditions.
(h) "Special Uses" which were formerly described as Uses Permitted on Review or Conditional
Use Permits:
(1) A use legally established pursuant to a Conditional Use Permit or Permissive Use
Rezoning prior to the date of adoption of these Zoning Regulations shall be deemed
pre-existing and, shall be permitted to continue, provided that it is operated and
maintained in accord with any conditions prescribed at the time of its establishment.
If such a structure is destroyed by fire, explosions, or act of God, it may be rebuilt, if
compliance with all conditions stipulated in its enabling ordinance are complied with.
(2) Expansion of a pre-existing Permissive Use or Conditional Use Permit shall be
permitted only upon the granting of a "Special Use" as prescribed in these regulations.

SEC. 435.1 -- PORTABLE STORAGE CONTAINERS AND ROLL-OFF TRASH CONTAINERS
(As established by Ord. No. O-0809-21  December 23, 2008)
1. Applicability
The provisions of this section shall apply to the location and duration of use of portable storage
containers and roll-off trash containers on any property within the City of Norman.
2. Definitions
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section. Where terms are not defined in this section, and are defined in
other adopted ordinances, such terms shall have the meaning as ascribed to them as in those
ordinances. Where terms are not defined through the methods authorized by this section, such
terms shall have ordinarily accepted meanings as the context implies.
(a) Portable storage container means any self-supporting metal container, usually metal or
metal-framed, designed and used for the storage of personal or business property of a nonhazardous
nature which is typically rented or leased to owners or occupants of property for
their temporary use and which is typically delivered and removed by truck.
(b) Roll-off trash container means a large metal container designed and used for the temporary
storage of refuse, rubbish, trash, garbage, junk, debris, offal, or any material rejected as
useless and fit only to be thrown away. Such container is typically rented or leased to
owners or occupants of property for their temporary use and which is typically delivered
and removed by truck. This term shall not be interpreted to refer to a trash container or
dumpster that is stored in a more permanent manner on the property, and is referenced or
regulated by the Engineering Design Criteria, and further is required to be screened from
public view. This term shall not be interpreted to include recycling facilities.
3. Condition and Maintenance
All portable storage containers and roll-off trash containers shall be delivered and maintained in
good condition, free from rodents, insects, graffiti, vulgar and/or pornographic words or pictures.
It shall be the responsibility of the property owner or occupant and the supplying company to
maintain the portable storage containers or roll-off trash containers in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
4. Placement and Duration of Use
(a) TEMPORARY On all property zoned or used for residential, commercial, or industrial
purposes, storage containers or roll-off trash containers may remain in use only so long as
a valid building or trade permit is in place for the property on which the container is
placed. No separate permit is required so long as the use is indicated on the approved site
plan or building permit for the project. When no building permit is in effect, a roll-off
container may not be placed on a lot for more than thirty (30) days unless authorized in
writing by the Director of Planning or his designee. In residentially zoned areas, the
container must be placed on the driveway or other approved pavement, and may not extend
into the public right-of-way. Should existing site conditions not allow for the placement of
a portable storage container in full compliance with these provisions, exceptions may be
considered and written approval granted on a case by case basis by the Director of
Planning or his designee, after consultation with the Public Works Director and the Fire
Marshall.
207
22:435.1
(b) SEASONAL Metal storage containers may be temporarily located on property that is
zoned for commercial or industrial use for no more than three (3) months within the same
calendar year, provided that a building permit is issued for each such container.
Containers cannot be vertically stacked, and should not be placed in front of the principle
structure, but must be located at the side or rear of the structure to minimize any visual
impact from abutting streets. As a temporary use, they may occupy no more than ten
percent of the required parking for the on-site principal use.
(c) PERMANENT Storage containers may be permanently located on property zoned or used
for industrial purposes provided that a building permit is issued for the container, which
must be properly anchored or tied down to resist lateral movement or overturning. If over
400 square feet, containers must be placed on a permanent foundation. Containers may
not be permanently located in areas that are zoned commercial. Containers may not be
placed in front of the principle structure, must observe all required setbacks, and may not
be placed within any right-of-way, utility easement, or required landscape area. In
industrial areas, such containers are exempt from the requirement to be clad in masonry
material, but must be located at the side or rear of the lot, and painted in a muted color that
complements the principle structure on the lot. If the lot is not already screened from
abutting residential uses, opaque screening must be installed to at least screen the container
from abutting residential use. Signs relating to the on-site business may not be
permanently or temporarily attached to any container that will be permanently located on a
site.
(d) RESIDENTIAL In areas which are residentially zoned, when no building or trade permit
is in effect for the property, a portable storage container may be placed on the driveway or
other approved pavement for a period not to exceed 14 days, provided that the container is
not located within any public right-of-way and does not block any public sidewalk. The
Planning Director, or his designee, may grant one 14 day extension, for good cause, when
requested in writing. A container may not be placed on the same property more than three
non-consecutive times in a one-year period. Failure to remove a container after the initial
14 day period, unless extended, may result in charges filed by the city for failure to comply
with this section. Such containers may not be permanently located in areas that are
residentially zoned.
(e) NON-CONFORMING USES Any portable on demand storage unit in existence as of the
effective date of this ordinance which is in violation hereof shall be deemed a nonconforming
use. Such non-conforming uses shall not in any manner be enlarged,
extended, or altered except that such uses may be changed so as to comply with the
provisions of this ordinance. Such uses as are deemed non-conforming uses pursuant to
the terms of this ordinance shall be permitted to continue for five (5) years after the
adoption of this ordinance, unless such use is terminated for any reason whatsoever prior
thereto for a period of thirty (30) days or more, thereafter such non-conforming use shall
terminate or come into compliance with the terms of this Section.

SEC. 436.1 - SALES PROHIBITED FROM RESIDENCES OR GARAGES
It shall be unlawful to sell, offer for sale, or otherwise place up for sale to the public any goods, wares or
merchandise from any residence or garage appurtenant thereto except as might otherwise be permitted by
this ordinance. Provided, however, owners and possessors of the property from which said sales might be
conducted shall be permitted to sell, offer for sale and to place up for sale goods, wares and merchandise
owned by them for a period of no less than six (6) months, provided further, however, that in no event shall
any goods, wares or merchandise purchased by the owners, or possessor of said premises, or by others, for
resale to the public be sold, offered for sale or otherwise placed up for sale from said premises. (O-2085, §
1)
SEC. 438.1 - HOME OCCUPATIONS
(Amended by O-1819-17  December 11, 2018)
The standards for home occupations in this chapter are intended to insure compatibility with other
permitted uses and with the residential character of the neighborhood, plus a clearly secondary or
incidental status in relation to the residential use of the main building as the criteria for determining
whether a proposed accessory use qualifies as a home occupation. (Cross reference Section 22:450,
Subparagraph 54)
(a) Home occupations are permitted accessory uses in residential districts only if all the following
conditions are observed:
(1) Such occupation shall be conducted solely by resident occupants in their residence and
no employees shall be permitted;
(2) No more than one room or twenty-five (25) per cent of the gross area of one floor of
said residence, whichever is less, shall be used for such purpose;
(3) No mechanical equipment is used or activity is conducted which creates any noise,
dust, odor, or electrical disturbance beyond the confines of the lot on which said
occupation is conducted;
(4) There shall be no sale or display of merchandise.
(5) There shall be no outside storage of any kind related to the home occupation;
(6) The use may increase vehicular traffic flow and parking by no more than one
additional vehicle at a time; and
(7) Only one sign may be allowed. The sign shall not exceed one (1) square foot in area,
shall be non-illuminated, and shall display only the name of the occupant and/or the
name of the home occupation.
(b) The following uses by the nature of the investment or operation have a tendency once started
to rapidly increase beyond the limits permitted for home occupations and thereby impair the
use and value of a residentially zoned area for residential purposes. Therefore, the uses
specified below shall not be permitted as home occupations: auto repair, major or minor;
barber shop; beauty shop; carpentry work; dance instruction; medical or dental offices;
painting of vehicles, trailers, or boats; private schools with organized classes; child care
establishment; radio or television repair; upholstering; restaurant; or rest home.
(c) Marijuana Establishments shall not be permitted as home occupations. (O-1819-17)

SEC. 438.2 - BED AND BREAKFAST ESTABLISHMENTS
(Established by Ord. No. O-9293-38 -- August 24, 1993; amended by O-0203-13  November 26, 2002)
All Bed and Breakfast establishments are considered accessory residential uses, and can only be
established by the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit. Section 434.1 outlines the procedural
requirements which govern all such applications.
There are two basic categories of Bed and Breakfast establishments, distinguished primarily by size.
TYPE I - is principally used as a single-family dwelling, with the provision of guest lodging a secondary
feature, and must conform to all the following conditions:
(1) May be permitted in any residential or agricultural zoning district.
(2) No more than four guest bedrooms may be provided.
(3) No individual cooking facilities may be installed in any guest room.
(4) Meal service is limited to resident guests only. Sale of food and beverages to other than
overnight guests is strictly prohibited.
(5) The owner shall reside on-premise.
(6) One parking space shall be provided for the owner, plus two spaces for each three rooms, or
fraction thereof, that serve as guests bedrooms. If overflow parking cannot be accommodated
on-street, additional on-site parking may be considered. (O-0203-13)
(7) To the extent feasible, parking should be located to the side or rear of the structure. When
front yard parking is used, no more than 40% of the required front yard be hard surfaced for
parking. All new parking areas are required to provide full retention of storm water.
(8) Any proposed additions must be compatible with the architectural style and building materials
of the dwelling. Additions which do not comply with the applicable setback requirements may
not be submitted to the Board of Adjustment as a request for a Variance.
(9) A landscaping and screening plan must be submitted which enhances the appearance of the site
by reducing or screening all parking areas to minimize their visual intrusion on abutting
properties. No lighting or signage may be installed which has not been reviewed as part of the
proposed development plan. Low wattage or low intensity light fixtures are preferred.
TYPE II - also serves as a residence, but because of the increased number of guest rooms and additional
parking this category of use is not appropriate in all residential districts. The following conditions must be
observed:
(1) May only be permitted in multi-family dwelling districts, specifically RM-2, RM-6, R-3, or
RO.
(2) One guest room may be permitted for each 2,000 square feet of lot area, up to a maximum of
eight guest rooms.
(3) No individual cooking facilities may be installed in any guest room.
(4) Meal service is limited to resident guests only. Sale of food and beverages to other than
overnight guests is strictly prohibited.
(5) The owner shall reside on-premise.
(6) One parking space shall be provided for the owner, plus two spaces for each three rooms, or
fraction thereof, that serve as guests bedrooms. If overflow parking cannot be accommodated
on-street, additional on-site parking may be considered. (O-0203-13)
210
22:438.2 - 438.3
(7) To the extent feasible, parking should be located to the side or rear of the structure. When
front yard parking is used, no more than 40% of the required front yard be hard surfaced for
parking. All new parking areas are required to provide full retention of storm water.
(8) Any proposed additions must be compatible with the architectural style and building materials
of the dwelling. Additions which do not comply with the applicable setback requirements may
not be submitted to the Board of Adjustment as a request for a Variance.
(9) A landscaping and screening plan must be submitted which enhances the appearance of the site
by reducing or screening all parking areas to minimize their visual intrusion on abutting
properties. No lighting or signage may be installed which has not been reviewed as part of the
proposed development plan. Low wattage or low intensity light fixtures are preferred.
SEC 438.3. CHILD CARE ESTABLISHMENTS.
(As amended by Ord. No. O-9596-19  December 12, 1995)
(a) A Family Day Care Home is an accessory use allowed by right in any agricultural or
residential zoning district. A maximum of seven children is allowed, which includes the
resident caregiver's own preschool children under five years of age. Employees other than
resident family members are not allowed. Such uses must be operated so as not to be intrusive
to their neighbors. The play yard should be completely enclosed by a six foot tall, opaque,
fence. While hours of operation are not prescribed, the use is intended to provide part-time
care for children. Such uses must maintain a license issued by the Department of Human
Services. (O-9596-19)
(b) Child Care Centers are allowed as a Special Use that may be granted in any of the multi-family
zoning districts. They must be operated as an accessory use in the operator's home, and may
contain a maximum of twelve (12) children. As a Special Use, the City may impose conditions
on the amount of parking, the hours of operation, the number of employees, the type of fencing
and screening, or any other aspect that could impact the surrounding neighborhood. (O-9596-
19)
(c) A Child Care Center of any size could be granted as a Special Use if operated as an accessory
use in conjunction with an institutional use, such as a church or school. (O-9596-19)
(d) Larger Child Care Centers that are not operated in conjunction with an institutional use are
allowed by right in any of the commercial zoning districts. A State license is required for any
Child Care Center. (O-9596-19)

22:439.1
SEC. 439.1 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT USES
(As established by Ord. No. O-8788-8 -- October 13, 1987)
In order for any of the following uses to locate, relocate, remodel, alter or rebuild, it shall be necessary to
first obtain zoning as a use permitted only upon review of the Planning Commission and City Council.
(a) Purpose: It has become apparent that the concentration of "adult entertainment uses" in the
City of Norman tends to result in the blighting and deterioration of those areas subject to
such concentration. Accordingly, it is deemed necessary to regulate such uses in a manner
reasonably calculated to prevent the occurrence of such deleterious effects upon surrounding
properties.
(b) Development Regulations for Adult Entertainment Uses. Any person applying for rezoning
as a Use Permissible on Review in order to locate, remodel, alter, rebuild, or relocate any of
the above referenced uses within The City of Norman must show that said use will comply
with the following developmental criteria as well as all others contained within this Article
generally:
1. Adult Entertainment Uses as specified hereinabove shall be permitted to locate only in
the "C-2" and the "C-3" zoning districts, as Uses Permitted upon Review.
2. No such zoning shall be granted for any proposed location which is within a one
thousand foot (1000') radius of any other Adult Entertainment Use as specified
hereinabove.
3. No Adult Entertainment Use shall be allowed to locate within a five hundred foot
(500') radius of any church, public or private school (type which offers a compulsory
education curriculum) or public or private park. Nor shall any Adult Entertainment
Uses be allowed to locate within five hundred feet of any area zoned for residential
use.
4. All distances required to be met pursuant to the terms of this section shall begin at the
property line of the proposed use and are measured to the nearest property line of the
public or private lot, school, park, church, residentially zoned lot, or adult
entertainment use within the proscribed distance, if any.
(c) Non-Conforming Uses. Any business in existence as of the effective date of this ordinance
which is in violation hereof shall be deemed a non-conforming use. Such non-conforming
uses shall not in any manner be enlarged, extended, altered or rebuilt except that such uses
may be changed so as to comply with the provisions of this ordinance.
Such uses as are deemed non-conforming uses pursuant to the terms of this ordinance shall
be permitted to continue for three (3) years after the adoption of this ordinance, unless such
use is terminated for any reason whatsoever prior thereto for a period of thirty (30) days or
more, thereafter such non-conforming use shall terminate or come into compliance with the
terms of this section.
(d) First Use Deemed Complying. In the event that any two or more "Adult Entertainment Uses"
are located within one thousand feet (1000') of each other as of the effective date of this
ordinance, that "Adult Entertainment Use" which shall have first been licensed or continually
operated shall be deemed to be the complying use. The person, firm, corporation or other
entity responsible for the operation or management of the "Adult Entertainment Use" in such
cases shall have the responsibility of proving to the Director of the Planning Department or
his designated representative by documented evidence the date on which such "Adult
Entertainment Use" was first licensed or began continuous operation.

unlawful for an owner to permit or do the following: Change the use of land or structure; erect, alter or
move any structure; install or modify any impervious area, such as a driveway, drive approach, patio,
tennis court, sidewalk, or similar permanent improvement until the building inspector has issued a building
permit certifying that the plans and intended use of land, buildings, and structures are in conformity with
this Ordinance. Provided, however, that non-structural alteration or repair of a building not to exceed
$500.00 in total cost may be made without obtaining a building permit; and further provided that no
building permit shall be required for the replacement or repair of conforming uses destroyed by fire or an
Act of God if the replacement is identical in use and coverage with that part of the structure destroyed. (O-
0405-30)
1. Application: The building inspector may require every applicant for a building permit to furnish

including any existing gravel areas, with a calculation of the percentage of existing and
proposed impervious surfaces, including buildings.
(d) Such other information with regard to the lot and neighboring lots and their use as may be
necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of these regulations. (Ord. 884,

22, 2014; O-1920-44  July 23, 2020; O-1920-51  July 23, 2020)
1. Establishment of a Board of Adjustment and Proceedings Thereof.
A Board of Adjustment and rules for the conduct of proceedings are hereby established as provided
in Chapter 4 of this Code.
2. Duties of an Administrative Official, Board of Adjustment, City Council, and Courts on Matters of
Appeal. It is the intent of this ordinance that all questions of interpretation and enforcement shall
be first presented to an administrative official, and that such questions shall be presented to the
Board of Adjustment only on appeal from the decision of an administrative official, and that
recourse from the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be by appeal to the District Court as
herein provided.
It is further intent of this ordinance that the duties of the City Council in connection with this
ordinance shall not include hearing and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that
may arise. The procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in this section and this
ordinance. Under this ordinance, the City Council shall have only the duties of: (1) Considering,
adopting, or rejecting proposed amendments, or repealing this ordinance, as provided by law, and
(2) establishing a schedule of fees for appeals hereunder for building permits and all other
expenses connected with the enforcement of this ordinance.
3. Powers. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
(a) Upon proper application, to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this ordinance or any other ordinance adopted pursuant thereto.
(b) Upon proper application to hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this
ordinance as hereinafter enumerated in sub-section 7 of this section and as enumerated in
Chapter 18 of the Code.
(c) Upon proper application, to hear and authorize in specific cases such variances from the
terms of this ordinance as are allowed under sub-section 10 of this section.
4. Decisions of the Board of Adjustment. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board of
Adjustment shall reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, shall modify the order, requirement, decision,
or determination appealed from, shall make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as
ought to be made, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this ordinance, and to
that end shall have the powers of an administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.
The concurring vote of three (3) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the administrative official, to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance, or to effect any
variation in the application of this ordinance.
215
22:441
5. Appeals from the Board of Adjustment. Any person or persons, board, taxpayer, department, or
bureau of the city aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may within ten (10) days
after the meeting wherein such decision was reached, seek review by the District Court and also by
filing a copy with the City Clerk and with the Chairman of the Board of Adjustment, a notice of
appeal, which said notice shall specify in detail the grounds of such appeal. Upon filing of the
notice of appeal, as herein provided, said board shall forthwith cause to be transmitted to the Court
Clerk of the District Court the original, or certified copies, of all the papers constituting the record
in the case, together with the order, decision, or ruling of the board. Said case shall be heard and
tried de novo in the District Court as in all other civil actions. Failure to file an appeal shall mean
the Board's action is considered final. (O-9192-48; O-0506-35)
An appeal to the District Court from the Board of Adjustment stays all proceedings and the action
appealed from unless the Chairman of the Board of Adjustment, from which the appeal is taken,
certifies to the Court Clerk after the notice of appeal has been filed, that by reason of fact stated in
the certificate a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the
District Court upon application or notice to an administrative official in charge of the enforcement
of the terms and provisions of this ordinance, upon notice to the Chairman of the Board of
Adjustment from which the appeal is taken, and upon due cause being shown the court may reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify, the decision brought up for review.
6. Procedure for Appeal of the Decision of an Administrative Official to the Board of Adjustment.
Appeals may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any person aggrieved or by any officer or
bureau of the governing body of said city affected by any decision of an administrative official
concerning interpretation or administration of this ordinance. Such appeals shall be taken within a
reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, by filing with an administrative official and with
the Board of Adjustment, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. In addition, such
person shall deposit with the Planning Department a fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) to
cover the cost and expense of appeal to the Board of Adjustment. (O-0506-35)
An administrative official shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal give public notice
thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and shall decide the same within a
reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. (O-9394-
19)
An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless an administrative
official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of
appeal is filed with him, that by reason of fact stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion,
cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than
by restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of competent
jurisdiction upon application, upon notice to an administrative official from whom the appeal is
taken, and upon due cause being shown.
216
22:441
7. Special Exceptions Defined and Enumerated. A special exception is defined as follows: "A
special exception is a use that would not be appropriate generally or without restriction throughout
the zoning district but which if controlled as to number, area, location, or relation to the
neighborhood, would promote the public health, safety, welfare, morals, order, comfort,
convenience, appearance, prosperity, or general welfare. Such uses may be permitted in such
zoning districts as special exceptions if specific provision for such special exceptions is made
hereafter."
The Board of Adjustment is hereby empowered and authorized to grant the following specific
exceptions, to wit:
(a) To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot in
single ownership as shown of record;
(b) To interpret the provisions of the ordinance where the street layout actually on the ground
varies from the street layout as shown on the map fixing the several districts, which map is
attached to and made a part of this ordinance;
(c) To grant exceptions to the off-street parking requirements as set forth in Article XII,
Section 431.5-431.7, when it is determined that the size and shape of the lot to be built on
is such that off-street parking provisions could not be complied with, that the proposed use
of land is similar in nature to adjacent land uses, and that the proposed use will not create
undue traffic congestion in the adjacent streets;
(d) To permit new structures and substantial improvements to be erected in the designated
floodway of the Flood Hazard District on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level
when (1) good and sufficient cause is shown, (2) it is determined that the exception is the
minimum necessary (considering the flood hazard) to afford relief, and (3) that the
granting of the exception will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing ordinances.
(e) To allow the continued use of a legal non-conforming gravel driveway and/or parking area
within the Central Core Area (as defined) when it can be determined that both of the
following conditions are met (1) the parking area has existed since July 1966, and (2) the
owner has agreed to install permanent or semi-permanent borders to aid in visually
verifying the actual extent of usage. (O-0405-30)
(f) To permit a mobile home to serve as a temporary second dwelling to relieve a medical
hardship. The application must include a doctors statement indicating that the patient is in
need of the care of his or her family. The mobile home must meet all City of Norman
Building Code requirements and State of Oklahoma requirements for septic systems. The
Exception can be approved for up to 3 years on any lot that is five acres or greater in the
A-2 zoning district. The Exception can be renewed every 3 years by filing an application
for an administrative extension, including a new doctors statement. Only two (2)
administrative extensions may be granted. If a third extension is needed, a new application
will be required for Board of Adjustment review. Once the need for the mobile home no
longer exists, the mobile home must be removed. (O-1314-15; O-1920-44)
217
22:441
(g) To allow the construction and maintenance of Residential Carports, as set forth in Article
XII, Section 431.10. (O-1920-51)
8. Procedure for Application for Special Exceptions. Applications may be taken to the Board of
Adjustment for special exceptions to this ordinance, above-defined and enumerated in sub-section
7, by any person aggrieved or by any officer or bureau of the governing body of said city. A
special exception shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
(a) An applicant shall submit to the Board of Adjustment a written application for said special
exception indicating the section of this ordinance under which the special exception is sought,
and stating the grounds upon which it is requested. An application for a special exception to
the provisions of Chapter 18 of the code shall include the following plans and information:

design and construction materials of existing or proposed building on the lot, when
such information is pertinent to the application;
(7) Any additional information which the applicant feels may support the request.

owners of separate parcels or until a maximum radius of one thousand (1000) feet has been
reached. Said list shall be current and certified by a professional engineer, an attorney, a
registered surveyor, a bonded abstractor, or the County Assessor. Maps and forms to
accomplish the above requirement will be available at the City of Norman Planning

public interest;
(c) In granting any special exception, the Board of Adjustment shall prescribe the appropriate

10. Variance Defined. A variance is defined as follows: "A variance is a relaxation of the terms of the
zoning ordinance, when such variance will not be contrary to the public interest, and where, owing
to the conditions peculiar to the property and not the result of the actions of the applicant, a literal
enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary and undue hardship, as hereinafter
defined. As in this ordinance a variance is authorized for any development standard contained in
Chapter 22 of the Code except where a Special Exception is defined and enumerated in Section
441.7 of Chapter 22." (O-1314-15)
219
22:441
11. Procedure for Application for Variances. The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to
authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variances from the terms of this ordinance as will not
be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions would result in an unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this ordinance
shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
(a) An applicant shall submit to the Board of Adjustment a written application indicating:
(1) That special conditions and circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land,
structure, or building involved and are not applicable to other lands, structures, or
buildings in the same district;
(2) That the literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the
applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district
under the terms of this ordinance;
(3) That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the
applicant;
(4) That granting the variances requested will not confer on the applicant any special
privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structure, or buildings in
the same district;
No non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts
shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
(b) A fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) shall be paid to the City Clerk to cover the cost and
expense of the appeal to the Board of Adjustment; (Ord. No. O-0506-35)
(c) The applicant shall submit with each application a list of names and addresses of all record
property owners within a three hundred (300) foot radius of the exterior boundary of the
subject property, said radius to be extended by increments of one hundred (100) linear feet
until the list of property owners includes not less than fifteen (15) individual property
owners of separate parcels or until a maximum radius of one thousand (1000) feet has been
reached. Said list shall be current and certified by a professional engineer, an attorney, a
registered surveyor, a bonded abstractor, or the County Assessor. Maps and forms to
accomplish the above requirement will be available at the City of Norman Planning
Department; (O-8990-43; O-9091-10)
(d) Upon receipt of said written application, fee, and list, notice of public hearing before the
Board of Adjustment shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City of Norman not less than ten (10) days before the meeting of the board. In
addition, notice of public hearing shall be given by mailing written notice by the
Chairman of said board to all owners of property within a three hundred (300) foot or
larger radius of the exterior boundary of the subject property. Said notice shall contain:
220
22:441
(1) Legal description of the property and the street address or approximate location in
the City of Norman;
(2) Present zoning classification of the property and the nature of the variance
requested;
(3) Date, time, and place of hearing.
Said written notice shall be mailed not less than fifteen (15) days before the meeting of the
board. A copy of the published notice may be mailed in lieu of written notice. However,
no notice of hearing shall be required on hearings involving minor variances, and the board
shall set forth in its statement of policy what constitutes minor variances. Such minor
variance shall be approved by the City Council.
(e) A variance from the terms of Chapter 18 of this code shall not be granted by the Board of
Adjustment unless and until an applicant shall comply with all provisions of this section
and also indicate by written application that:
(1) There are special circumstances or conditions such as the existence of buildings,
topography, vegetation, sign structure or other matters on right-of-way, which
would substantially restrict the effectiveness of the sign in question; provided,
however, that such special circumstances or conditions must be peculiar to the
particular business or enterprise to which the applicant desired to draw attention
and do not apply generally to all business or enterprises.
(2) The variance would be in general harmony with the purposes of this code, and
specifically would not be injurious to the neighborhood in which the business or
enterprise to which the applicant desired to draw attention is located;
(3) The variance is the minimum one necessary to permit the applicant to reasonably
draw attention to his business or enterprise.
(f) A minor variance may be granted by the Board of Adjustment for an encroachment upon
any required building setback line when that encroachment represents approximately ten
(10) percent of the required yard, or involves only a minor portion of the structure.
(1) A minor variance may be granted only upon a finding by the Board of Adjustment
that the application of the ordinance to the particular property would create an
unnecessary hardship, that there are peculiar conditions of the property which
contributed to the encroachment, and relief, if granted, would not cause detriment
to the surrounding properties or the public good, or impair the purposes and intent
of the ordinance.
(2) A fee of three hundred ($300) dollars shall be paid to the Planning Department to
cover the cost and expense of the appeal to the Board of Adjustment. (O-0506-35)
221
22:441
(3) The applicant shall submit with each application an accurate list of names and
addresses of all record property owners adjacent to, or directly across the street,
from the subject property. Notice, by certified mail, shall be mailed not less than
ten (10) days before the meeting of the Board, and shall contain the facts listed in
subsection 11(d) of this section. (O-9192-48)
12. Hearing of the Board of Adjustment on a Variance. The public hearing shall be held in accordance
with the following provisions:
(a) At said hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney;
(b) The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that the requirements of sub-section 11(a)
hereinabove have been met by the applicant for variance;
(c) The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the reason set forth in the
application justifies the granting of the variance and that the variance is the minimum
variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, structure, or building;
(d) The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance will
be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this ordinance, will not be injurious to the
neighborhood, or will not be otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
(e) The Board of Adjustment, in granting any variance, shall prescribe appropriate conditions
and safeguards in conformity with this ordinance. Violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be
deemed a violation of this ordinance and shall be punishable under the penalty section of
this ordinance;
(f) The Board of Adjustment shall under no circumstances grant a variance to allow a use not
permissible under the applicable terms of this ordinance or other general ordinance of said
city with respect to the use district concerned, nor shall the Board of Adjustment hear or
decide upon any matters that could be determined by regular zoning procedures before the
Planning Commission and City Council of the City of Norman; nor grant any variance by
reason of the existence of non-conforming uses in the district concerned or in adjoining
districts;
(g) For the purposes of this ordinance the term "hardship" shall be interpreted to mean a
hardship peculiar to the property of the applicant that is of such a degree of severity that its
imposition is not necessary to carry out the spirit of the zoning ordinance and that would
amount to substantial and unnecessary waste of the property;
(h) The Board of Adjustment shall not have the authority to grant any variance which would
increase the maximum permitted sign area on a single lot or building as specified in this
code, or to allow any sign classified as a prohibited sign as specified in Section 18-402 of
the code.
222
22:441
13. Provisions of Ordinance Declared to be Minimum Requirements. The provisions of this
ordinance, in their interpretation and application, shall be held to be minimum requirements
adopted for the promotion of public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Wherever the
requirements of this ordinance are at variance with the requirements of any of the lawfully adopted
rules, regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions, or covenants, the most restrictive or that imposing
the higher standard shall govern.

APPENDIX F
PLANT LIST
Section A outlines plant species that DO NOT MEET cultural characteristic requirements of Normans
climate and soil composition for trees and shrubs to thrive.
Section B outlines selected sustainable species that DO MEET cultural characteristic requirements for
Normans climate. Species other than listed within this list may be acceptable for use in the landscape and
will be considered if the species tolerates Normans climate and soils. Plant species must be listed on a
detailed landscape plan.
It is recommended that a variety of species, rather than just one or two species, be utilized in the landscape
to avoid a monoculture. Planting only one or two species can increase the probability of a plant population
encountering diseases and insect infestation.
In an effort to conserve water the City of Norman promotes utilization of drought tolerant and Oklahoma
Proven species to assure sustainable landscapes.
SECTION A: Plant species that DO NOT MEET the required cultural characteristics
suitable for Normans climate and landscaping requirements.
