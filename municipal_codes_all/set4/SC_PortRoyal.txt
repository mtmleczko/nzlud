PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Port Royal. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Port Royal, South Carolina Code, as supplemented through June 30, 1980 and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan N. Shekitka, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Philip Cromer, Town Manager and other members of the town government for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

(Code 1980, § 1-3) 
Sec. 1-4. - Catchlines, history notes and references. 
(a)  The catchlines of the sections and subsections of this Code are intended merely as catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections or subsections to which they relate, and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections or subsections, nor as any part of the section, nor unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted.

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code.

(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing sections or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Each day any violation of any provisions of this Code or of any such ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or order shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.

(c)  The penalties and punishments referred to above are the penalties and punishments for the violation of all provisions contained in this Code and for the violation of all amended ordinances or any new ordinances which may be legally enacted by the council, unless otherwise specifically provided, and except as otherwise provided by state law.

(b)  Any officer, agent or other person acting for or employed by any corporation or unincorporated association or organization shall be subject and liable to punishment as well as such corporation or unincorporated association or organization for the violation by it of any provision of this Code, where such violation was the act or omission, or the result of the act, omission or order of any such person. 
(Code 1980, § 1-9) 
Sec. 1-10. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code. 
(Code 1980, § 1-10)

No contract or purchase shall be subdivided to avoid the requirements of this division. All sales of personal property which has become obsolete or unusable, when the estimated value shall exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), shall be sold by formal written contract or at a public auction to the highest responsible bidder, after due notice inviting proposals and bidders.

(3)  Tabulation. A tabulation of all bids received shall be available for public inspection. 
(4)  Rejection of bids. The purchasing agent shall have the authority, with the consent of town council, to reject all bids, parts of all bids, or all bids for any one (1) or more supplies or contractual services included in the proposed contract, when the public interest will be served thereby. 
(5)  Bidders in default to town. The purchasing agent shall not accept the bid of a vendor or contractor who is delinquent in the payment of taxes, license or other moneys due the town. 
(6)  Award of contract. 
a.  Authority in agent. The purchasing agent shall have the authority to award contracts within the purview of this division; provided, however, contracts in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) shall not be awarded without prior approval of town council. 
b.  Lowest responsible bidder. Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. In determining "lowest responsible bidder," in addition to price, the purchasing agent shall consider: 
1.  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
2.  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
3.  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder; 
4.  The quality of performance of previous contracts or services; 
5.  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or services; 
6.  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service; 
7.  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or contractual services to the particular use required; 
8.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract; 
9.  The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid. 
(7)  Award to other than low bidder.

If local bidders are not involved in the tie bids, the purchasing agent shall award the contract to one (1) of the outside tie bidders by drawing lots in public. The purchasing agent, local bidders, and vendors should bear in mind, however, that to award a contract to a local vendor where he is not the lowest responsible bidder, or where price, quality and service are not equal, is to give preference to one (1) minute segment of the citizenry against the best interests of the community as a whole. 
(9)  Performance bonds. The purchasing agent shall have the authority to require a performance bond, before entering into a contract, in such form and amount as he shall find reasonably necessary to protect the best interest of the town. 
(10)  Payment bond/labor and material bond. The purchasing agent may require a payment bond and a labor and material bond, before entering into a contract, in such form and amount as he shall deem necessary to protect the best interest of the town.

Any wilful violation of this section shall constitute malfeasance in office, and any officer or employee of the town found guilty thereof shall thereby forfeit his office or position. Any violation of this section with the knowledge express or implied of the person contracting with the town shall render the contract voidable by the town manager or the town council. 
(Ord. No. 83-17, § 3, 6-8-83)

(Ord. No. 83-17, § 8, 6-8-83) 
Sec. 2-159. - Cooperative purchasing. 
    The purchasing agent shall have authority to join with other units of government in cooperative purchasing plans when the best interests of the town could be served thereby; provided that the purchasing agent of the town is given the authority to make purchases of supplies and equipment through the property division of the state budget and control board, without the formality of publication and receiving competitive bids.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL STANDARDS 

Sec. 9-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    Municipality. The legislature of the State of South Carolina has in SC Code of Laws, Title 5 and Title 6, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the town council of Port Royal, South Carolina does ordain the following. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-2. - Findings of fact. 
    The special flood hazard areas of Port Royal are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-3. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the ordinance from which this chapter is derived prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
    Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-4. - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Port Royal as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study, dated September 29, 1986 with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
    Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its flood insurance study for the unincorporated areas of Beaufort County, with accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-5. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-6. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-7. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions, shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-8. - Partial invalidity and severability. 
    If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the remainder of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall not be affected and shall remain in force. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-9. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of Port Royal or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-10. - Penalties for violation. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more that five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the town from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

    Executive Order 11988 (floodplain management) issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM, or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. 
    Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before April 13, 1977 (the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance). 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs). 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A.

    Flood-resistant material means any building material capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum seventy-two (72) hours) with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively after submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable flood-resistant materials.

    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of the structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: (a) listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; (b) certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; (c) individually listed on a state inventory of historic places; (d) individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified (1) by an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or (2) directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs. Some structures or districts listed on the state or local inventories may not be "historic" as cited above, but have been included on the inventories because it was believed that the structures or districts have the potential for meeting the "historic" structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced that the South Carolina Department of Archives and History has individually determined that the structure or district meets DOI historic structure criteria. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) means applies to all new and renewed flood insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged. 
    Limited storage means an area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant or breakaway material, void of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be temperature controlled. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in an A, AE and A1-A30 zone it must meet the requirements of section 9-41(4) of this chapter. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in a V, VE and V1-V30 zone it must meet the requirements of section 9-46 of this chapter. 
    Lowest adjacent grade (LAG) is an elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any of the exterior walls of a building or proposed building walls. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.

    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) means as corrected in 1929, elevation reference points set by National Geodetic Survey based on mean sea level. 
    New construction means structure for which the start of construction commenced after April 13, 1977 (the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance). The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structure. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs) is completed on or before April 13, 1977 (the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance). 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) means datum point established at Pointe-au-Père on the St. Lawrence River, Quebec Province, Canada, based on the mass or density of the earth. The datum listed as the reference datum on flood insurance rate maps should be used for elevation certificate and floodproofing certificate completion. 
    Primary frontal dune means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively steep slope to a relatively mild slope. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: (a) built on a single chassis; (b) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; (c) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and, (d) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Repetitive loss means a building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two (2) occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event. 
    Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 means The act provides that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances. 
    Start of construction means for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facility or infrastructure that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of "substantial improvement." 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions (does not include American with Disabilities Act compliance standards); or, 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
(3)  Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five (5) years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from a term or terms of this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these regulations.

(5)  Development proposals. Require development proposals for proposed developments prior to signing off on and CLOMRs or LOMRs. 
(6)  Adjoining floodplains. Cooperate with neighboring communities with respect to the management of adjoining floodplains and/or flood-related erosion areas in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards. 
(7 )  Notifying adjacent communities. Notify adjacent communities prior to permitting substantial commercial developments and large subdivisions to be undertaken in areas of special flood hazard and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
(8)  Certification requirements. 
a.  Obtain and review actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor of all new or substantially improved structures, in accordance with administrative procedures outlined in section 9-34(b)(2) or the coastal high hazard area requirements outlined in section 9-46(5). 
b.  Obtain the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with the floodproofing certification outlined in section 9-34(b)(1). 
c.  When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect in accordance with the non-residential construction requirements outlined in section 9-42(2). 
d.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in the coastal high hazard area requirements outlined in section 9-46(4), section 9-46(6), and section 9-46(8) of this chapter. 
(9)  Map interpretation. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article. 
(10)  Prevailing authority. Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations for flood protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, etc.) shall prevail. The correct information should be submitted to FEMA as per the map maintenance activity requirements outlined in section 9-42(7)b. 
(11)  Use of best available data. When base flood elevation data or floodway data has not been provided in accordance with section 9-4, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize best available base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, including data developed pursuant to the standards for subdivision proposals outlined in section 9-43(4), in order to administer the provisions of this chapter. Data from preliminary, draft, and final flood insurance studies constitutes best available data from a federal, state, or other source. Data must be developed using hydraulic models meeting the minimum requirement of NFIP approved model. If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Parts 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used. 
(12)  Special flood hazard area/topographic boundaries conflict. When the exact location of boundaries of the areas special flood hazards conflict with the current, natural topography information at the site the property owner may apply and be approved for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) by FEMA. The local administrator in the permit file will maintain a copy of the letter of map amendment issued from FEMA. 
(13)  On-site inspections. Make on-site inspections of projects in accordance with the administrative procedures outlined in section 9-46(d). 
(14)  Administrative notices. Serve notices of violations, issue stop-work orders, revoke permits and take corrective actions in accordance with the administrative procedures in section 9-46. 
(15)  Records maintenance. Maintain all records pertaining to the administration of this chapter and make these records available for public inspection.

Notify the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Land, Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance Program within six (6) months, of any annexations or detachments that include special flood hazard areas. The community must incorporate applicable maps from surrounding jurisdictions into this chapter within ninety (90) days of date of the annexation. 
(17)  Federally funded development. The President issued Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management May 1977. E.O. 11988 directs federal agencies to assert a leadership role in reducing flood losses and losses to environmental values served by floodplains. Proposed developments must go through an eight-step review process. Evidence of compliance with the executive order must be submitted as part of the permit review process. 
(18)  Substantial damage determination. Perform an assessment of damage from any origin to the structure using FEMA's Residential Substantial Damage Estimator (RSDE) software to determine if the damage equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(19)  Substantial improvement determinations. Perform an assessment of permit applications for improvements or repairs to be made to a building or structure that equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. Cost of work counted for determining if and when substantial improvement to a structure occurs shall be cumulative for a period of five (5) years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur. 
The market values shall be determined by one (1) of the following methods: 
a.  The current assessed building value as determined by the county's assessor's office or the value of an appraisal performed by a licensed appraiser at the expense of the owner; or 
b.  One (1) or more certified appraisals from a registered professional licensed appraiser in accordance with the laws of South Carolina. The appraisal shall indicate actual replacement value of the building or structure in its pre-improvement condition, less depreciation for functionality and obsolescence and site improvements.

Sec. 9-36. - Administrative procedures. 
(a)  Inspections of Work in Progress. As the work pursuant to a permit progresses, the local administrator shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this chapter, the administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor. 
(c)  Revocation of permits. The local administrator may revoke and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. 
(d)  Periodic inspections. The local administrator and each member of his/her inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(e)  Violations to be corrected. When the local administrator finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his/her duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property he owns. 
(f)  Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the administrator shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, that: 
(1)  The building or property is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance; 
(2)  A hearing will be held before the local administrator at a designated place and time, not later than ten (10) days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and 
(3)  Following the hearing, the local administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears appropriate. 
(g)  Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the administrator shall find that the building or development is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance, he/she shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such period, not less than sixty (60) days, the administrator may prescribe; provided that where the administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. 
(h)  Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice of appeal in writing to the administrator and the clerk within ten (10) days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
(i)  Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the discretion of the court. 
(j)  Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared in violation of this chapter and the violation is not remedied then the local administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate a section 1316 of the National Flood insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with the ordinance. Once a violation has been remedied the local administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the section 1316 be rescinded.

Secs. 9-37-9-40. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 9-41. - General standards. 
    Development may not occur in the floodplain where alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures cannot be located out of the floodplain and that encroachments onto the floodplain are minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
(2)  Flood resistant materials and equipment. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(3)  Minimize flood damage. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages. 
(4)  Critical development. Shall be elevated to the 500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year flood elevation data. 
(5)  Utilities. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This requirement does not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses, etc., as long as cut off devices and back flow devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to the building. 
(6)  Water supply systems. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(7)  Sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(8)  Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent floatation or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads. 
(9)  Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM development and structures. 
(10)  Non-conforming buildings or uses . Non-conforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Provided, however, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter. 
(11)  American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in section 9-42, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-42. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard (zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE) where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 9-4 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local administrator section 9-35, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in section 9-42(4). 
(2)  Non-Residential Construction. 
a.  New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in section 9-42(4). No basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. 
b.  A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in section 9-34(b)(2). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 9-54 of this chapter. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of section 9-54 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this chapter. Structures that are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The local administrator must approve the maintenance plan and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to it. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions for residential construction in section 9-42(1) of this chapter must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance with section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis at least thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the sight, reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength shall support the chassis. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height an engineering certification is required. 
d.  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator. 
(4)  Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet all of the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. If there are multiple enclosed areas, each area must have openings in its exterior walls; 
2.  The bottom of each opening must be no more than one (1) foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening; 
3.  Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area; 
4.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; 
5.  Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one (1) side of the building. 
b.  Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five (5) feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized. 
c.  Enclosures below BFE. 
1.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
2.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except to enclose a single storage area and must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
3.  One (1) wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in sections 9-42(1), (2) and (3). 
4.  All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in sections 9-42(1), (2) and (3) should be of flood resistant materials. 
(5)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 9-4, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local administrator. 
b.  If section 9-42(5)a is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV. 
c.  Stream crossings for any purpose (i.e. timber harvesting operations), if temporary, shall be permitted in accordance with floodway requirements of section 9-42(5) and the temporary development provisions of section 9-42(11). Otherwise, the development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV. 
d.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of section 9-42(3) are met. 
e.  Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the floodway configuration. 
(6)  Recreational vehicles. 
a.  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is: 
1.  On wheels or jacking system; 
2.  Attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices; and 
3.  Has no permanently attached additions. 
b.  Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be: 
1.  On-site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; and 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the development permit and certification requirements of section 9-34, general standards outlined in section 9-41, and manufactured homes standards in section 9-42(3). 
(7)  Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures that flood maps, studies and other data identified in section 9-4 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data. The following map maintenance activities are identified: 
a.  Requirement to submit new technical data. 
1.  For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals include:

ii.  Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area; 
iii.  Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and 
iv.  Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with section 9-42(13)d. 
2.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data, required in accordance with section 9-42(7), prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall also be the responsibility of the applicant. 
3.  The floodplain administrator shall require a conditional letter of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for: 
i.  Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation; and 
ii.  Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by more than one (1) foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway. 
4.  Floodplain development permits issued by the floodplain administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to section 9-42(7). 
5.  Conditional letter of map revisions (CLOMR) and/or letters of map revision (LOMR) must go through the variance process outlined in Article V. 
b.  Right to submit new technical data. The floodplain administrator may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the local jurisdiction and may be submitted at any time. 
(8)  Accessory structures.

    Located within the areas of special flood hazard (zones A and V) established in section 9-4, are small streams where no base flood data has been provided or where no floodways have been identified. The following provisions apply within such areas: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within one hundred (100) feet of the stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If section 9-43(1) is satisfied and base flood elevation data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions of article IV and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established in accordance with section 9-35(11). 
(3)  Data from preliminary, draft, and final flood insurance studies constitutes best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical Bulletin 1-98 Use of Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Data as Available Data. If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used. 
(4)  When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal, state, or other source one (1) of the following methods may be used to determine a BFE. For further information regarding the methods for determining BFEs listed below, refer to FEMA's manual Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas: 
a.  Contour interpolation. 
1.  Superimpose approximate zone A boundaries onto a topographic map and estimate a BFE. 
2.  Add one-half of the contour interval of the topographic map that is used to the BFE. 
b.  Data extrapolation. A BFE can be determined if a site within five hundred (500) feet upstream of a reach of a stream reach for which a 100-year profile has been computed by detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope characteristics are relatively similar to the downstream reaches. 
c.  Hydrologic and hydraulic calculations. Perform hydrologic and hydraulic calculations to determine BFEs using FEMA approved methods and software. These methods include, but are not limited to the following: 
1.  HEC-RAS 3.1.1 and up; 
2.  HEC-1 4.0.1 and up; 
3.  HEC-2 4.6.2; 
4.  HEC-HMS 1.1 and up; 
5.  FLO-2D; 
6.  QUICK-2; 
7.  SFD; 
8.  WSPRO.

(6)  There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, thereby rendering the building free of obstruction prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. Only beach compatible sand may be used. The local administrator shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist that demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
a.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
b.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
c.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
(7)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes that would increase potential flood damage. 
(8)  Lattice work or decorative screening shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided they are not part of the structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are to be used and provided the following design specifications are met: 
a.  No solid walls shall be allowed. 
b.  Breakaway wall material shall consist of wood or mesh screening only. 
c.  Design safe loading resistance of each breakaway wall shall be not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot; or 
d.  If more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot, a registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design wall collapse would result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-structural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the IBC International Building Code. 
e.  Breakaway wall material shall be constructed with flood resistant materials. 
(9)  If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, such enclosed space shall not be designed to be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. 
a.  Only flood resistant materials shall be used below the required flood elevation specified in section 9-41(b). 
b.  One (1) wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in section 9-41(e). 
c.  The total area of an enclosed space shall not exceed two hundred ninety-nine (299) square feet per building. 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with lattice work or decorative screening, as provided for in sections 9-46(8) and (9). 
(11)  No manufactured homes shall be permitted except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and elevation standards of section 9-42(3). 
(12)  Recreational vehicles shall be permitted in coastal high hazard areas provided that they meet the recreational vehicle criteria of section 9-42(6) and the temporary structure provisions of section 9-42(11). 
(13)  Temporary structures are permitted in accordance with section 9-42(11). 
(14)  Accessory structures, below the required lowest floor elevation specified in section 9-46(2), are prohibited except for the following: 
a.  Swimming pools. 
1.  They are installed at-grade or elevated so long as the pool will not act as an obstruction. 
2.  They must be structurally independent of the building and its foundation. 
3.  They may be placed beneath a coastal building only if the top of the pool and any accompanying decking or walkway are flush with the existing grade and only if the lower area remains unenclosed. 
4.  As part of the certification process for V-zone buildings the design professional must consider the effects that any of these elements will have on the building in question and any nearby buildings. 
b.  Pool utility equipment rooms. If the building can not be built at or above the BFE, because of functionality of the equipment then a structure to house the utilities for the pool may be built below the BFE with the following provisions: 
1.  It must be structurally independent from the main structure. 
2.  It must be built with breakaway walls. 
3.  The utilities must be anchored to prevent flotation and shall be designed to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood. 
c.  Access stairs attached to or beneath an elevated building: 
1.  Must be constructed of flood-resistant materials. 
2.  Must be constructed as open staircases so they do not block flow under the structure in accordance with 44 CFR 60.3(e)(5). 
d.  Decks. 
1.  If the deck is structurally attached to a building then the bottom of the lowest horizontal member must be at or above the elevation of the buildings lowest horizontal member. 
2.  If the deck is to be built below the BFE then it must be structurally independent of the main building and must not cause an obstruction. 
3.  If an at-grade, structurally independent deck is proposed then a design professional must evaluate the design to determine if it will adversely affect the building and nearby buildings. 
e.  Elevators. 
1.  Install a float switch system or another system that provides the same level of safety is necessary for all elevators where there is a potential for the elevator cab to descend below the BFE during a flood per FEMA's Technical Bulletin 4-93 Elevator Installation for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
2.  All equipment that may have to be installed below the BFE such as counter weight roller guides, compensation cable and pulleys, and oil buffers for traction elevators and the jack assembly for a hydraulic elevator must be constructed using flood-resistant materials where possible per FEMA's Technical Bulletin 4-93 Elevator Installation for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
(15)  Parking areas should be located on a stable grade under or landward of a structure. Any parking surface shall consist of gravel or ROC aggregate. 
(16)  Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This requirement does not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses, etc., as long as cut off devices and back flow devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to the building. No utilities or components shall be attached to breakaway walls.

(2)  The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an existing building that is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials for the exterior and interior building components and elements below the base flood elevation. 
(3)  The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood velocities exceed five (5) feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls. 
(4)  The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of section 9-42(4) of this chapter. 
(5)  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation (BFE) so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section 9-41(e) of this chapter. 
(6)  The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of section 9-42(5) of this chapter. 
(7)  Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain in accordance with the temporary development provisions of section 9-42(11). 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-55. - Considerations.

(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(9)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and 
(10)  Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-56. - Findings. 
    Findings listed above shall be submitted to the appeal board, in writing, and included in the application for a variance. Additionally, comments from the department of natural resources, land, water and conservation division, state coordinator's office, must be taken into account and included in the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-57. - Floodways. 
    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In order to insure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the variance is granted the applicant must provide a bond for one hundred (100) percent of the cost to perform the development. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, 11-10-10) 
Sec. 9-58. - Conditions. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. The following conditions shall apply to all variances: 
(1)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Violations must be corrected in accordance with section 9-36(e) of this chapter.

Sec. 10-41. - Purposes and findings. 
(a)  The purposes of this article are: 
(1)  To provide minimum standards and regulations ensuring the safe shipment and transportation of radioactive materials into, within, through and out of the town. 
(2)  To regulate the transport of radioactive wastes through the town. 
(b)  The town council finds that: 
(1)  The increasing production of radioactive wastes and other radioactive materials has led to increased transportation of these wastes and materials and to increased occurrences of transportation accidents involving the release of radioactivity into the environment. 
(2)  There is currently no monitoring of many of these shipments enroute, by either federal or state officials, and the federal capabilities for enforcement of compliance with federal safety regulations are inadequate unless supplemented by state or local action. 
(3)  There is, therefore, a significant threat to public health and safety and to the environment presented by the shipment of radioactive wastes and other radioactive materials into, within, through, and out of the town. 
(4)  The capability of emergency preparedness and response by the town to radioactive materials release, by accident or otherwise, where significantly hazardous quantities are involved, within the limits of the town is currently and foreseeably inadequate in terms of recovery cost, equipment, personnel and evacuation and, thus, the presence within the town of radioactive substances is an unacceptable risk to the health and safety of its residents.

Sec. 10-42. - Report of shipments. 
    It shall be unlawful to transport radioactive material in any quantity within or through the town without the transporter's reporting such shipments on a monthly basis to the chief of police, town manager or their designee. Such reporting shall include at least the following information. 
(1)  Identification of all radioactive elements contained in the shipment by name, atomic numbers and weight. 
(2)  Identification of the radioactive level of each shipment in curies. 
(3)  Identification of the transportation route, date and approximate time of such transport into or out of the town. 
(4)  Names, addresses and telephone numbers of the persons, associations, partnerships or corporations acting as consignee, shipper or transporter.

(2)  Uranium enriched in the isotope U-235 exceeding twenty-five (25) atomic percent of the total uranium content in quantities where the U-235 content exceeds five (5) kilograms. 
(3)  Any of the actinides (i.e., elements with atomic number 89 or greater) the activity of which exceeds twenty (20) curies. 
(4)  Spend reactor fuel elements or mixed fission products associated with such spent fuel elements the activity of which exceeds twenty (20) curies. 
(5)  Any quantity of radioactive material specified as a "large quantity" by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 10 CFR Part 71, entitled "Packaging of Radioactive Material for Transport." 
(Ord. No. 82-14, § III, 9-8-82)

(2)  Radiation sources used in radiography and other nondestructive testing procedures, when used by persons duly licensed by the state. 
(3)  Radiation sources shipped by or for the United States government for military or national defense purposes. 
(4)  Teletherapy sources or radioactive materials employed in therapeutic and/or diagnostic radiology, in biomedical research or in educational endeavors, or medical devices designed for individual application (e.g., cardiac pacemakers) containing plutonium-238, promethium-147 or other radioactive material.

Upon receipt of such a complaint, the town manager shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within thirty (30) days after receiving a complaint, or within thirty (30) days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c), the town manager shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it. If the town manager decides to resolve the complaints, he shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion. Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this article without the written consent of the persons concerned. Any employee of the town manager who shall make public any information in violation of this provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished in accordance with section 1-8. 
(b)  A complaint under subsection (a) above shall be filed within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred.

If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.

The town manager may issue subpoenas to compel his access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such person, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States district court for the district in which the investigation is taking place. The town manager may administer oaths. 
(b)  Upon written application to the town manager a respondent shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the town manager to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the town manager himself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their face the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were issued at his request. 
(c)  Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the town manager shall be entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United States district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him. 
(d)  Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such person may petition the town manager to revoke or modify the subpoena. The town manager shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason. 
(e)  In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the town manager or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business. 
(f)  Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or other evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the town manager shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty (30) days or both. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the town manager, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted to the town manager pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true, and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary evidence, shall be punished in accordance with section 1-8.

A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided however, the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or section 11-35(d) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the town manager are likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained of in the complaint made to the town manager and which practice forms the basis for the action in court; and provided further, any sale, encumbrance or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this article, and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this article shall not be affected. 
(b)  The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may award to the plaintiff actual damages and punitive damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff; provided, the plaintiff in the opinion of the court is not financially able to assume attorney's fees.

Sec. 15-26. - Fraudulent checks, etc. 
(a)  Drawing and uttering. It shall be unlawful for any person, with intent to defraud, in his own name or in any other capacity, to draw, make, utter, issue or deliver to another, any check, draft or other written order on any bank or depository for the payment of money or its equivalent, whether given to obtain money, services, credit or property of any kind or nature whatever, or anything of value, when at the time of drawing, making, uttering, issuing or delivering such check or draft or other written order the maker or drawer thereof does not have an account in such bank or depository or does not have sufficient funds on deposit with such bank or depository to pay the same on presentation, or if such check, draft or other written order has an incorrect or insufficient signature thereon to be paid upon presentation. 
(b)  Presumption for prosecution. In any prosecution or action under the provisions of this section, a check, draft or other written order for which the information required in item (1) of this subsection is available at the time of issuance shall constitute prima facie evidence of the identity of the party issuing the check, draft or other written order and that such person was a party authorized to draw upon the named account. 
(1)  To establish this prima facie evidence, the full name, residence address and home telephone number of the person presenting the check, draft or other written order shall be obtained by the party receiving such instrument. Such information recorded on the check or instrument itself, or the number of a check-cashing identification card issued by the receiving party may be recorded on the check. Such check-cashing identification card shall be issued only after the full name, residence address and home telephone number of the person presenting the check, draft or other written order has been placed on file by the receiving party. 
(2)  In addition to the information required in item (1) of this subsection, the party receiving a check shall witness the signature or endorsement of the party presenting such check and as evidence of such the receiving party shall initial the check. Validation by a bank teller machine shall constitute compliance with this item. 
(c)  Duty of drawee. It shall be the duty of the drawee of any check, draft, or other written order, before refusing to pay the same to the holder thereof upon presentation, to cause to be written, printed or stamped in plain language thereon or attached thereto, the reason for drawee's dishonor or refusal to pay stamped or written thereon, or attached thereto, with the reason therefor as aforesaid, shall be prima facie evidence of the making or uttering of such check, draft, or other written order, and the due presentation to the drawee for payment and the dishonor thereof, and that the same was properly dishonored for the reasons written, stamped or attached by the drawee on such dishonored check, draft, or written order; and, as against the maker or drawer thereof, the withdrawing from deposit with the drawee named in the check, draft, or other written order, the funds on deposit with such drawee necessary to insure payment of such check, draft, or other written order upon presentation within ten (10) days after negotiation; or the drawing, making, uttering or delivering of a check, draft, or other written order, payment of which is refused by the drawee, shall be prima facie evidence of knowledge of insufficient funds in or credit with such drawee; provided, however, if it is determined at the trial in a prosecution hereunder, that the payee of any such check, draft, or written order at the time of accepting such check, draft, or written order, had knowledge of or reason to believe that the drawer of such check, draft, or other written order did not have sufficient funds on deposit in or credit with such drawee, then the payee instituting such criminal prosecution shall be assessed all costs of court incurred in connection with such prosecution. 
(d)  Elements of violation. The word "credit" as used in this section shall be construed to mean securing further advances of money, goods or services by means of a check, draft, or other written order, given in whole or in part payment of a then existing account. Payment for meals, lodging or other goods or services at any hotel, motel or other hostelry by means of a check, draft, or other written order at any time prior to or upon departure or checkout from such hostelry shall be construed as obtaining such goods or services by means of such check, draft, or other written order for the purposes of this section. This section shall not apply to any postdated check or to any check given only in full or partial payment of a preexisting debt, or to the giving of any check, draft, or other written order where the payee knows, has been expressly notified or has reason to believe that the drawer did not have an account or have on deposit with the drawee sufficient funds to insure payment thereof nor to any check which has not been deposited to an account of the payee within a period of ten (10) days from the date such check was presented to the payee. It shall also be unlawful for any person to induce, solicit or to aid and abet any other person to draw, make, utter, issue or deliver to any person including himself any check, draft, or other written order on any bank or depository for the payment of money or its equivalent, being informed, knowing or having reasonable cause for believing at the time of the inducing, soliciting or the aiding and abetting that the maker or the drawer of the check, draft, or other written order has not sufficient funds on deposit in, or an account with, such bank or depository with which to pay the same upon presentation. 
(e)  Prima facie evidence of intent. When any check, draft, or other order is not paid by the drawee because the maker or drawer did not have an account with or sufficient funds on deposit with the bank or the person upon which such draft, check, or other written order was drawn when presented or the draft, check, or order has an incorrect or insufficient signature thereon, and the maker or drawer of such check, draft, or other written order fails to pay the amount due thereon, together with a service charge of ten dollars ($10.00), within fifteen (15) days after written notice has been sent by certified mail to the address printed on the check or given at the time it is tendered or provided on a check-cashing identification card stating that payment was refused upon the instrument, then such check shall constitute prima facie evidence of fraudulent intent against the maker. All service charges collected pursuant to this section must be paid to the payee of the instrument. 
(1)  For purposes of this subsection (e), notice must be given by mailing the notice with postage prepaid addressed to such person at the address as printed or written on the instrument. The giving of notice by mail is complete upon the expiration of fifteen (15) days after such deposit of such notice in the mail. A certificate by the payee that such notice has been sent as required by this section is presumptive proof that the requirements as to notice have been met, regardless of the fact that the notice might not actually have been received by the addressee. The form of notice must be substantially as follows: 
"You are hereby notified that a check or instrument, numbered ____________ , issued by you on ____________ / ____________ / ____________ (date), drawn upon ____________ (name of bank), and payable to ____________ , has been dishonored. Pursuant to South Carolina law, you have fifteen (15) days from the date this notice was mailed to tender payment of the full amount of such check or instrument plus a service charge of ten dollars ($10.00), the total amount due being ____________ dollars and ____________ cents. Unless this amount is paid in full within the specified time above, the holder of such check or instrument may turn over this dishonored check or instrument and all other available information relating to this incident to the solicitor or other appropriate officer for criminal prosecution." 
(2)  When any person instituting prosecution gives notice in substantially similar form provided in item (1) of this subsection to the person and the bank upon which the instrument was drawn and waits fifteen (15) days from the date notice is mailed before instituting the criminal proceedings, there arises a presumption that the prosecution was instituted for reasonable and probable cause and the person instituting prosecution is immune from civil liability for the giving of such notice. 
(f)  Dismissal of prosecution. Any court, including municipal, may dismiss a case under the provisions of this section for want of prosecution. When any prosecutions are initiated under this section, the party applying for the warrant shall be held liable for all reasonable administrative costs accruing not to exceed twenty dollars ($20.00) in the event the case is dismissed for want of prosecution. Unless waived by the court, the party applying for the warrant shall notify, orally or otherwise, the court not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the date and time set for trial that full restitution has been made in connection with such warrant and such notification shall relieve that part of the responsibility of prosecution. Any court, including municipal, may dismiss any prosecution initiated pursuant to the provisions of this section, on satisfactory proof of restitution and payment by the defendant of all administrative costs accruing not to exceed twenty dollars ($20.00) submitted prior to the date set for trial after the issuance of a warrant. 
(g)  Jurisdiction of offenses and penalties. Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished as follows: 
(1)  If the amount of the instrument is one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, it shall be tried exclusively in municipal court. If the amount of the instrument is over one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), it shall be tried in the court of general sessions or any other court having concurrent jurisdiction. 
a.  Convictions in municipal court shall be punishable as follows: For a first conviction by a fine of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) or by imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days; for a second conviction by a fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00) or imprisonment for thirty (30) days; and for a third and each subsequent conviction by imprisonment for thirty (30) days. 
b.  After a conviction or plea for drawing and uttering a fraudulent check or other instrument in violation of this section and the defendant is charged or fined, he shall be required to pay in addition to such fine all reasonable court costs accruing, not to exceed twenty dollars ($20.00). 
c.  After a conviction under this section on a first offense, the defendant may, after one (1) year from the date of the conviction, apply, or cause someone acting on his behalf, to apply to the court for an order expunging the records of the arrest and conviction. This provision shall not apply to any crime classified as a felony. If the defendant has no other conviction during the one-year period following the conviction under this section, the court shall issue an order expunging the records. No person shall have any rights under this section more than one (1) time. 
(2)  As used in this section the term "conviction" shall include the entering of a guilty plea, the entering of a plea of nolo contendere, or the forfeiting bail. A conviction is classified as a felony if the instrument drawn or uttered in violation of this section exceeds the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). 
(3)  Each instrument drawn or uttered in violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 86-44, 3-12-86; Ord. No. 02-39, 12-11-02) 
Sec. 15-27. - Fleeing to evade arrest or detention. 
    If a person knows that his immediate arrest or detention is being attempted by a duly authorized law enforcement officer, it is the lawful duty of such person to refrain from fleeing either on foot or by means of any vehicle or conveyance. 
    In order for this section to apply, the law enforcement officer must be: 
(1)  Attempting to effect a lawful arrest as defined by the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1976, as amended, or as defined by this Code; or 
(2)  Attempting to detain the person because the law enforcement officer possesses reasonable suspicion to believe that the person is, or may have been, involved in criminal activity. This reasonable suspicion must be derived from circumstances known to the officer and can be supported by facts. 
Additionally, the officer must, by visible or audible means, have identified himself or herself as a law enforcement officer and ordered the person to stop. 
Any person violating the provisions of this section shall, upon conviction, be fined not more that five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days.

Introduction I.30
The Port Royal Code I-5
I.10 Background
The Port Royal Code provides a regulatory framework for preserving and enhancing existing
communities within the Town of Port Royal while promoting places of character that are both
time honored and meaningful. Common to these places is the notion of walkable urbanism 
that places of human habitat should be of a scale that is primarily pedestrian-oriented in nature,
allowing residences, businesses, and civic spaces to locate within walking distance of one another.
This approach simultaneously preserves the best aspects of urban living as well as critical open
spaces and natural resources.
The Port Royal Code also implements the 2009 Comprehensive Plan, specifically the goal to
establish a Town-wide Form-Based Code. Urban Form Goal: Update Port Royals zoning regulations
to a Form-Based Code in order to properly consider the importance of community design and character,
building placement and proportions, and the impact of private development on the public realm.
I. 20 Form-Based Codes
The Traditional Town Overlay utilized building types as its primary organizing principle. While
implementing the same concepts, The Port Royal Code uses the rural to urban transect as its
primary organizing principle, a far more extensive framework that delineates building types, but
also addresses civic spaces, thoroughfares, and other key components that impact and shape our
public realm.
I. 30 The Rural to Urban Transect
The Port Royal Code uses the rural to urban transect as its primary organizing principle. For
purposes of this ordinance a transect is a cut or cross-section of the environment that expresses the
range and variety of habitats located throughout the Town. These habitats are used to establish
zoning districts (known as transect zones or T-zones) along a continuum of intensity that ranges
from the most natural environment to the most urban environment.
Six primary transect zones are identified in a prototypical American rural-to-urban transect.
Rarely does a region contain all six transect zones. This is the case with Port Royal, which lacks the
vertically intense T6 zone that often anchors a large city with high-rise buildings, as well as the
rural T2 zone found just outside the Towns boundaries in Beaufort County. See Diagram I.30.A
(Port Royal Rural-to-Urban Transect).
Transect zones vary by the ratio and level of intensity of their natural, built, and social
The Port Royal Code is a Form-Based Code (FBC).
A Form-Based Code emphasizes physical form
(character and intensity) rather than the separation
of uses to ensure predictable built results and a
high-quality public realm.
The Port Royal Code builds upon the foundation
established by the Traditional Town Master Plan (1995)
and subsequent Overlay District Code (1997). While
primarily limited to the traditional grid, the latter
was one of the first municipal Form-Based Codes in
the United States (see Diagram I.20.A: Master Plan
for Infill Development). The Port Royal Code seeks
to update this landmark document while expanding
the Form-Based approach to zoning throughout the
entire Town.

Development.

components. This ensures that urban areas will look and feel urban, while sub-urban areas will
look and feel sub-urban. Nearly every aspect of the environment can be organized using the rural
to urban principle, including streets, civic spaces, buildings, uses, signs, fences, etc. Even within a
transect zone there frequently exists a range in these components. This allows for significant
diversity within a relatively similar environment. For example, the Port Royal Code contains three
levels of T3 (Edge, Sub-urban Neighborhood, and Neighborhood). Each of these districts is similar
in character (primarily residential), but slightly more intense and diverse than its predecessor.
The Rural-to-Urban Transect has its foundation in nature and is applicable to the lowcountry, as
has been illustrated in James Wassells cross-section depicting the Canaveral National Seashore.
See Diagram I.30.B (Transect or Cross-section of an Island).

I.40 Pedestrian Sheds
Transect-based zoning is most effective when applied at the community / neighborhood scale
using predetermined pedestrian sheds. The pedestrian shed is the fundamental building block of
walkable urbanism, and is used to represent the distance that most people are willing to walk to
a common destination such as a downtown attraction, main street shop, or neighborhood park.
Generally, this distance ranges from ¼ to ½ mile and requires a 5 to 10 minute walk. While often
depicted as perfect circles, in reality pedestrian sheds have irregular shapes, as they cover the
actual distance walked, not the linear distance.
Planners and designers use pedestrian sheds to determine the center, middle, and edge of various
communities and apply appropriate transect zones to the zoning map. See Diagrams I.40 (A-C)
below. By assigning multiple transect zones to each pedestrian shed, the resident s of a
community are exposed to a diverse environment that is highly walkable. For example, a resident
of a single-family home in T3 is able to enjoy a morning jog along the T1 marshfront. Having
worked up an appetite, they can walk to their favorite main street restaurant for breakfast (T5). On
the way home they can stop off at the neighborhood corner store (T4) to pick up some milk and
bread. In some form or fashion, these or similar opportunities should be available and located
within every residents pedestrian shed. Transect-based zoning allows for this.
I.50 Conclusion
The pedestrian shed, the rural to urban transect, and form-based standards are the central
building blocks for ensuring that walkable places  places of unique character that are time
honored and meaningful  will continue to exist and be built anew in Port Royal.

water conservation and reuse, energy conservation, renewable energy use, recycling
and waste reduction, vegetation, urban agriculture, and hazard-resilient
development;
9. Establish and maintain consistent, efficient, and equitable standards and procedures
for the review and approval of development that recognizes and respects the rights of
landowners and considers the interests of the Towns citizens (including the
relationship with the public realm); and
10. Support a range of vibrant human habitats along the transect.
B. Within the Traditional Town Core and Outlying Areas:
1. Reinforce and promote the establishment of compact, walkable, mixed-use centers within
the Towns urban and sub-urban areas;
2. Encourage the use of multi-modal transit (e.g. automobiles, buses, ferries, bicyclists,

2. Ensure that each building plays a role in creating a better whole (a better street, a
better neighborhood, a better Town), not just a good building;
3. Ensure that buildings can readily adapt to a variety of uses, allowing them to
withstand changes to the economy, the surrounding community, or the needs of their
owner / occupant;
4. Ensure that architecture and landscape grow from local climate, history, and building
practice; and
5. Ensure that landmark buildings are sited at important locations, and that they promote
a form that reflects their civic stature.

2.1.10 Purpose and Intent 2.1-1
2.1.20 Applicability 2.1-1
2.1.10 Purpose and Intent
Article 2 provides general standards for community-scaled design; including site plans and
subdivisions in which blocks, lots, civic space set-asides, and thoroughfares are created. These
standards ensure that both infill development and new neighborhoods blend seamlessly with
surrounding communities and improve the public realm. More specifically, new development shall:
A. Reinforce the unique identity of Port Royal by incorporating traditional building, lot, street,
and block patterns that are based on local context, climate, and history;
B. Reduce sprawling, auto-dependent development and transition auto-oriented areas to walkable
places of meaning that will stand the test of time;
C. Contribute to the establishment of a neighborhood or community, rather than the creation of an
isolated project;
D. Reinforce an interconnected network of blocks and thoroughfares (streets) that reduces
automobile trips;
E. Ensure that buildings and landscaping contribute to the physical definition of streets as public
places;
F. Establish appropriately sited and well-proportioned lots, allowing structures to properly orient
to streets and civic spaces;
G. Incorporate safe, effective and multi-modal transportation options, including auto, pedestrian,
bicycle, and ultimately transit;
H. Protect the site's resources in accordance with this Development Code;
I. Assure the timely provision of required streets, utilities, stormwater systems, and facilities
and services to new land development; and
J. Ensure that proposed developments are functional and internally safe to the greatest degree
possible and without adverse impact on the environment and adjoining properties.
2.1.20 Applicability

5. Dead-End Streets and Cul-de-Sacs. Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs shall not be included
in plans. Cul-de-sacs may be approved by Administrative Adjustment, as conveyed in
Section 8.6.10 (Administrative Adjustment), to accommodate a site specific environmental
feature requiring protection and/or preservation only. Cul-de-sacs approved by
Administrative Adjustment shall meet the following standards:
a. Permanent dead-end streets shall be no longer than 300 feet and shall be provided
with a cul-de-sac. Dead-end streets constrained by environmental features on 3 sides
(peninsula) may extend the minimum block face length defined in Section 2.2.70

provided, to the extent practicable, between each cul-de-sac head and the sidewalk
system of the closest adjacent road or pedestrian pathway. The access easement shall be
direct with a minimum width of 12 feet (minimum surface width of 8 feet), and may be
fronted by lots or structures; and
f. Cul-de-sacs should take one of the following forms listed in priority order from most
desirable to least desirable (Table 2.2.50.A. Cul-de-Sac Diagrams):
(1) Loop Road (internal lots front outward onto civic space).
(2) Close or Close with Vista (lots front a centrally planted median).
(3) A Court (lots fronting a centrally planted median).

We Do This Because.
Interconnected Network: An Interconnected street network increases the number of routes available for users,
resulting in less traffic, greater safety, and increased cost savings. Local drivers can choose from multiple routes, allowing
vehicles to disperse throughout the system, and keeping traffic light. If there is an accident, one simply chooses a different
path. A complete network also ensures greater access and quicker response times for emergency and service vehicles. This
results in fewer miles traveled and less consumption of fuel. More importantly, it has the potential to save lives. Finally, the
presence of an interconnected network reduces the need for costly road widening projects and new turning lanes.

2.2.60 Pedestrian Circulation
A. Pedestrian walkways shall comply with the standards found in Division 2.3 (Thoroughfare
Standards) and be constructed concurrently with the thoroughfare or, if the thoroughfare is
already constructed, prior to final inspection of any improvements. The Administrator
may waive this requirement, using the process for Administrative Adjustment, as conveyed in
Section 8.6.10 (Administrative Adjustment), if:
1. An alternative, yet equally effective pedestrian way or pedestrian / bikeway currently
exists, or will be provided outside the normal right-of-way; or
2. Unique circumstances, topographic, or natural conditions prevail to the extent that strict
adherence to said requirements would be unreasonable and not consistent with the
Purposes of this Development Code or goals of the Comprehensive Plan.
B. Reserved.
2.2.70 Blocks
A. Block Design. The design of blocks shall comply with the following:

T5 Main Street 500 ft. max. 1,600 ft. max.
1. General.
a. Where possible, blocks shall be laid out to
have their short length abutting arterials,
collectors, or the development's major road
(see Diagram 2.2.70.A: Block Design).
b. The length, width, and shape of blocks
should be determined with regard to the
provision of adequate sites for buildings of
the type proposed, the standards of this
Code, topography, fire access, emergency
service, and police protection (see Diagram
2.2.70.A: Block Design).
2. Block Shape and Size

b. Block Face and Perimeter Constraints. In cases where environmental or topographic
constraints exist, or the property has an irregular shape, an Administrative Adjustment
may be granted as set forth in Section 8.6.10 (Administrative Adjustments), and one of
the following shall be provided:
(1) An eight-foot, surfaced, pedestrian pathway easement (minimum surface width of
5 feet) shall be provided mid-block to connect parallel thoroughfares on the long
side of the block; or,
(2) An alley shall be provided mid-block to connect parallel thoroughfares on the long
side of the block.
c. Block Width. Blocks shall be, at a minimum, such width as will provide two tiers of lots.
3. Reverse Frontage Lots. Reverse Frontage Lots shall be prohibited. Arterials and Collectors
shall be incorporated into the structure of all future blocks, with access to the first tier of
lots provided directly:
a. From the thoroughfare, or
b. From a Perpendicular Street, Rear Alley / Lane, or Parallel Access Road. Parallel
Access Roads may only be used on Arterials in which the relevant area is not
specifically addressed in the Beaufort County Thoroughfare Manual.
4. Civic Space Set-Asides and Natural Resources. In areas where a grid or formal network is
desired, exceptions would be made for green spaces along drainage or stream channels or
where other natural resources make the grid difficult or cost prohibitive. The thoroughfare
and block system should be designed to preserve and protect natural areas.
5. Blocks with Industrial Development. Blocks intended for industrial development may
vary from the elements of design contained in this Section if the nature of the use requires
other treatment. In such cases, safe and convenient access to infrastructure, utilities,
parking, and the thoroughfare system shall be provided. Deviations from the standards in
this Section shall be approved by Administrative Adjustment as set forth in Section 8.6.10
(Administrative Adjustments).
B. Reserved.
2.2.80 Lots
A. Lots shall be designed to ensure complete, double -tiered blocks, and comply with the
following:
1. Frontage. The primary frontage of a lot shall be along one of the following:
a. Thoroughfare. A thoroughfare right-of-way;
b. Single-loaded Frontage Streets. A thoroughfare with development on one side and a
civic space on the other;
c. Civic Space. Up to 10 percent of the lots in a development may locate their primary
frontage directly upon a civic space in which there is no thoroughfare located between
the primary frontage and the civic space (see Diagram 2.2.80. A).
We Do This Because.
Block Width and Depth: The Town of Port Royals streets were originally laid out as a grid (See Cover).
Much of the traditional Town (primarily south of 16th Street) maintains this pattern. Blocks are typically 500
feet in length by 200 feet in width. The Port Royal Code allows for the continuation of this historic pattern.

d. Pedestrian Passage or Rear Alley / Lane. Up to 5 percent of the lots in a development
may locate their primary frontage directly upon a Pedestrian Passage or Rear Alley /
Lane (see Diagrams 2.2.80. B-C).
2. Avoid Double Frontage Lots. New lots having double frontage, not located on a corner,
shall not be permitted unless they are necessitated by size or topographic constraints. For
existing lots with frontage on two streets, but not located on a corner, the minimum front
setback shall be provided on each street.
3. Access to Lots from Rear Alleys and Lanes.
a. Alleys and Lanes that conform to the standards in Division 2.3 (Thoroughfare
Standards) shall be provided along the rear property lines of lots intended for new
residential, non-residential, and mixed-use development when the lots:
(1) Are part of a block face with an average lot width of 55 feet or less at the building
setback line (excluding lots on cul-de-sacs); or
(2) Front an Arterial thoroughfare in which a Parallel Access Road is not present or
planned (regardless of lot width).
b. Lots served by alleys and lanes, including those in accordance with Subsection a.
above, that are intended for new single-family, two-family, or multi-family dwellings
shall:
(1) Access garages and/or off-street parking areas from the alley as opposed to a
primary throroughfare.
(2) Not have driveways in front or corner side yard areas.
4. Driveway Access to Single and Two-Family Residential Lots. Driveways serving
individual Single and Two-Family residential lots shall not have direct access onto Arterial
thoroughfares, unless no alternative means of access exists (e.g. Perpendicular Road, Rear
Alley, or Parallel Access Road), and it is unreasonable or impractical to require an
alternative means of access.
5. Consider Resources and Other Natural Features. The arrangement of lots shall reflect the
location of protected resources and be sensitive to the other natural features of the
property.
B. Lot Width.
1. Reflect General Conditions of Land. Lot width and frontage shall reflect the general
conditions of the land on which the development is located, and provide a reasonable
building envelope and adequate access to each lot.
2. Where Grid System Exists. Where a grid street system exists, the lots should be as close to
rectangular as feasible.

3. When Resources Make Normal Lotting Difficult. Where natural resources or property
shape make normal lotting difficult, common drives or shared easements may be
considered.
a. Flag Lots. Flag Lots are prohibited and may only be permitted using the process for
Administrative Adjustment, as conveyed in Section 8.6.10 (Administrative Adjustment), if:
(1) Connectivity and circulation via a network of streets, alleys, pathways, etc, will
be maintained;
(2) There is no reasonable alternative due to extreme topographic conditions or
other physical conditions; and
(3) The lot has an access strip with a minimum width of 20 serving the main
building site of the property. The front setback on flag lots shall be measured
from the front property line within the main building site as opposed to the
property line adjoining the public right-of-way.
b. Reserved.
C. Lot Lines. Lot lines shall comply with the following:
1. General. Generally, side lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to the thoroughfare, and
rear lines should be approximately parallel to thoroughfare lines. However, different lot
shapes are allowed if it is demonstrated they are necessary or desirable to:
a. Better relate building sites to the terrain on the site, or to provide better site utilization
and building relationships;
b. Preserve protected resources or other natural features while still providing generally
rectangular building envelopes;
c. Better integrate civic space set-asides while still providing generally rectangular
building envelopes; or
d. Create a more efficient lot design and layout while still providing generally
rectangular building envelopes.
2. Depth of Lots. The depth of residential lots shall not be less than their width.
D. Minimum Lot Elevation and Drainage
1. General. Lots shall be provided with adequate drainage in accordance with this Code and
all other relevant requirements, and shall be graded, so as to drain surface water away
from the building(s).
2. Prevent Ponding or Flooding. The minimum elevation of the lot shall be a level that will
prevent ponding or flooding as a result of heavy rain, or during abnormally high tides.
3. Drain Lot. The entire lot shall be properly drained at a minimum slope of one-eighth inch
per foot toward roadside and/or lot swales.
We Do This Because.
Rear Alleys and Lanes: Alleys and lanes have both a functional and aesthetic basis. An alleyway is where all of the messy stuff
should go. This includes driveways, garage doors, trash containers, recycling bins, and utility boxes and meters. When utilities are located
on an alleyway the street can be significantly narrower, resulting in less pavement, more trees, and wider sidewalks. Freeing the street of
such clutter allows a buildings front façade to be sited closer to the street and places greater emphasis on human habitation (e.g.
porches and stoops over garages and driveways). Finally, alleyways provide occupants of accessory dwelling units with vehicular access to
their unit, but more importantly, they afford fire trucks with an alternative path to the main building (or buildings) on the block.

2.2.90 Access Management
A. Access to Town, State, and Federal Thoroughfares. Access to Town, State, and Federal
thoroughfares shall comply with the standards established in this Section; and shall
compliment the standards established in: the Beaufort County Technical Manual, Division
2.3 (Thoroughfare Standards), Article 3 (Specific to Zones), and this Development Code.
1. Curb Cuts and Access Points. Ingress-egress openings commonly referred to as "curb
cuts" shall be regulated by zoning district.
2. Combine Curb Cuts and Access Points. To the maximum extent practicable, curb cuts
and other vehicular access points along a street shall be combined.
3. Size of Curb Cuts and Access Points. In no case shall a curb cut or other vehicular
access point be less than nine feet or more than 25 feet in width.
4. Location of Curb Cuts and Access Points. At street intersections, no curb cut shall
be located closer than: 20 feet from the intersecting point of the two street right-of-way
property lines involved (or such lines extended in case of a rounded corner); or 25 feet
from the intersection of the two curb lines involved (or such lines extended in case of a
rounded corner), whichever is the least restrictive.
B. Access Through Parking Lots. Linkages
between parking areas within the
perimeter of the block (and half block)
should be encouraged when a rear alley or
lane is present, and shall be provided
when there is no rear alley or lane. See
Diagram 2.2.90.A (Access through parking
lots).
C. Gated Communities. Communities that
limit access by the public through the
utilization of entryway gates interfere
with interconnectivity and vehicular and
pedestrian mobility and shall be
prohibited.
D.
Diagram 2.2.90.A: Access through parking lots.
We Do This Because.
Terminated Vista: A terminated vista is a building, object, or feature
that serves as a focal point and interrupts or blocks the view as one
looks down a street or corridor. Such features improve spatial definition
and orientation by creating memorable places that stimulate the senses
and make our communities more interesting. Historically, the numbered
streets in Port Royal terminated with a view of the river or marsh. This
reinforces our communitys surroundings and fondness for the water.
When a street vista terminates on a building, it should be architecturally
pleasing, if not significant. 13th Street terminates on historic Port Royal
Elementary School. This prominent vista reinforces our communitys
belief in education, our youth, and the future.
We Do This Because.
Reverse Frontage Lots: Reverse frontage lots are often used in
suburban settings when new residential neighborhoods are created
along major thoroughfares. Houses on these lots turn their back on
the main road and are separated by a planted buffer or berm.
Because the houses do not front the thoroughfare (either directly or
via a frontage road) this design is inefficient, dangerous, and scaled
entirely to the automobile. A traditional street network promotes
single frontage lots in which all thoroughfares are fronted by
buildings. The buildings frontage establishes a strong vertical edge.
This has the effect of slowing traffic, creating interesting places to
walk to, and increasing the number of eyes on the street.

2.3.10 Purpose
The intent of this Division is to provide a catalog of pre-approved thoroughfare components and
assemblies that are appropriate to use within each transect zone. Components can be combined to
form thoroughfares. Assemblies are pre-approved groupings of components. Both are suitable for
use in new developments, as well as the retrofit of existing locations, and can be used in
subdivision and community planning activities that promote walkable places.
2.3.20 Applicability
A. This Division describes the standards for developing thoroughfares within transect zones. It
supplements the "Beaufort County Technical Manual." Where these standards conflict with the
"Beaufort County Technical Manual", the standards of this division shall prevail.
B. These standards are applicable for the transformation of existing thoroughfares and the
creation of new thoroughfares in any area within a transect zone.
C. Thoroughfare standards are applicable for the design of collector and local streets.
Thoroughfare standards applied to existing arterials and roadways under the jurisdiction of the
South Carolina Department of Transportation may require additional review in order to obtain
approval.
D. Additional thoroughfare assemblies can be integrated into this division as they are approved
by the Town.
2.3.30 Assembling / Designing a Thoroughfare
There are three general procedures for assembling or designing a thoroughfare for approval.
A. Choose a predefined thoroughfare assembly found in Section 2.3.80 (Thoroughfare
Assemblies). These thoroughfare assemblies are allowed by right;
B. Assemble a thoroughfare that matches the standards found in Table 2.3.90.A (Thoroughfare
Formulas) and use only the predefined components in Tables 2.3.90.B-J.
a. If all of the predefined components are permitted: then the thoroughfare is
permitted without additional review.
b. If one or more of the predefined components is permitted: then the
thoroughfare shall be submitted for additional review by the Administrator.

C. Design a thoroughfare that matches the standards found in Table 2.3.90A (Thoroughfare
Formulas) but utilizes components that differ from the predefined components in Tables
2.3.90.B-J. This thoroughfare will require approval by the Town, including the Zoning
Administrator, Engineer, Public Works Division, and Fire District representatives.
2.3.40 Thoroughfare Design
A. Thoroughfares are intended for use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic and to provide access to
lots and civic spaces.
B. Thoroughfares shall generally consist of vehicular lanes and public frontages.
C. Thoroughfares shall be designed in context with the urban form and general intention of the
zones through which they pass.
1. Within the more urban transect zones (T3 through T5) pedestrian comfort shall be a
primary consideration of the thoroughfare design. Design conflict between vehicular and

Thoroughfare Standards 2.3.50
The Port Royal Code 2-15
D. The requirements for pedestrian and bicyclist safety, comfort and access shall establish
thoroughfare movement type and design speed. The movement type and design speed then
determine the dimensions of each thoroughfare element, such as vehicular lanes and turning
(curb) radii.
E. Thoroughfares shall be designed according to the types of vehicles expected to use each
thoroughfare on a daily basis. Occasionally, large vehicles are expected on all thoroughfares.
All thoroughfares shall allow these vehicles to safely pass without major difficulty. It is
expected that large vehicles may cross the centerline when making turning movements.
F. Other factors that may need to be considered in the selection of an appropriate thoroughfare
type in transect zones include the following:
1. Parking. Parking availability on-site or on the thoroughfare will influence the appropriate
thoroughfare type. Parking will also be determined by lot size and use.
2. Truck Access. Thoroughfares that provide access to high volumes of large trucks may need
additional design considerations to mitigate potential negative effects on walkability.
3. Bus Service. Thoroughfares that will serve as a public transit or school bus routes may
need additional design considerations, including, but not limited to, the location of bus
stops.
4. Stormwater. Thoroughfares may be designed to accommodate stormwater treatment and
retention facilities.
G. All lane dimensions shall be measured to the face of the curb. Where no curb and gutter is
provided, the lane dimension shall be to the edge of the pavement.
H. Traffic Control and Street Signs. Traffic control and street signs, constructed to required
specifications, shall be installed at all thoroughfare intersections at the developer's expense.
2.3.50 Movement Types and Design Speed
Movement types are intended to assist in the selection of the appropriate thoroughfare design for
the necessary level of pedestrian and bicyclist safety and comfort at any given location. Design
speed is the primary determinant of movement type. A list of approved movement types (along
with their assigned lane widths and curb radii) is provided for each transect zone in Tables
2.3.90.A-D.
Following is a list of movement types:
A. Yield. Drivers must proceed slowly, with extreme care, and must yield to approaching traffic
when vehicles are parked on both sides of the thoroughfare creating essentially one through
lane. A Yield thoroughfare is the functional equivalent of traffic calming. In addition to yield
movement use on normal thoroughfares, this movement is used for alleys and rear lanes. For
these applications, the primary purpose is access to rear loaded driveways/access for
residential and commercial property. Design speed is less than 20 mph.
B. Slow. Drivers can proceed carefully with an occasional stop to allow a pedestrian to cross or
another car to park. The character of the thoroughfare should make drivers uncomfortable
exceeding the design speed due to the presence of parked cars, sense of enclosure from
buildings and street trees, tight turning radii, and other design elements. Design speed is 20-25
mph.
C. Low. Drivers can generally expect to travel without delay at the appropriate design speed.
Thoroughfare design supports safe pedestrian movement at the higher design speed. This
movement type is appropriate for thoroughfares designed to traverse longer distances or
connect to higher intensity locations. Design speed is 30-35 mph.
D. Suburban. This is a conventional thoroughfare design in which drivers can expect a separation
of modes (i.e., bike lanes, walking paths and roads) allowing automobiles to travel unimpeded
by pedestrians or walkability concerns. This movement type is rarely used in the T3 through T5
2.3.70 Thoroughfare Standards
2-16 The Port Royal Code
Transect Zones, but may be needed when a thoroughfare crosses through the T1 Transect Zone.
Design speed may be above 35 mph.
The design criteria for Yield, Slow, and Low thoroughfares shall be commensurate with local
thoroughfares. Design speeds higher than 35 mph shall not be used in areas intended to support
moderate or high levels of pedestrian or bicycle activity due to concerns with safety and comfort.
2.3.60 Intersections
A. Turning Movements
1. Street design of narrow streets and compact intersections requires designers to pay close
attention to the operational needs of transit, fire and rescue, waste collection and delivery
trucks. For this reason, early coordination with transit, fire and rescue, waste collection and
other stakeholder groups is essential.
2. More regular encroachment of turning vehicles into opposing lanes will occur at compact
intersections. Therefore, frequency of access, traffic volumes and the speeds on intersecting
streets at those intersections must be considered when designing intersections. For fire and
rescue, determination of the importance of that street for community access should be
determined, e.g. primary or secondary access.
3. When present, bike lanes and on-street parking will increase the effective curb return
radius, when curb extensions are not employed, by providing more room for the wheel
tracking of turning vehicles. The designer should use turning templates or software to
evaluate intersections to ensure adequate operation of vehicles can occur. Location of onstreet
parking around intersections should be evaluated during this analysis to identify
potential conflicts between turning vehicles and on-street parking.
B. Visual Obstructions. No fence, wall, tree, terrace, building, sign, shrubbery, hedge, or other
planting or structure or object capable of obstructing driver vision shall be allowed at
intersections.
C. Street Jogs. Street intersection jogs or centerline offsets of less than 150 feet are prohibited in
the horizontal alignment of streets across intersections.
D. Intersections. The centerline of no more than two streets should intersect at any one point.
Streets should be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No street
should intersect another street at less than 60 degrees.
2.3.70 Public Frontages
A. The public frontage contributes to the character of the zone, and includes the types of sidewalk,
curb, planter, and street trees.
B. Public frontages shall be designed and allocated within zones as shown in Table 2.3.90.E
(Public Frontage Types) and Table 2.3.90.F (Public Frontage Standards).
C. Within the public frontages, the prescribed types of public planting and public lighting shall be
as shown in Tables 2.3.90.G-J. The spacing may be adjusted with the approval of the
Administrator to accommodate specific site conditions.
D. Existing trees may count towards the street tree requirement if approved by the Administrator.
1. Proposed street tree height and type shall be appropriate for the frontage conditions. Trees
with existing or potential canopy covering thoroughfares, civic spaces or parking spaces shall
be of a type that, at maturity or with minor pruning at installation, provide a clear height as
describe in the Table 2.3.90.H (Clear Height Under Trees).
2. Reserved.
E. Street Landscaping. Refer to Table 2.3.70.A (Street Landscaping) for standards.

F. Public Utilities. Public utilities (water, sewer, electric, gas, cable) shall be buried, as conveyed
in Sub-section 2.5.40.B (Utility Easements and Lines). Utilities shall be planned and constructed
to use the right of way or easement associated with rear lanes or alleys first (the default), and
thoroughfares second.

2.4.70 Maintenance of Set-Asides 2-49
2.4.10 Purpose
The purpose of this division is to provide a set of civic space types and their associated standards
to use within all zones.
Civic space set-asides are intended for the use and enjoyment of a developments residents,
employees, or users. Civic space set-asides serve numerous purposes, including preservation of
resource protection areas, other natural areas, ensuring resident access to open areas and
recreation, reducing the heat island effect, enhancing stormwater quality, and providing public
health benefits.
2.4.20 Applicability
The standards established in this division shall apply to all proposed development subject to Site
Development Plan Review (see Division 8.3 Site Development Review) and Major Subdivision
Review (see Division 8.4 Subdivision Review), and shall be considered in combination with the
standards for the applicable zone in Article 3 (Specific to Zones) and Article 5 (Supplemental to
Zones).
All Agricultural Uses (see Division 4.1 Principal Uses Allowed in Each Zone) shall be exempt from
the requirements of this Division.
2.4.30 Civic Space Types
A. There are 12 different civic space types defined in Table 2.4.30.A (Civic Space Type Standards).
Two of the civic space types, Playgrounds and Community Gardens, may be incorporated into
any of the other civic space types, or they may stand alone.
B. In Table 2.4.30.A (Civic Space Type Standards), the illustration and description of each civic
space type are illustrative in nature and not regulatory.
C. The service area, size, frontage and disposition of elements standards of each civic space type
are regulatory.
1. Service Area. Describes how the civic space relates to the Town as a whole and the area
that will be served by the civic space.
2. Size. The overall range of allowed sizes of the civic space.
3. Frontage. The relationship along property lines of a civic space to adjacent buildings or
lots.
2.4.30 Civic Space Types
4-44 The Port Royal Code
a. Building. Civic spaces that are listed as having a building frontage shall have the
fronts of buildings, either attached to the park or across a thoroughfare, facing onto
the civic space for a minimum of three quarters of the perimeter.
b. Independent. Civic spaces that are listed as having an independent frontage shall
have the fronts of buildings either attached to the park or across a thoroughfare,
facing onto the civic space to the maximum extent possible, but may have the side or
rear of a building or lot front onto the civic space. The side or rear of a building or lot
fronting onto the civic space shall be designed with a secondary frontage and
entrance along the civic space.
4. Disposition of Elements. The placement of objects within the civic space.
a. Natural. Civic spaces with natural character are designed in a natural manner with no
formal arrangement of elements.
b. Formal. Civic spaces with a formal character have a more rigid layout that follows
geometric forms and has trees and other elements arranged in formal patterns.
c. Informal. Civic spaces with an informal character have a mix of formal and natural
characteristics.
D. Typical Facilities. A list of the typical facilities found within the civic space. This list is not
intended to be a complete list of facilities allowed nor is it intended that every civic space
would contain each of the facilities listed.
E. The civic spaces specified in Table 2.4.30.A (Civic Space Type Standards) are allowed by right
or with the specified approvals in the designated zones.
We Do This Because.
Regulate Civic Space Type as Opposed to Open Space Area: Well-designed and
well-located civic spaces such as parks, greens, squares, and plazas are critical components of a
thriving and vibrant community. They provide important organizing elements within the structure of a
neighborhood, public gathering places for residents and visitors, and opportunities to creatively and
efficiently address stormwater.
Unfortunately, the quality of most recently built civic spaces is extremely low. This is because current
standards primarily regulate the amount of open space required, as opposed to prescribing the
desired type and character of each civic space. Many developers simply designate leftover fragments
of land as open space, resulting in communal spaces that are little more than an after-thought.

2.4.40 Design of Civic Spaces
A. Design Standards for Civic Space. Land used as civic space shall meet the following design
standards:
1. Location. Where relevant and appropriate, the land shall be located so as to be readily
accessible and usable by residents and users of the development. To the maximum extent
practicable, a portion of the civic space set-aside should provide focal points for the
development.
2. Configuration
a. The land shall be compact and contiguous unless it is used for continuation of an
existing trail, or if specific natural or topographic features require a different
configuration.
b. The land shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be located to adjoin, extend, and
enlarge any open areas, trails, parks, or other open space resources that exist or are
planned adjacent to the development.
3. Provision in Multi-Phase Developments. In multi-phase developments, civic space setasides
shall be apportioned among the phases such that the total amount of civic space set
aside in a phase and any previously approved phases meets the civic space set-aside
standard as applied to the total area of the phase and any previously approved phases.
B. Accessory Structure Standards. All accessory structures within parks and civic spaces,
including, but not limited to, rest rooms, open-air pavilions, gazebos, picnic shelters and
outdoor theaters, shall not be subject to the physical requirements of the building form
standards in Article 3 (Specific to Zones). They shall be designed and furnished to be
consistent with the character of the zone in which they are located. Such consistency may
require accessory structures to maintain building setbacks, frontage, massing, disposition and
character similar to adjacent development as determined by the Administrator.
2.4.50 Set Aside Requirement
A. Minimum Set Aside Requirement. Development in all zones shall set aside the minimum
amounts of civic space set-aside identified in Table 2.4.50.A (Set-Aside Requirement).
Table 2.4.50.A: Set Aside Requirement
Transect
Zone
Required Set Aside for Development:
< 4 Acres 4 or More Acres

A. Set-aside areas shall be maintained as permanent civic space through one or more of the
following options:
1. The property owner establishes an entity to manage and maintain the set-aside area in a
form that ensures long-term maintenance and management;
2. Conveyance of the land to a property owners or homeowners association that holds the
land in common ownership and will be responsible for managing and maintaining it for
its intended purposes;
3. Conveyance of the land to a third party beneficiary, such as a nonprofit environmental or
civic organization, that is organized for, capable of, and willing to accept responsibility
for managing and maintaining the land for its intended purposes;
4. Dedication of the land to the Town or other appropriate public agency that is organized
for, capable of, and willing to accept responsibility for managing and maintaining the

shall be required to service his subdivision with this system provided that the
public agency having authority over the system has agreed to provide such service.
A written agreement between the subdivider and the agency indicating the
arrangements made for provision of the service shall be submitted with the final
application. Such agreement shall clearly state the responsibilities of both parties as
they relate to installation and maintenance of the facility(s).
B. Utility Easements and Lines .
1. Utility Easements. Easements having a minimum width of eight feet and located
along the side or rear lot lines shall be provided as required for utility lines and
underground mains and cables.
2. Utility Lines. All utility lines within a development site shall be installed
underground. This provision shall not apply to those lines installed upon an
individual single-family or two-family property except where those properties will be
served by underground distribution lines located in newly established subdivisions.
3. Administrative Adjustment. Where overhead facilities are warranted due to exigencies
of construction, undue and unreasonable hardship, or other conditions related to the
development, the respective utility may request an Administrative Adjustment to allow
for overhead facilities prior to final subdivision plat approval (see Section 8.6.10
Administrative Adjustment).

2.5.50 Survey and Engineering
A. Installation of Permanent Reference Points and Required Improvements
1. Permanent Reference Points. Permanent reference points shall be placed
in accordance with the following requirements:
a. Control monuments. Control monuments shall be placed in the pavement of
subdivision streets so that no subdivision lot is more than 800 feet from a
control monument. The Control Monuments should be placed in the streets,
offset from the center line to avoid sanitary sewer lines, to be approximately
half way between the center line and edge of the pavement. Where practical,
control monuments shall be placed at points of curvature and points of
tangency of curves. The control monument may be poured on the job or be a
concrete marker of the type commonly used in the area at least three feet long,
and tapered with a twelve inch long 1/4 inch diameter brass or bronze rod
embedded in the top. Control monuments shall be placed in a cast iron water
main valve type box with a cover flush with the pavement.
b. Property Marker. A steel or wrought iron pipe, rebar, or the equivalent, not less
than one-half (0.5) inches in diameter and at least 30 inches in length shall be
set at all property corners and points oil curves, except those located by
Monuments.
c. Accuracy. Land surveys within the Town Limits shall be set at an accuracy of
at least 1:7500; beyond the Town Limits an accuracy of not less than 1:5000 is
required.
2.5.60 Improvement Guarantees
To assure the complete installation and maintenance of required improvements, prior to final
plat approval, an applicant/developer who wishes to acquire building permits, construct any
infrastructure of any type or sell lots before final plat approval may do so through bonding, an
irrevocable letter-of-credit and agreement, or other financial security acceptable to the town.
The developer shall provide the town with an itemized estimate of all necessary improvements
in the subdivision as may be needed (i.e. roads, drainage, water, sewer, etc.). If a portion of the
improvements have been installed and accepted and/or approved by the town or other
governmental agency having authority over that infrastructure component (i.e. water and
sewer), the itemized estimate will be for the improvements from that point to completion of the
subdivision. Once the estimates have been approved by the town, the developer will then
present the town with a bond, surety or other acceptable means of credit for the total of the
improvements plus twenty-five (25) percent in a form acceptable to the town. The town will
allow separate bonds to be issued to cover specific infrastructure components for water and
sewer and/or for other infrastructure that may be operated and maintained by another
governmental entity other than the town. However, the total of all bonds posted must total, at a
minimum, one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the total cost of all infrastructure required
to complete the intended improvements.
Prior to issuance of a building or construction permit by the town for the construction of any
infrastructure of any type within the property or development, a bond or legal surety, acceptable
to the town, guaranteeing the completed installation of all required public and infrastructure
improvements to the development and other such improvements shown on the engineering
drawings for the development or represented in the application [is required]. Such bonds or other
surety shall be payable to the town and equal one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of a
registered engineer estimate of construction costs or contractors' executed contracts for
2.5.80 Specific to Subdivision
2-56 The Port Royal Code
subdivision public and infrastructure improvements, whichever is greater. The applicant shall
complete, in a manner acceptable to the town, all improvements including required mechanisms
guaranteeing perpetual ownership and maintenance, within twelve (12) months of the date of
issuance of a building or construction permit(s) by the town. Failure to do so will constitute a
violation of such permit(s) and terminate the right to continue development, and shall entitle the
town to act on the posted bond, surety or other guarantee(s) and cause the public and
infrastructure improvements to be completed by the town on behalf of the lot purchasers in the
development. Extension to the 12-month time period afforded for completion of improvements
may be granted one (1) time at the sole discretion of the town. Such requests must be submitted
prior to the expiration date of such permit(s) and accompanied by:
A. A detailed explanation of why the extension is necessary;
B. Signed/dated agreement to the extension by all affected lot owners in the development to
date;
C. A detailed description of the amount of work completed, cost remaining for incomplete work
and time frame for completion of work; all must be certified by a state professional registered
engineer;
D. Amended bond, or other such surety for incomplete work in an amount of one hundred
twenty-five (125) percent of the cost of completion and of sufficient duration to secure the
completion of the work.
The town is hereby granted the power to enforce such bonds by all appropriate legal and
equitable remedies. To assure the complete installation and maintenance of required
improvements, prior to final plat approval, the town council may require a bond, in an amount
and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and securing to the town the actual
construction, installation and maintenance of such improvements with a period of time specified
by the town and expressed in the bond. The town is hereby granted the power to enforce such
bonds by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. The town may accept other means of
securing the actual installation and/or maintenance of required improvements.
2.5.70 Thoroughfare Drawing and Construction Specifications
A. Design Drawings and Certification. Professional engineers, registered in the state, shall
prepare plans, profiles, cross sections, and specifications for all new roads and streets. The
engineers shall certify roads/streets are built to comply with the approved plans and
specifications. Cross sections shall be developed every 100 feet at intersections and break
points in grade. Cross sections shall show travelways, shoulders, ditches, or curb and gutter, if
applicable, and utility location.
B. Construction Specifications for Paved Streets. Street construction specifications for paved
streets shall be in compliance with the Towns Engineering Standards.
2.5.80 Traffic Impact Analysis
A. Traffic impact analysis required.
1. Except as outlined below, a traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be required for any
development that would generate more than fifty (50) trips during the peak hour of the
adjacent street. A second phase, second subdivision, or addition that takes a property
over the trip limitation when taken as a whole shall also require a TIA even though that
development does not qualify on its own. The town staff shall determine whether a TIA is
complete. Thorough and complete TIA's are the responsibility of the applicant. Failure by
Specific to Subdivision 2.5.80
The Port Royal Code 2-57
the applicant to provide a complete TIA may result in review delays for their plat or plan.
A use shall not be changed to another use permitted in the district without conducting a
new TIA, if required.
2. Development on lots in the downtown districts defined as south of Ribaut Road,
bounded by Richmond Avenue on the east and The Battery Creek on the west extending
all the way south on the peninsula to and including the Port Redevelopment Property as
well as "The Sands," shall not be subject to the requirements of this section.
B. Traffic impact analysis plan preparation.
1. The TIA shall be conducted by an engineer registered in the state that is experienced in
the conduct of traffic analysis, and approved by the town's reviewing staff.
2. Prior to beginning the traffic impact analysis plan, the applicant shall supply the town
with the following:
a. A written narrative describing the proposed land use(s), size and projected opening
date of the project and all subsequent phases;
b. A site location map showing surrounding development within one-half ( 1/2) mile of
the property under development consideration; and
c. A proposed site plan or preliminary subdivision plat illustrating access to public or
private roads and connectivity to other contiguous developments.
3. Town reviewing staff will rely upon the most current edition ITE trip generation manual
or any alternative acceptable to the engineering department, and available information on
land use, travel patterns and traffic conditions, and after consulting with the SCDOT will
supply in writing to the applicant and/or his engineer the parameters to be followed in
the study including the directional split of driveway traffic, trip distribution, background
traffic growth rate, previously approved but not completed projects and the intersections
to be analyzed along with any associated turning movement counts which are available
or discussed and approved by the reviewing staff.
C. Plan content.
1. All phases of a development are subject to review, and all traffic plans for the entire
development shall be integrated with the overall traffic analysis. A traffic impact analysis
plan for a specific phase of development shall be applicable to the phase of development
under immediate review. However, each phase of development shall expand and provide
detailed analysis at the development plan stage beyond the estimates provided for at the
concept plan or master plan stage.
2. The adequacy of the roads to which the development takes access shall be assessed in the
TIA. Recommendations for improvements shall be made. The relative share of the
capacity created shall be broken down as follows: development share, other
developments share, any existing over capacity, and capacity available for future growth.
3. Residential development, residential care facilities, hospitals, hotels and resort-oriented
developments shall submit an emergency evacuation analysis (EEA), as part of the TIA.
The EEA shall indicate how the proposed development utilizes the county's prescribed
evacuation routes, as shown in the Beaufort County Comprehensive Plan. The
transportation planner or traffic engineer preparing the report shall indicate the effect of
the proposed development upon existing evacuation times for that portion of the county.
The EEA shall be reviewed by the Beaufort County Director of Public Safety prior to
submittal as part of the TIA.
2.5.80 Specific to Subdivision
2-58 The Port Royal Code
4. The following elements shall be included in a traffic impact analysis plan:
a. A site plan or subdivision plat identifying accesses to and from existing or proposed
streets and intersections.
b. Description of the proposed development, including the type of proposed land use,
the number of residential units by type, the number of existing and proposed lots, the
type of proposed nonresidential development and the amount of such development
measured by gross floor area or other appropriate unit of measurement, the general
size and type of accessory development or facilities, and, for nonresidential
development, adequate information to identify the appropriate land use category for
trip generation. The traffic impact analysis plan will be projected to a date mutually
agreed upon by the applicant and staff.
c. Projected vehicular trips to and from the completed development during a.m. and
p.m. peak hour. Trip rates shall be taken from ITE manual, provided, however an
applicant may elect to perform, at his own expense, a trip generation study which
may be submitted as part of the traffic impact analysis plan. Such trip generation
study shall be subject to the review and verification of the town reviewing staff. For
proposed uses not specifically listed in the ITE manual, and for which a trip
generation study has not been performed, the town engineer, in consultation with the
traffic engineer, shall determine the most appropriate trip generation rate. The town
reviewing staff shall make the determination of the appropriate trip generation rate,
from whatever the source. The percentage of pass-by trips, if used in the plan, shall
be included, as well as the source of the percentage of pass-by trip information.
d. A written narrative setting forth the assumptions upon which any projection, made
in developing the traffic impact analysis plan, shall be included in the analysis. If the
assumptions are derived from the ITE manual, the materials shall be referenced and
properly cited. If the assumptions are not from the ITE manual, appropriate excerpts
from other reliable transportation planning resources shall be included in the study
and reasons underlying the assumptions shall be stated in the narrative.
e. The TIA shall review access to the site. The adequacy of the entrance design shall be
evaluated and recommendations made of acceleration and deceleration lanes, left
turn lanes, or signalizations shall be part of the TIA.
f. The TIA shall review the number and types of curb cuts that are permitted. In
particular, the TIA shall assess the connection of the property to adjoining properties.
Where the use, scale of development, or size of adjoining properties is such that trips
would be anticipated between the proposed use and the other properties the TIA
shall make recommendation on interconnections. The TIA shall recommend
interconnections to provide a smooth flow of traffic between uses along arterials and
collector roads to ensure that as much traffic as possible uses secondary roads rather
than major roads for short trips.
g. The traffic impact analysis shall be based on intersection analysis procedures for
signalized intersections as identified in the most current edition of the transportation
research board's highway capacity manual and/or the last update that analyzes and
emulates these procedures by means of computer software if available. The results of
any required analysis/computer analysis shall, at a minimum, indicate compliance or
variance from the traffic goals in subsection (j). The traffic impact analysis plan will
be projected to a date mutually agreed upon by the applicant and staff.
Specific to Subdivision 2.5.80
The Port Royal Code 2-59
h. The intersections that must be analyzed in the study are identified to be as follows:
1. Any intersection that serves as a development's point of access. This will include
intersections of public and/or private roads with major arterials, and driveways offering
direct access.
2. The first major intersection as identified by the town's designated traffic engineer on both
sides of the development's point of access.
3. Other intersections on major arterials if development generates more than fifty (50) a.m.
or p.m. peak hour trips to that intersection or when in the opinion of the TRC there is a
potential for a significant impact to the intersection's level of service from site related
4. traffic, or intersection demand critical.
5. Unsignalized intersections and access drives shall be considered if development impacts
are anticipated. The plan must include the results of an analysis of the operating
conditions of critical intersections and/or all intersections identified in the concept plan.
The analysis shall reflect the projected condition of these intersections and movements,
based on the scheduled opening date of the development. Other phases of the
development if they can be reasonably determined shall be considered as well.
D. Mitigation plan required. If the initial analysis indicates that the town's adopted traffic service
level goals will be exceeded, a mitigation plan must be prepared based on additional analysis.
The mitigation plan must show how the town's service level goals are addressed as mitigated.
Applicants will be responsible to mitigate the traffic impacts at any intersection effected by a
proposed development.
1. If a traffic signal is recommended, the analysis shall provide information that does the
following:
a. Clearly indicates the need for a traffic signal.
b. Assesses the ability of other existing or planned or proposed public roads to
accommodate the new traffic at a location other than the main highway in the vicinity
of the proposed development.
c. Describes in detail how a specific development will affect the study area
transportation system.
d. Provides documentation of appropriate South Carolina Manual of Uniform Traffic
Control Devices (SCMUTCD) signal warrant satisfaction.
e. Gives design geometry of the private road that is consistent with that of public road
intersections including curbs, appropriate lane widths, pavement markings and
vertical alignment. Other roadway factors to be considered include, but are not
limited to, speed, type of highway, grades, sight distance, existing level of service,
conflicting accesses, and the effect of future traffic signal systems.
f. Provides an approach throat length for the road to guarantee the movement of
vehicles entering the site will not be impeded by on-site conditions, and insure that
all signal spacing requirements are adequately met.
2. A traffic signal progression analysis is required if the proposed location is closer than the
SCDOT standards given the presence of existing signals or the possible existence of future
signals proposed as part of a highway signal system.
2.5.80 Specific to Subdivision
2-60 The Port Royal Code
3. The desirable spacing of signalized intersections on principal arterials is the SCDOT,
county, or town standards. The town's reviewing staff may recommend to SCDOT the
installation of a traffic signal at locations where using SCDOT standards spacing is
inappropriate due to: topography, existing or proposed road layout; documented
accident history; unique physical constraints; existing or proposed land use patterns; or
requirements to achieve specific objectives for highway segment designations as shown in
any locally adopted land use or transportation plan or approved town or county
transportation plan or approved transportation policy.
4. Signal spacing concerns may be ameliorated in the following ways:
a. A proposed private road that may otherwise be considered for the installation of a
traffic signal may be replaced by an onsite route or a frontage road that directs traffic
to or from a nearby public road;
b. A private road that is being considered for traffic signal installation may be required
to connect to the existing or planned local road system to allow uses of surrounding
properties;
c. An existing or proposed intersection may be relocated; or
d. A shared private road may be required to serve the needs of the multiple properties.
5. A traffic signal progression analysis for all new, revised or planned traffic signal systems
on state highways shall be performed using methods, models, computer software, data
sources, roadway segment length, and assumptions approved by the town's reviewing
staff. The roadway segment, analyzed to the extent possible, shall include all traffic
signals in the existing or future traffic signal system. The progression analysis shall:
a. Demonstrate acceptable existing and future traffic signal systems operation that may
include the morning peak, evening peak, midday period, and other appropriate time
period during any day of the week adjusted for peak season, for cycle lengths and
travel speeds approved by the town's reviewing staff;
b. Provide for a progressed traffic band speed no more than five (5) mph (eight (8)
km/h) below the existing posted speed for both directions of travel during the offpeak
periods, nor more than ten (10) mph (sixteen (16) km/h) below the existing
posted speed during peak periods. Approval by the town's reviewing staff is
required where speeds deviate more than the above;
c. Demonstrate sufficient vehicle storage is available at all locations within the traffic
signal system without encroaching on the functional boundaries of adjacent lanes
and signalized intersections. The functional boundary of an intersection shall be
determined in discussion with the town's reviewing staff based on existing or
projected conditions;
d. Provide a common cycle length with adequate pedestrian crossing times at all
signalized intersections; and
e. Provide a progression bandwidth as large as that required, or as presently existing,
for through traffic on the federal or state highway at the most critical intersection
within the roadway segment. The most critical intersection is the intersection
carrying the highest through volume per lane on the federal or state highway.
6. The traffic signal progression analysis shall be supplemented by a traffic engineering
report that also considers highway capacity and safety of the roadway segment under
consideration. Traffic volumes, intersection geometry and lane balance considered at all
locations shall be appropriate for the present and future conditions. Present and future
conditions are usually considered to include the year of completion, and five (5) years
Specific to Subdivision 2.5.80
The Port Royal Code 2-61
into the future.
7. A clear and concise summary of recommended improvements that can serve as an
executive summary is required.
E. Traffic impact analysis plan review. The town's reviewing staff shall review all traffic impact
analysis plans as part of the initial approval for the concept plan or master plan. Final traffic
impact analysis plans shall be approved at the development plan phase.
F. Application. A traffic impact analysis plan shall be submitted to the town's reviewing staff.
Coordination with other entities in the county government or South Carolina Department of
Transportation (SCDOT) shall be the responsibility of the town.
G. Action on traffic impact analysis plan. The town's reviewing staff must first approve the TIA
in regard to completeness and accuracy. Following review of the required impact analysis
plan, reviewing staff shall recommend action as follows:
1. Approval of the traffic impact analysis as submitted;
2. Approval of the traffic impact analysis plan with conditions or modifications as part of
the development review and approval process. An acceptable traffic impact analysis plan
with traffic mitigation measures may include the reduction of the density or intensity of
the proposed development; phasing of the proposed development to coincide with state
and/or county-programmed transportation improvements; applicant provided
transportation improvements; fees in lieu of construction, or any other reasonable
measures to insure that the adopted traffic service level goals are met. If mitigation is
required, it shall be required as a condition of any approval from the town.
H. Timing of implementation. If a traffic mitigation program is part of an approved traffic
impact analysis plan, the developer may be required to place a performance bond on all
traffic mitigation improvements required as a result of his project. This requirement may
arise if the timing of the improvements needs to be synchronized with other scheduled
improvements anticipated for the area.
I. Responsibility for costs of improvements. The costs of implementation of an approved
mitigation program shall be the responsibility of the applicant. No certificates of zoning
compliance or building permits shall be issued unless provisions of the transportation
impact analysis are met.
J. Traffic goals. The average stop time delay in seconds per vehicle for each intersection
determined to be critical to the traffic impact analysis for the proposed development shall
be compared to the town's adopted traffic service level goal of "D" for the average delay
for all vehicles at any signalized intersection during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

3.1.10 Purpose
This Division establishes the zones applied to property within the Town and adopts the Towns
Zoning Map.
3.1.20 Establishment of Zones
A. Zoning Map. The Town Council hereby adopts the Town of Port Royal Zoning Map
(hereafter referred to as the Zoning Map), which is on file with Town staff. See Division 1.5
(Official Zoning Map). The Zoning Map is hereby incorporated into this Development Code
by reference as though it were fully included here.
B. Zones Established. The Town of Port Royal shall be divided into transect zones and overlay
zones that implement the Comprehensive Plan. The zones in this Division are hereby
established, and shall be shown on the Zoning Map.
C. Interpretation of Zone Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any of
the zones shown on the Zoning Map or maps, the Planning Commission, upon written
application or upon its own motion, shall determine the location of such boundaries on said
Zoning Map or maps. All dedicated public streets within the County shall be zoned.
3.1.30 Transect Zones
The transect zones are described in Division 3.2 (Transect Zones). They primarily focus on mixeduse,
walkable areas of the Town and range in function and density from primarily residential
areas with a mix of building types (e.g. T3 Neighborhood), to medium density neighborhoods and
other commercial and retail areas (e.g. T4 Neighborhood Center).
3.1.40 Overlay Zones
The overlay zone standards are described in Division 3.3 (Overlay Zones). Overlay zones include
areas of the Town that are subject to additional design standards or limitations, such as the
Airport MCAS Overlay or Historic Preservation Overlay.
3.1.50 How Building Height is Measured
A. Determining Overall Building Height. Building height shall be measured in number of
stories from the natural grade or finished grade adjacent to the building exterior to the highest
point of coping of a flat roof, the top of a mansard roof, or the highest point of the highest
pitched roof.
3.1.50 Establishment and Designation of Zones
3-2 The Port Royal Code
B. Determining the Maximum Number of Stories Permitted. The maximum number of stories
(floors) allowed in a building is established by Transect Zone in Division 3.2.
C. Determining the Height of each Story. The following methodology shall be used to
determine the minimum and maximum height of each floor in a building.
1. Where applicable, minimum ground floor height and upper story height are established
by Transect Zone in Division 3.2.
2. Maximum ground floor height and upper story height are established in Table 3.1.50.A
(Maximum Height of a Story) below. A story that exceeds these regulations shall be
counted as two or more stories.
Table 3.1.50.A: Maximum Height of a Story
Floor Location
Non-Residential
Multi-Family
Residential
Single and
Two-Family
Residential
Ground Floor 20' max. 16' max. 14' max.
Upper Story 12' max. 12' max. 12' max.
Notes:
All heights are measured finished floor to highest point of the finished ceiling.
Certain uses associated with Landmark Buildings may be exempt from maximum story height.
D. Ground floor Finish Level.
1. Where applicable, minimum and maximum ground floor finish level (measured from
adjacent finished grade) are established by Transect Zone in Division 3.2.
2. Ground floor finish level for Single, Two-Family, or Multi-Family Residential building
types shall be a minimum of 18 and a maximum of 5 feet (measured from adjacent
finished grade). Where maximum ground floor finish level exceeds this height, the
undercroft (basement, crawl space, or storage area) shall count as a story.
E. Basement. Basements with an exterior exposed wall greater than five feet tall (measured from
the adjacent finished grade to the finished floor of the story above) shall count as a story.
F. ½ Story. A 1/2 story is the top floor of a building that
has a maximum exterior wall height not to exceed 6
feet, creating a sloped ceiling on the top level of the
structure. Dormers may be used to provide egress
windows as required by the adopted building code.
See Diagram 3.1.50.A (1/2 Story Depicted)
G. Appurtenances. Architectural, Mechanical, and
Structural Appurtenances may exceed the allowable
building height, and shall conform to the standards
for Appurtenances, as conveyed in the Building Form
Standards for each Transect Zone (see Division 3.2.
Transect Zones).
Diagram 3.1.50: ½ Story Depicted. (Credit: Lee Helena)
We Do This Because.
Measure Height By Stories: Regulating height by stories rather than feet allows developers to use taller floor-to-ceiling heights, which leads to
more efficient, aesthetically pleasing, and historically accurate buildings. This approach discourages developers from using minimal floor heights or
flatter roofs in order to force as many floors into a building as possible. Instead, the number of stories is limited, and the height of each story is
confined to a range. Designers are provided the flexibility necessary to create well-proportioned buildings that are tall enough to define the streetscape.

3.2.10 Purpose
This Division provides regulatory standards governing land use and building form within the
transect zones. The Form-Based Code is a reflection of the community vision for implementing the
intent of the Comprehensive Plan to preserve the Town of Port Royals character and create
walkable places. These standards are intended to ensure that proposed development is compatible
with existing and future development on neighboring properties, and produces an environment of
desirable character.
3.2.20 Applicability
The requirements of this Division shall apply to all proposed development within the transect
zones, and shall be considered in combination with the standards for specific uses in Article 4
(Specific to Use), and the development standards in Article 5 (Supplemental to Zones). If there is a

3.3.10 Purpose
This Division provides regulatory standards governing land use and building form within
special overlay zones. These zones are typically applied to certain areas of the Town where
extreme environmental, physical or cultural constraints need increased planning guidelines
and consideration.
3.3.20 Applicability
The requirements of this Division shall apply to all proposed development within the overlay
zones, and shall be considered in combination with the standards for specific uses in Article 4
(Specific to Use), if applicable, and the development standards in Article 5 (Supplemental to
Zones). If there is a conflict between any standards, the provisions of Article 4 (Specific to
Use) control over Article 3 (Specific to Zones) and Article 5 (Supplemental to Zones).

3.3.30 Military Overlay (MO) Zone Standards
A. Purpose
The Military Overlay (MO) Zone is applied to existing military
bases and Department of Defense lands, and provides for
military facilities and all supporting activities such as housing,
offices, and services that are on base land, even though they
would otherwise be considered separate uses. Military
property is under jurisdiction of the federal government.
Recommendations and standards for this Zone are not
included in this Division, since these lands are federally owned,
and are typically not subject to Town regulations.
B. Allowed Land Uses
Any use which is integral or compatible to the principal
operation located within the MO Zone, provided that such
use is authorized and under the control of the responsible
governmental agency owning the land or operating the facility
or installation, and provided that such use is determined by
the responsible governmental agency not to be contrary to
the public welfare.
C. Other Requirements
Allowed uses may be located in the MO Zone subject to such
requirements and regulations as deemed necessary by the
governmental agency responsible for their operation to
assure their most effective utilization in terms of the overall
functioning of the installation or facility and in terms of
insuring the best interests of the general public.

3-44 The Port Royal Code
Historic Preservation Overlay (HPO) Zone Standards
F. Review  Certificate of Appropriateness (cont.) G. Demolition or Relocation
(continued from previous page)
b. Construction and Alteration. In
reviewing an application for construction or
alteration, the HPC and the Administrator
shall consider general design, character and
appropriateness of design, scale of buildings,
texture and materials, relationship of such
elements to similar features of structures in
the immediate area, and the extent to which
the alteration or construction would be
harmonious with the historic district in
which it is located or with the landmark. The
HPC and the Administrator also shall
consider the relevant standards and
guidelines in the most current edition of the
U.S. secretary of the interior's standards for
rehabilitation.
c. Demolition. In reviewing an application for
demolition, the HPC and the planning
director shall consider the historical,
archeological, and aesthetic character of the
structure (or portion thereof) proposed for
demolition. They shall also consider: (1) the
structural integrity (i.e. condition) of the
structure and (2) the integrity of materials,
location, and design of the structure. No
application for demolition shall be approved
solely on the basis of a structure's
deteriorated condition where the
commission determines that the applicant is
primarily responsible for the deteriorated
condition. Finally, the HPC shall consider the
extent to which demolition would, in the
judgment of the HPC, produce a detrimental
effect upon the character of the structure or
property affected or upon the surrounding
properties, or upon the district in which the
structure is located. No application for
demolition of a Landmark shall be approved.
d. Specific Guidelines. The Commission shall
adopt additional guidelines, subject to review
and approval by town council, consistent
with this article for reviewing applications for
a Certificate of Appropriateness.
9. Re-filing of an Application. If an application of
a certificate of appropriateness is denied, the
application may not be considered by the HPC
again for one (1) year unless the applicant can
demonstrate to the HPC a substantial change in
circumstances relevant to the application.
1. Certificate of Appropriateness Required.
a. No structure within a historic district or
landmark shall be demolished or relocated
until he owner thereof has applied for and
received a certificate of appropriateness from
the HPC.
b. The HPC may delay the granting of the
Certificate for a period of up to one hundred
eighty (180) days from the time of the filing
of the application. The HPC may extend this
postponement for another one hundred
eighty (180) days after a public hearing and
finding by the HPC that the structure or
landmark is of historical, architectural, or
archeological importance to the public or
town. Within any period of postponement,
the commission shall endeavor to ascertain
what may be done to preserve the structure
or landmark. Such steps shall include, but are
not limited to, consultation with civic groups,
interested citizens, public interest groups,
and public boards and agencies.
c. After the postponement period has ended
and the commission has been unable to
determine a reasonable alternative to
demolition or relocation, the certificate shall
be granted after a public hearing, with the
notice required by subsection 22-242(d)
being given. However, if the commission
finds that the structure contributes to the
character of the historic district or that the
landmark is of historical, archeological, or
architectural significance or that, for any
other reason, preservation in the public
interest is warranted, the application shall be
denied. In the event of such denial, the
owner may apply for an exception under
section 22-244.

2. Demolition by neglect.
a. Prevention of Demolition by Neglect of
Exterior. No owner or person with an
interest in real property which is designated
a landmark in any part of the town or any
property in an historic district, whether that
property is occupied or not, shall permit the
structure or property to fall into a serious
state of disrepair or to remain in a serious
state of disrepair so as to result in the
deterioration of any exterior architectural
feature which would, in the judgment of the
HPC, produce a detrimental effect upon the
character of the structure or property, or, if
the structure or property is in an historic
district, upon the district. Examples of such
deterioration include:
(1) Deterioration of exterior walls or other
vertical supports;
(2) Deterioration of roofs or other
horizontal members;
(3) Deterioration of exterior chimneys;
(4) Deterioration of crumbling of exterior
stucco or mortar;
(5) Ineffective waterproofing of exterior
walls, roofs or foundations, including
broken windows or doors;
(6) Deterioration of any exterior feature so
as to create a hazardous condition
which could make demolition necessary
for the public safety; or
(7) Deterioration or removal of any unique
exterior architectural feature which
would detract from the original
architectural style.
b. Prevention of Demolition by Neglect of
Interior. No owner or person with an
interest in real property which is designated
a landmark in any part of the town, or any
property in an historic district, whether that
property is occupied or not, shall permit the
interior portions of such structure or
property to fall into a serious state of
disrepair which, in the judgment of the HPC,
produces a detrimental effect upon the
structural integrity of such structure or
property which could make demolition
necessary for the public safety.
1. Submission Requirements. If an application
for a certificate of appropriateness is denied by
the HPC, the applicant may request that the
application be reviewed for economic hardship
pursuant to this section. The commission may
obtain expert testimony and require the
applicant make submissions concerning the
following information before the commission
makes a final determination on the application.
a. Estimate the cost of the proposed
construction, alteration, demolition, or
relocation and an estimate of any additional
cost that would be incurred to comply with
the recommendations or directives of the
commission for changes necessary for
issuance of a certificate.
b. A report from a licensed engineer or
architect with experience in rehabilitation on
the structural soundness of any structures
and their suitability for rehabilitation.
c. Estimated market value of the property
under the following conditions: in its current
condition; after completion of the proposed
construction, alteration, demolition, or
relocation; after any changes recommended
or directed by the commission; and, in the
case of a proposed demolition, or relocation,
after renovation of the existing property for
continued use. The commission may require
that these estimates be prepared by a
qualified expert.
d. In the case of a proposed demolition or
relocation, an estimate from an architect,
developer, real estate consultant, appraiser,
or other real estate professional experienced
in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility
of continued use, rehabilitation, or reuse of
the existing structure at its current location.
e. Amount paid for the property, the date of
purchase, and the party from whom
purchased, including a description of the
relationship, in any, between the owner-ofrecord
or applicant and the person from
whom the property was or is to be
purchased, and the terms of financing.
f. If the property is income-producing, the
annual gross income from the property for
the previous two (2) calendar or fiscal years;
itemized operating and maintenance
expenses during the same period; and
depreciation, deduction, and annual cash flow
before and after debt service, if any, during
the same period.

H. Determination of Economic Hardship (cont.) I. Interpretation and Enforcement
(continued from previous page)
g. Any other information requested by the
commission in its discretion to reach a
determination as to whether the property
does yield or may yield a reasonable return
to the owners.
2. Review. The commission shall review all of the
evidence and information required from the
applicant, hold a public hearing, and make a
determination thereon within thirty (30) days
after receipt of all required information of
whether the denial of a certificate of
appropriateness will result in economic hardship
to the owner because he will be deprived of all
reasonable use of the property. If the
commission makes a determination that, in its
discretion, economic hardship has not been
proven by the applicant, the application for a
certificate of appropriateness based upon
economic hardship shall be denied. If the
commission determines, in its discretion, that
economic hardship would occur to the owner,
the commission may issue a certificate of
appropriateness based upon economic hardship
or delay action on the application for a period of
ninety (90) days If at the end of the 90-day
period, the commission finds, after a public
hearing with the notice required by subsection
22-242(d) being given, that without issuance of
the certificate of appropriateness, an economic
hardship would still occur, then the commission
shall issue a certificate of appropriateness based
upon economic hardship.
1. Interpretation. The Administrator shall
interpret the provisions of this article. Any final
interpretation by the planning director may be
appealed pursuant to the procedures at
subsection 22-242(j).
2. Enforcement.
a. The zoning official shall periodically inspect
work in progress under a certificate of
appropriateness.
b. In the event that this article or a certificate
of appropriateness is violated, the HPC,
zoning official, or building official may issue an
order requiring the person or persons
committing the violation to cease and desist
immediately there from. The cease-anddesist
order shall remain in effect until any
certificate of appropriateness required for
the work is approved.
c. A violation of a cease-and-desist order issued
by the HPC or the zoning official or building
official is hereby declared unlawful and shall
be punished as set forth in subsection (c).
3. Violations and Penalties. It shall be unlawful
for any person to violate any provisions of this
article, and any person violating these provisions
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
conviction, shall be punished by a fine not
exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) per
day. Each day that the violation of any provision
hereof continues shall constitute a separate
offense.

3.3.60 Manufactured Homes on Individual Lots Overlay (MHO) Zone Standards
A. Purpose Building Form
The purpose of the Manufactured Homes on Individual
Lots Overlay (MHO) Zone is to ensure affordable
housing options for a variety of residents while
promoting quality design principles that maintain the
character and value of the surrounding neighborhood.
1Floor Area of Unit: 800 sq. ft. min.
1Width: 22 ft. min.
Foundations shall allow permanent placement of every
manufactured home that complies with the building code.
B. Applicability 1Exclusive of private frontage, garage, or outbuilding.
The Manufactured Homes on Individual Lots Overlay
(MHO) Zone applies to specific areas of the Town,
delineated on the Official Zoning Map, in which base
zoning currently exists and new manufactured homes
shall be permitted. The Overlay is intended for
individual manufactured homes sited on individual lots,
as opposed to the establishment of a manufactured
home community, which is not permitted in the Town.
Architecture
Table 5.4.40 (Lowcountry Vernacular) depicts the basic
massing and elevation of a manufactured home.
To the maximum extent practicable, manufactured homes
shall be designed as conveyed in the provisions of Division
5.4 (Architectural Standards and Guidelines).
The Administrator shall have the right to adjust or waive
any standard that cannot be met without significantly
disrupting the integrity of the structure.
C. Requirements
To the maximum extent practicable manufactured
homes shall be regulated using the existing provisions of
this ordinance.
Zoning
To the maximum extent practicable, the underlying
zoning district shall determine:
1. Building Type
2. Building Placement
3. Building Form
4. Encroachments and Private Frontage Types
5. Parking
6. Uses
Building Type
Manufactured homes may be reviewed as a Compact
House, Medium House, or Large House Building Type
(see Division 5.1 Building Type Standards).
Building Orientation
The Private Frontage shall front the street or public
thoroughfare and determine the orientation of the
structure (see Division 5.3 Private Frontage Standards).
Generally, the maximum width permitted for the Main
Body of the building (see Division 5.1 Building Type
Standards) will result in the narrow end of the
manufactured home fronting the street or public
thoroughfare. Table 5.4.40 (Lowcountry Vernacular)
depicts the massing and elevation of a manufactured
home with a sideyard porch oriented in this manner.
In order to ensure that the private frontage always
addresses the street or public thoroughfare, a structure
that otherwise conforms with all required setbacks may
exceed the maximum width permitted for the Main
Body of the building and orient its wide end toward
the front of the lot.

4.1.10 Purpose
A. This Division establishes the:
1. Principal Uses permitted in each zoning district;
2. Corresponding Definitions with Examples, Accessory Uses, and Uses Not Included.
3. Additional regulations regarding site planning, development, and operating standards
intended to ensure compatibility with neighboring uses and the surrounding community.
B. This Division continues, and expands upon the Towns commitment to establishing mixeduse
neighborhoods comprised of multi-use buildings.
4.1.20 Applicability
A. Use Permission Defined. The Use Table in Section 4.1.30 affords 1 of 4 types of permission to
each use in each zoning district as follows:
1. Permitted Use (P): The use is permitted by right without any additional requirements in
this Article. Such uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this Ordinance.
2. Conditional Use (C): The use is permitted by right, provided that the additional use
regulations set forth in Division 4.2 (Conditional Use Regulations) are met, as well as all
other applicable regulations of this Ordinance.
Conditional Use Regulations are intended to insure that permitted uses are compatible
with neighboring uses and the surrounding community.
3. Special Exception (SE): The use is permitted only when a Special Exception Permit has
been approved. Special Exception Permits are required for uses which comply with the
Purpose established for the zoning district but which, because of their unique
characteristics or potential impacts on neighboring uses and/or the surrounding
community, require individual consideration in their location, design, configuration,
and/or operation. All applications for Special Exception Permits shall, at a minimum,
meet the standards for the district in which they are located, the additional standards set
forth in this Article for that use, and all other applicable regulations of this Ordinance.
Approval procedures for Special Exception Permits are found in Division 8.2.50 (Special
Exception Permit).
4. Prohibited Uses (): The use is prohibited in the specified District.
B. Mixed-use development and multi-use buildings are permitted and encouraged using the
individual standards for each function.

Additional Conditions) identifies the specific location of the additional regulations that apply
to a Conditional Use.
D. By Right Design Criteria. The last column of the Use Table (Additional Design Criteria)
identifies the location of additional design standards that frequently apply to a given use.
E. Accessory Uses. Accessory Uses that are regulated by zoning district are listed in the
Principal Use Table, including Accessory Dwelling Units and Home Occupations. Other
typical accessory uses are established and defined in Division 4.3 Accessory Uses and
structures.
F. Interpreting and Assigning the Appropriate Use.
1. Developments with Multiple Principal Uses: When all principal uses of a development
fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category.
When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each
principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all
applicable regulations for that category.
2. Similar Use Interpretation Criteria: The following considerations shall be used when
making similar use interpretations, including the appropriate category for a use not
specifically listed in the Principal Use Table or the Examples provided with the Principal
Use Definitions:
a. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated
definition for the Use.
b. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity;
c. Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
d. The customer type for each activity;
e. The relative number of employees in each activity;
f. Hours of operation;
g. Building and site arrangement;
h. Vehicles used with the activity;

5.1.10 Purpose
This Division sets forth standards that are applicable to the development of each building type, as
identified and permitted by zone (see Article 3 Specific to Zone). Standards are intended to ensure
development reinforces the highly-valued existing character and scale of the Town of Port Royal.
5.1.20 Applicability
A. The requirements of this Division shall apply to all proposed development, and shall be
considered in combination with the standards for the applicable zone in Article 3 (Specific to
Zones), the proposed use in Article 4 (Specific to Use), and the rest of this Article.
B. The vast majority of functions are suitable for one or more building types found in this
Division. However, in very specific cases the physical form of a building is a direct result of its
use (e.g. civic buildings, gas stations, transportation terminals, parking garages). Such
structures are referred to as Exceptional Buildings, and are addressed in Division 5.2
(Exceptional Building Types).
5.1.30 Building Types Overview
This Section provides an overview of the allowed building types.
A. Table 5.1.30.A (Traditional Building Types) provides an overview of the allowed building types.
B. The names of the building types are not intended to limit uses within a building type. For
example, a single-family house may have non-residential uses such as home occupation uses
or service uses when permitted within the zone.
C. The lot size standards for each building type designate the range of lot sizes that the given
building type is allowed to be built on. If the lot is smaller or larger than the allowed lot size, a
different building type shall be selected.
D. When minimum lot sizes are established in Article 3 (Specific to Zones), those minimum lot
sizes shall govern.
5.1.30 Traditional Building Types
5-2 The Port Royal Code
Table 5.1.30.A: Traditional Building Types
Illustration Building Type Allowed In
Carriage House: This building type is a secondary structure typically
located at the rear of a lot. This structure frequently provides either a small
residential unit, home office space, or other small commercial or service
use that may be above a garage or at ground level. This building type is
important for providing affordable housing opportunities and incubating
small businesses within walkable neighborhoods.
Detached House  Large. This building type is a large detached
structure on a large lot that incorporates one unit. It is typically located
within a primarily single-family residential neighborhood in a sub-urban or
rural setting. If located within a walkable neighborhood, this building type is
often sited along the water, or in a manner that provides a transition to
more rural areas. While primarily used for single family housing, this
building type is appropriate for low intensity group living.
Detached House  Medium. This building type is a medium-sized
detached structure on a moderate-sized lot that incorporates one unit. It is
typically located within a primarily single-family residential neighborhood in
a walkable urban setting, potentially near a neighborhood main street.
While primarily used for single family housing, this building type is
appropriate for low intensity, non-residential uses.
Detached House  Compact. This building type is a compact, detached
structure on a small lot that incorporates one unit. This type allows for
appropriately-scaled, well-designed higher density housing within a primarily
single-family neighborhood, and is important for providing a broad choice
of detached housing types that promote walkability. While residential in
form, this building type is ideal for low intensity retail, service, and office
uses, and is often located near, or even on a neighborhood main street.
Cottage Court. This building type consists of a series of small, detached
structures on a single lot, providing multiple units arranged to define a
shared court that is typically perpendicular to the street. The shared court
takes the place of a private rear yard and becomes an important
community-enhancing space. The Cottage Court allows for the
introduction of appropriately-scaled medium density, detached housing
within a single-family neighborhood, and is important for providing a broad
choice of housing types that promote walkability. While residential in form,
this building type allows for the establishment of a single-lot cluster of
buildings dedicated to retail, the arts, education, and similar uses.

Table 5.1.30.A: Traditional Building Types
Illustration Building Type Allowed In
Duplex. This building type is a small to medium-sized structure that
consists of two side-by-side or two stacked dwelling units, both facing
the street. The Duplex is appropriately scaled, and designed to appear
as a moderate to large single-family home, allowing for the introduction
of medium density housing within a primarily detached single-family
neighborhood. This type is important for providing a broad choice of
housing options that promote walkability. While residential in form, this
building type is appropriate for low intensity retail, service, and office
uses.
Townhouse. This building type is a small to medium-sized attached
structure that consists of three or more dwelling units placed side-by-side.
This type is typically located within medium-density neighborhoods or in a
location that transitions from a primarily single-family neighborhood into a
neighborhood main street. This building type is critical to the effort to
provide a broad choice of housing types that promote walkability. While
primarily residential in form, this type may be used for live-work and
similar medium intensity retail, service, and office uses. Syn: Rowhouse.
Mansion Apartment. This building type is a medium structure that
consists of three to six side-by-side and/or stacked dwelling units, typically
with one shared entry or individual entries along the front. This type has
the appearance of a medium-sized family home and is appropriately scaled
to fit in sparingly within primarily single-family neighborhoods or mediumdensity
neighborhoods. This building type is critical to the effort to
provide a broad choice of housing types that promote walkability. While
residential in form, this building type may be appropriate for office,
medical, lodging, and similar uses.
Apartment House. This building type is a medium-to-large-sized
structure that consists of 7 to 12 side-by-side and/or stacked dwelling
units, typically with one shared entry. This type is appropriately-scaled to
fit within medium-density neighborhoods or sparingly within large lot
predominantly singly-family neighborhoods. This building type is critical to
the effort to provide a broad choice of housing types that promote
walkability. Buildings shall not be constructed as isolated complexes but
rather integrated into the neighborhood block and street system. While
residential in form, this building type may be appropriate for office,
medical, lodging, and similar uses.
Flex Building. This building type is a medium to large-sized detached
structure of one to two-and-a-half stories with a storefront treatment that
most often accommodates commercial, recreational entertainment, light
industrial, and other uses that are too large or intense to be appropriately
housed in a residential or Main Street Mixed-Use building type. This
building is inspired by the large vernacular prototypes of the lowcountry,
including: packing sheds, barns, warehouses, and maritime structures. The
front façade is typically flat, often with a Shopfront or Gallery frontage.
This type is a primary component of an urban flexible neighborhood that
provides a mix of buildings, and is often located along significant
thoroughfares.
Main Street Mixed-Use. This building type is a small- to medium-sized
structure, typically attached, intended to provide a vertical mix of uses
with ground-floor commercial, service, or retail uses and upper-floor
commercial, service, or residential uses. Smaller versions of this type
include live/work units. This type makes up the primary component of a
neighborhood main street and portions of a downtown main street, and is
critical to providing a walkable environment.

stories with a storefront treatment that most often
accommodates commercial, recreational entertainment,
light industrial, and other uses that are too large or
intense to be appropriately housed in a residential or
Main Street Mixed-Use building type. This building is
inspired by the large vernacular prototypes of the
lowcountry, including: packing sheds, barns,
warehouses, and maritime structures. The front façade
is typically flat, often with a Shopfront or Gallery
frontage. This Type is a primary component of an urban
flexible neighborhood that provides a mix of buildings,
and is often located along significant thoroughfares.

5.2.10 Purpose.
Exceptional Buildings refer to a subset of Traditional Building Types in which the form of the
structure is primarily driven by its function or use. These provisions supplement the standards for
Traditional Buildings, and contain additional requirements regarding location, site planning, and
building design. At the community scale, these criteria ensure the continued establishment and
promotion of walkable places of value and meaning; while at the lot level, they maximize the
application of appropriately-scaled elements and features.
5.2.20 Applicability.
The requirements of this Division shall only apply to those uses listed with each Exceptional
Building Type. They shall be considered in combination with the standards of Division 5.1
(Traditional Building Types), the applicable zone in Article 3 (Specific to Zones), and the
provisions of this Division.

5.2.30 Landmark Buildings
A. Description
Landmark Building. Landmark Buildings are
designed for occupancy by public or commercial
uses that provide important services to the
community, including recreation, education, safety,
assembly, and related functions. They contribute
significantly to the quality of the neighborhood and
often serve as the focal point of a civic space,
terminate a vista, or are placed at a prominent
location. The architectural quality and construction
of a Landmark Building shall be of the highest level
and exceed that of nearby buildings.
Photographic Examples (above)
Top Row: Community Oriented Facilities  Beaufort City Hall,
Bluffton Library, Port Royal US Post Office (all of a formal, civic character)
Middle Row: Community Recreation Facility  Port Royal YMCA;
Community Safety Facility  Burton Fire Station (formal, civic character);
Public School  Port Royal Elementary School (formal, civic character)
Bottom Row: Community Oriented Facilities  National Cemetery,
Beaufort (informal, residential character); Meeting Facility or Place of
Worship Union Church, Port Royal (small scale, semi-formal character);
First Presbyterian Church Beaufort (medium scale, semi-formal residential
character); Baptist Church of Beaufort (large scale, formal character)
B. Allowed in Transect Zones

Exceptional Building Types 5.2.30
The Port Royal Code 5-29
D. Review Process
All Landmark Buildings shall be reviewed for design on a
case-by case basis using, to the maximum extent practicable,
the standards of this Code.
Existing Building Types
The following facilities may be designed to an existing
building type found in Division 5.1 (Traditional Building
Types).
1. Private and quasi-public meeting facilities.
2. Minor or secondary recreation and safety facilities.
3. Small to medium scaled transportation facilities in
which passenger boarding occurs outside the building.
All other buildings, regardless of scale, shall be designed as
remarkable landmark structures that stand out.
E. Building Location
The following criteria should be considered when
determining the location of a Landmark Building within the
community, on the block, and on the lot:
1. Primary function
2. Perceived level of importance to the community
3. Desired level of formality
4. Sense of permanence
Location Within the Community
To the maximum extent practicable, buildings shall be sited
at prominent locations and oriented toward a public street
or public space in a manner that:
1. Provides a corner or midblock terminating vista; or
2. Anchors a civic space; or
3. Fronts a street and civic space.
Location on the Block
Structures that draw inspiration from an existing building
type may be integrated into the urban fabric or
streetscape with little to no additional emphasis.
All other Landmark Buildings shall be designed as
freestanding, monumental structures that evoke pride in
ones community and convey a sense of timelessness.
Location On the Lot
Setback
Landmark Buildings often benefit from being set back from
the adjacent build-to lines of private development,
thereby:
1. Allowing the scale of the building to have more visual
emphasis; and
2. Creating a public space in the foreground.
The amount of this setback should be carefully determined
based on programming and the urban design objectives of
the particular site.
Multiple Buildings / Campus
Facilities with multiple buildings or a campus-like setting
shall comply with the standards of Section 2.2.100 (Multibuilding
Development).
F. Vehicle Access and Parking.
To the Maximum Extent Practicable:
Parking shall not be located between a principal or
secondary façade and a primary or secondary street.
Parking requirements for the site shall be met with onstreet
parallel and angled parking spaces, or via a remote
parking lot or structure.
Parking shall be accessed from a side street or alley
Parking drives and access shall be shared on adjacent lots.
Drop-off, pick-up, and associated stacking for the site shall
occur on or along a public street.
Building is Sited in a Public Space:
Vehicular access shall be limited to service and emergency
vehicle access, provided through pedestrian walkways of
sufficient width and construction.
G. Building Design
Facades and Entrances
The façade that fronts the primary street (or waterway)
shall be considered to be the buildings principal façade,
and the façade that fronts the secondary street shall be
considered to be the buildings secondary facade.
1. The principal façade shall be designed to be the most
prominent façade of the building.
2. Building entrances shall always take access from the
most prominent façades.
3. Additional entrances may be provided along secondary
and auxillary facades.
Required Frontages
Porch, Projecting Forecourt Arcade
Stoop Gallery
Per Division 5.3 (Private Frontage Standards)
These frontages are applicable to any zoning district, as
conveyed in Sub-section 5.3.30.B (Exception).
Architecture
To the Maximum Extent Practicable:
The architectural provisions of Division 5.4 (Architectural
Standards and Guidelines) shall be used to determine the
level of formality; as well as all details not explicitly
covered in this Section.
Massing
Primary Massing
Symmetrical in form
The appearance of a balanced design increases the level of
formality, and shall be encouraged.
Massing, while often larger as a whole, should be divided
into visually distinct sections.
Massing divisions should provide visual order to the
building and create vertical proportions within individual
elements.
On a Corner Lot
Landmark Buildings shall be designed with two façades of
equal, though not identical architectural quality.
5.2.30 Exceptional Building Types
5-30 The Port Royal Code
Massing (continued)
In a Civic Space
Landmark Buildings located in a civic space shall be
designed with four façades of architectural quality.
Scale
Size
In order to be more prominent and visible across greater
distances, the scale of the building should be larger than
that of corresponding buildings.
Stories
Floor-to-ceiling heights and architectural details should be
proportionately larger than those of private buildings that
exist or are anticipated within adjacent blocks.
Roof Appurtenances
Prominent roof forms and additive elements such as
spires, steeples, towers, cupolas, and belfries can visually
extend the height of the building, and shall be
incorporated when practicable.
Materials
Buildings shall use durable, high quality materials that
convey a sense of permanence. These include, but are not
limited to brick, stone, and cast concrete.
Wood
In some cases wood construction is appropriate, but
should only be executed with the highest quality framing
and cladding materials.
Stucco
Stucco should be avoided as a material that lacks scale and
texture. If used, stucco should be traditional, have integral
pigment, and be scored to define human-scaled dimensions
on the façade.
Details
Building details should be designed at two scales. At the
larger scale, details should be prominent to read from a
distance. Closer to the building, the details of the lower
levels should have another measure of refinement that can
only be seen at the up-close, pedestrian scale.
H. Specific to Public Schools
In Addition to A-G Above:
Campus Location
Schools should be embedded within, and sited to the edge
of the neighborhood.
Campus Size
Elementary School shall not exceed 5 acres
Middle School shall not exceed 10 acres
High School shall not exceed 15 acres
Schools combining grade levels from more than one
category may use the grade level with the higher allowable
acreage.
J. Specific to Public Schools (continued)
Shared Facilities with the Community
To the maximum extent practicable outdoor recreation
facilities (playgrounds, courts, athletic fields) on campus
shall be integrated within a shared civic space. This shared
recreation / civic space shall count towards the minimum
Open Space requirement for the school and the
surrounding Community. Natural Resource requirements
may also be fulfilled using the shared space.
Facilities on the school campus for which there is a formal
joint-use agreement with another entity, such as athletic
facilities, playgrounds, and multipurpose spaces in buildings,
may be deducted from the total site area of the campus.
K. Specific to Churches
In Addition to A-G Above:
Church Buildings
Traditional Design. A church should be easily identifiable
with timeless features such as bell towers, steeples,
clearstory windows, and stained glass integrated into the
design. Traditionally designed buildings can be navigated
easily based on intuition without much signage. For
example, if you need a sign or large cross to tell people that
they are in the Sanctuary then the design can be improved.
Vertical Massing. The scale of the sanctuary building
should not overwhelm the block. Building features such as
arches, columns, pilasters, rooflines (including dormers),
and masonry patterns shall divide and create a vertical
orientation on larger surfaces. Once these proportions have
been established, windows (including clearstory) and doors
shall reinforce the vertical orientation of the composition.
Be Transparent. Being able to see and hear a little bit of
what's going on inside makes a church seem less
intimidating and peeks the interest of those passing by. This
is the same principal as window-shopping, only adapted to
a church. It is not uncommon for people to join a service
after hearing music wafting through the doors of a church.
Define Entrances. The churchs buildings should be open
and inviting, with a clear sense of where to enter. In no case
shall a churchs side doors function as a primary entry point.
Entrances Close to Pedestrians. If the church is in an
area even remotely urban use frontage elements such as
porches, stoops, galleries, arcades, and canopies to bring
the church up to the street or public space, while still
providing an area for people to gather.
Doors. Church doors should be prominent and inviting.
Church Campus
Parking. Parking lots disrupt the neighborhood fabric and
discourage members from walking to and from church,
resulting in less patronage of local shops and cafes. Parking
should be on-street, or shared with other commercial or
institutional buildings in the vicinity.
Create a Community Focal Point. Add neighborhoodfriendly
features such as athletic fields, tennis or basketball
courts, a playground, an outdoor amphitheater, etc.
Permeable Campus. Churches that span more than one
block shall ensure that their campus is permeable, allowing
people to walk through the property using multiple routes.
Specific to Public Schools (continued)
civic space requirement for the school and the
development / community. Natural Resource
requirements may also be fulfilled using the shared space.
I. Specific to Churches
sanctuary Doors. Church doors should be prominent and inviting.

5.2.50 Large Footprint Building
A. Description
Large Footprint Building. A building type that
appropriately accommodates a large building
envelope devoted to a single use in excess of 35,000
sf. Large Footprint Buildings are required to provide
commercial, office, or residential liner space along
each facade that fronts a public street or space.
Those functions deemed applicable for a Large Footprint
Building are conducive to a walkable environment, and:
The use is inherently associated with long blank
exterior walls, requiring special treatment (i.e. parking
garage, movie theater, warehouse club, etc.); and / or
The use is associated with a single story structure
whose mass (20 to 30 ft tall) often equals that of a
standard 2-3 story building (e.g. department store,
building supply, grocery store, etc.),
While a multi-story format is encouraged, a single story
building with liners is equally beneficial to the public realm.
Allowed in Transect Zones

5.3.10 Purpose
This Division sets forth the standards applicable to the development of private frontages. Private
frontages are the components of a building that provide an important transition and interface
between the public realm (street and sidewalk) and the private realm (yard or building). These
standards supplement the standards for each zone that the frontage types are allowed within. For
each private frontage type, a description, a statement of the types intent, and design standards are
provided. These standards are intended to ensure development that reinforces the highly-valued
existing character and scale of the Town of Port Royal.
5.3.20 Applicability
These standards work in combination with the standards found in Article 3 (Specific to Zones),
Division 5.1 (Traditional Building Types), Division 5.2 (Exceptional Building Types), and are
applicable to all private frontages within transect zones.
5.3.30 Private Frontages Overview
A. Table 5.3.30.A (Private Frontages  General) provides an overview of the required private
frontage types.

5.4.10 Purpose
The purpose of this Division is as follows:
A. To provide standards and guidelines that achieve and promote a consistently high level of design for
the Towns most intense and most visible development; and
B. To encourage new and renovated buildings to reflect the distinct characteristics of the Town of Port
Royal and the lowcountry.
5.4.20 Applicability
A. The standards and guidelines in this Division should be used to promote, enhance, and maintain
walkable places of character, and to maximize the application of appropriately-scaled elements and
aesthetics. These provisions are applicable to::
1. All proposed development within the T4NC, T4NC-O, T4UC and T5 MS Zones.
2. All proposed development within the T1NP, T3E, T3SN, and T3N Zones except Single-Family
Detached and Two-Family Residential Uses.
B. Why All Applicants Should Review this Division. The design measures contained in this Division
embody the historic traditions and unique characteristics of Port Royals built form; a form that its
citizens have come to know and cherish.
Traditional design elements are not only aesthetically pleasing; they incorporate time-honored
strategies that are energy efficient and cost effective. Therefore, while technically not required, it is
strongly recommended that all applicants wishing to develop in the Town review these provisions.
C. Standards and Guidelines. This Division includes both standards and guidelines. Statements
predicated by the words "shall" or "must" are to be interpreted as standards. Statements predicated
by the words "should" or "may" are to be interpreted as guidelines.
5.4.30 General Architectural Standards
The purpose of this Section is to provide general architectural standards that result in a quality built
environment in keeping with the character of the Town. This is achieved by adhering to time-honored
architectural design principles and incorporating additional architectural elements that blend
harmoniously with the natural surroundings.
5.4.40 Architectural Standards and Guidelines
5-54 The Port Royal Code
A. Building Scale and Massing.
1. Compatibility with Surrounding Buildings. Building design shall take into account the
immediate off-site surrounding structures, and provide mass, height and building elevations, so
as to create substantially compatible scale with adjacent structures.
2. Building Massing. Buildings shall incorporate variations in wall heights, façade articulations
and varied roof planes and pitches. Wall planes shall be divided into modules that express
traditional dimensions such that a primary facade plane shall not exceed 75 feet in length. If a
wall plane exceeds this dimension, then a jog shall be provided to divide it into subordinate
elements each less than 75 feet in length.
B. Façade Features. Building façades shall be designed to provide visual interest through detail and
ornamentation that is viewed at both the immediate pedestrian level as well as from a distance.
1. Wall Planes. Wall planes shall be divided into smaller components by the arrangement of
windows and other facade articulation features, such as columns, pilasters, and canopies.
2. Entrances. The main entrance to a building shall be clearly identifiable and shall be oriented to
face a public street, internal street, or public space. Entrances shall incorporate design features
such as canopies, porticos, arcades, raised cornice parapets or peaked roof forms over the
doorways, arches, and display windows.
3. Vertical Articulation. For all multi-story buildings, the building elevations shall clearly reflect a
bottom (first) floor and its representative interior height, a middle ground consisting of all floors
above the first floor and a visually pronounced building top that consists of a defined cornice at
the top of the parapet roof section or at the transition of the sloped roof section.
C. Roofs
1. Concealing Rooftop Equipment. Where mechanical HVAC equipment, satellite dish structures,
and other equipment are located on a roof, the roof structure shall be designed to be tall enough
to completely conceal the equipment from any public street or space.
2. Building Articulation. Varied roof pitches and planes shall be used to break up the massing of
larger buildings. Long, unarticulated roofs are prohibited.
D. Accessory Buildings. To the maximum extent practicable, an accessory buildings color, siding, roof
pitch, window detailing, roofing materials, and foundation shall be compatible with the principal
building on the lot.
5.4.40 Architectural Expression and Formality
A. This Section reflects and summarizes the range of traditional architectural expression and formality
that occurs within the Town of Port Royal. Historically, architecture in more rural places has
generally been less formal, and characterized by vernacular treatments, including simple, low-slung
massing, wood detailing, and a muted color palette. Architecture in more urban places has generally
been more formal, characterized by more classical treatments, including vertically-proportioned
massing, detailing in masonry and stucco, and a broader range of colors.
B. Overview of Architectural Expression and Formality. There are three broad categories of
architectural expression distinguished in this section: Lowcountry Vernacular, Village Revival, and
Mainstreet Classical. Architectural expression can be applied with varying degrees of formality as
illustrated in Table 5.4.40.A. (Town of Port Royal Architectural Expression and Formality).
C. While additional architectural styles and precedents do exist, these three categories (Lowcountry
Vernacular, Village Revival, and Mainstreet Classical) represent the majority of elements
traditionally applied to development within the Town of Port Royal. Since regulatory differences are
Architectural Standards and Guidelines 5.4.40
The Port Royal Code 5-55
present amongst the three categories, it is strongly recommended that the applicant and
Administrator / Town Architect engage in a pre-application meeting prior to any submittal.
Ultimately, the Administrator / Town Architect shall determine whether a submittal is reviewed as
Lowcountry Vernacular, Village Revival, or Mainstreet Classical.

Table 5.4.40.B: Lowcountry Vernacular
A. Architectural Expression and Formality
Description
In rural and low intensity sub-urban areas, commercial
and multi-family buildings should reflect vernacular
rural forms. These include simple residential
prototypes, and agricultural prototypes, such as
packing sheds, barns, and warehouses. Essential
characteristics include:
1. Simple, 1 to 1.5 story rectangular massing,
with straight, gabled roof forms
2. Raised foundations
3. Simple eaves, often with exposed rafter tails
4. Simply detailed, broad, often wraparound
porches Shophouse prototype.
5. Predominantly wooden architectural vocabulary
6. Muted color palette, predominantly white or
off- white
7. South facing porches, large windows, and high
ceilings
Commercial Buildings
Commercial buildings are typically residential in
character with simple modifications to accommodate
commercial activities.
Multi-Family Buildings
Multi-family buildings appear as two or more units
that are configured to resemble a large single-family
house.
Mixed-Use or Larger Commercial Buildings
Mixed-use or larger commercial structures find
precedent in the vernacular packing sheds, barns, and
warehouses of the Lowcountry.
Residential Buildings
Residential structures find precedent in the
vernacular small cottages and narrow two story
houses of the Lowcountry.

B. Massing
General Massing
Buildings are typically simple combinations of one or
more rectangular forms.
Roofs
Roofs are typically simple, gable-end or hipped forms.
Simple commercial and multi-family buildings typically
have relatively steep slopes, ranging from 8 in 12 to
10 in 12. Larger commercial buildings may
have slopes from 4 in 12 to 8 in 12.
Shed (monopitch) roofs shall only be attached to the
principal building walls, with a minimum slope of 2 in
12.
Porch roofs may have a lower pitch with a minimum
slope of 3 in 12.
Applied Mansard roofs are not allowed.
Roof-Wall Connections
Eaves typically employ exposed rafter tails, with a
minimal fascia depth.
Roof overhangs shall have a minimum 1 overhang at
eave and rake.
Primary Walls
Primary walls should be clad in siding (wood or
cementitious). Siding may be horizontal lap, ship-lap,
or vertical board and batten.
Siding may be mitered at building corners or clad with
a minimum 4" trim board. Trim board is typically 6".
Exposed wood may be painted, stained, weathered,
or left natural.
Base
Primary walls should rest on a drip edge and water
table made from wood or cementitious boards over
foundation piers.
Foundation piers shall be no less than 12" square. If
the foundation is taller than 4 above grade, than the
foundation piers shall be no less than 16 square.
Crawlspace openings and the undercroft of
foundations, decks, and porches shall be framed
in with a 2" minimum recessed lattice, vertical pickets
and/or hogs pen pattern (wood or similar).

Roof Design: Roofs are the greatest source of potential
heat gain in the warmest months of the year when the
midday sun is directly overhead. A light- colored, reflective
roof surface is most effective in minimizing heat gain.

Overhangs: Roof overhangs on the south side of the house provide shade in the summer (when the sun is high in the
sky), and allow sunlight and warmth into the house during the winter (when the sun is at a lower altitude). Overhangs
also direct water away from the building and foundation, and protect pedestrians from sun and inclement weather.
We Do This Because.
Foundation: Just as human-beings contain a base, body, and top (feet, torso, head), so to should every building. The base of a building
is its Foundation, or the portion of the structure that makes contact with the earth. A Foundation conveys a sense of permanence,
strength, and contributes to the vertical proportion and symmetry.
Raised Foundation: Residential homes contain a raised foundation of piers and crawlspace, protecting the main body of the home
from flooding, while allowing air to circulate and prevent water damage or mold. Additionally, a raised foundation with porch or stoop
elevates residents (and windows) above the street, allowing for easy interaction with passerbys, while maintaining a sense of privacy.

Façade Composition
Building elevations are typically divided into simple
facade compositions of equal bays. Three, five, and
seven-bay compositions are predominant.
Windows
Windows are typically double hung with first story
windows taller than upper story windows.
Window openings shall have vertical proportions, or
may be square.
Windows shall be framed with a minimum 3.5" wood
or fiber cement trim.
All windows shall have a sill. The sill should not be
integrated into a "picture frame" surround.
Windows are typically vertically-proportioned and
multi-paned with exterior true or simulated muntins.
Window panes may be in a 1-over-1, 2-over-2, or
6-over-6 divided light pattern.
When windows are ganged together, a 3" minimum
mullion shall be between each individual window.
Shutters, when used, shall be sized equal to half the
width of the window, the same height as the window,
and shall be operable.
Doors
Doors shall have a trim surround with a 3.5"
minimum wood or fiber cement trim.
Panels and windows should be simple and rectilinear.
Transom windows are allowed.

We Do This Because.
Operable Shutters: Shutters are solid or slatted window covers that originated in Greece and were originally designed
for light control, ventilation, and protection from the elements in a tropical environment.
One of the very basic premises that all shutters should have is that they look like they could actually protect your windows.
That means that if they could be closed, they would cover the window. Too many houses are designed with windows that
were never intended to have shutters.
Aesthetically pleasing, operable exterior shutters provide shade, keeping the hot sun out and allowing cool breezes to
ventilate the building. Operable shutters also provide an additional level of household security; as well as enhanced weather
protection during storms and hurricane season. Shutters should only be used if they can perform one of these tasks.

Shopfronts
All regulations regarding windows and doors
described in this Section apply to windows and doors
that are a part of a shopfront assembly.
Shopfronts are typically composed of doors and
windows that are residential in character.
Shopfront infill assemblies shall be made of painted or
varnished wood, aluminum-clad wood, or painted
metal.
Porches, galleries, and awnings may be incorporated
into shop front designs.
See Section 5.3.100 (Shopfront) for more standards.
We Do This Because.
Expansive Shopfront Windows: Shopfront windows are expansive with
a high degree of transparency. This visually connects activities taking place
within the shop with those occurring on the sidewalk, promoting windowshopping
and other interaction. This differs from residential windows, which are
far more minimal and often raised, in keeping with the desire for privacy. A
streetscape of transparent and interesting Shopfronts increases pedestrian
activity and social engagement, benefitting all surrounding businesses.

Porches: Porches provide outdoor living space that is shaded from the sun and protected from the
elements; yet still permits breezes to infiltrate the body of the building. This helps to save energy and reduce
costs. Aesthetically, they provide architectural interest and delineate the buildings entrance. The Porch also
helps to transition the private and public realm, encouraging both neighborly and community interaction.
We Do This Because.
Traditional Materials: Elements such as wood, brick, stone, concrete, stucco, and tabby are derived from the earth and
provide a sense of connection with our environment, as they are more likely to me mined or farmed locally. Buildings comprised
of these materials can last for centuries, conveying a sense of authenticity, strength, and longevity. Furthermore, they can be
patched, painted, and repaired rather easily. While synthetic and highly processed materials such as vinyl, PVC, or aluminum may
be less expensive initially, or require less maintenance, they are not built for longevity. Ultimately they fail. When they do, they
must be replaced altogether. As a whole, this is far more costly and less sustainable than the use of Traditional Materials.

A. Architectural Expression and Formality
Description
In urban centers and established areas of community
outside the Town core, commercial and multi-family
buildings should reflect a combination of vernacular
and more formal architecture. These include more
formal residential prototypes utilized for commercial
purposes, and commercial and mixed-use prototypes
constructed of more permanent and durable
materials. Essential characteristics include:
1. Simple, 2 to 2.5 story massing, with predominantly
gabled or hipped roof forms, and some parapeted
roofs.
2. Raised or at-grade foundations. Simple Commercial Prototype.
3. Both enclosed eaves with simplified classical
detailing and exposed rafter ends are appropriate.
4. Multi-storied, wrap-around porches with simplified
classical detailing.
5. Mixed architectural vocabulary, utilizing wood,
stucco, and masonry.
6. Muted colors and materials, predominantly white
or off-white, with masonry tones and occasional
brighter accent colors.
Commercial Buildings
Commercial buildings are typically commercial in
character, appearing as detached, single-use
structures with parapetted or gabled, pedimented
roof forms, and formal storefronts.
Multi-Family Buildings Multi-family Prototype: Attached Rowhouses.
Multi-family buildings may appear as two or more
units that are configured to resemble a large singlefamily
house, or as attached rowhouses.
Mixed-Use or Larger Commercial Buildings
Mixed-use or larger commercial structures are
modest in scale, and appear as both detached
commercial buildings and attached, multi-story,
vertical mixed-use structures.
Residential Buildings
Residential structures find precedent in the vernacular
one and one half story cottages, narrow two story
houses with side porches, and estates of the
Lowcountry.
Mixed-use Prototype: Live/Work Shophouse.

We Do This Because.
Vertical Proportions: The
up-right human body is vertically
proportioned. Therefore, humanbeings
inherently relate to, and
view structures and elements with
vertical proportions as being
human-scaled. As such, all
buildings, spaces, and associated
openings (windows and doors)
should be vertically proportioned.
We Do This Because.
Symmetry: The up-right human
body is more or less symmetrical.
Human-beings inherently relate to
this quality, finding beauty and
logic in such composition.
Intuitively, this principle is
extended to other artistic efforts,
including architecture. Applied to
buildings, symmetry evokes a
sense of order and dignity that is
timeless, attractive, and loveable.

High Ceilings: High Ceilings
allow the hot air to rise above the
occupied areas, increasing human
comfort.

B. Massing
General Massing
Buildings are typically simple combinations of one or
more rectangular forms.
Roofs
Roofs are typically gabled or hipped.
Half stories are typically articulated utilizing gable
ends and dormers.
Simple commercial and multi-family buildings typically
have relatively steep slopes, ranging from 8 in 12 to
10 in 12. Larger commercial buildings may have
slopes from 4 in 12 to 8 in 12 or have flat roofs.
Porch roofs may have a lower pitch with a minimum
slope of 3 in 12.
Flat roofs shall provide a parapet to conceal all roof
areas/equipment from view of a public street or space.
Shed (monopitch) roofs shall only be attached to the
principal building walls, with a minimum slope of 2 in
12.
Applied Mansard roofs are not allowed.
Skylights shall be flat (non-bubble) only unless
concealed behind a parapet.
Roof-Wall Connections
Eaves typically utilize an enclosed cornice and
entablature with simplified classical detailing.
Roof overhangs shall have a minimum 1 overhang at
eave and rake.
Primary Walls
Primary walls may be clad in horizontal lap, ship-lap,
or vertical board and batten siding (wood or
cementitious), stucco, or brick.
Exposed wood shall be unpainted, painted, or stained.
Brick mortar joints shall be struck.
Stucco shall be smooth and sand finish only.
Two or more wall materials may be combined on one
facade only with the lighter material above the other,
more substantial material (e.g. wood above stucco or
masonry, or stucco above masonry).
Decorative moldings, cornices, or an applied ornament
of stone or cast concrete may be used to express the
vertical division between the base, body, and the top.
Cantilevers shall be supported by visible brackets
scaled as if they were supporting the weight of the
mass above.
Typical Closed Eave Detail
Typical Open Eave Detail
We Do This Because.
Dormers: The use of Dormers is strongly encouraged as both
a functional and decorative element. Aesthetically, Dormers
provide architectural interest and additional articulation along
the Roof. Functionally, they provide upper story spaces with
additional heated space, light and ventilation.
We Do This Because.
Walls: A well-insulated, properly constructed exterior wall can increase the comfort, efficiency, and health of a building. Traditional wood
framing remains the most common and accessible building system for houses. Framed houses, 2x6 optimum value engineered (OVE) with
structural sheathing, generally cost about the same as standard framed houses but have the added benefits of reducing framing time and
construction costs, conserving resources, decreasing annual energy expenses, and reducing the amount of lumber used in the exterior wall
while increasing insulation.

number of windows on the heat-intensive west side, in favor of larger windows that
provide greater ventilation and day lighting on the north and east sides. Doublehung
windows are ideal for ventilation, allowing cooler air to enter through the
raised bottom sash, while hot air escapes through the lowered upper sash.
On residential buildings and upper-stories too many windows can make walls
appear weak and unstable, and negate all benefits related to energy efficiency.

Galleries: A Gallery is a type of building frontage that is associated with commercial uses, and is permitted to
encroach upon the setback, or even into the Right Of Way (over the sidewalk). This space provides an immediate
transition between the private and public realm, allowing for window-shopping, dining, or other activities that
promote interaction at the street level. Like a porch, the space is shaded from the sun and protected from the
elements; yet still permits breezes to infiltrate the body of the building. This helps to save energy and reduce
costs. Aesthetically, the Gallery provides architectural interest and delineates the buildings entrance.

A. Architectural Expression and Formality
Description
Within urban centers commercial and multi-family
buildings should reflect a more formal and diverse
architectural expression. Prototypes include true
mixed- use buildings for commercial and residential
uses that are constructed of permanent and durable
materials. Essential characteristics include:
1. Simple, up to 4 stories, verticallyproportioned
massing, with predominantly flat
roofs finished in parapets or pediments.
2. At-grade foundations, with classically detailed base
in masonry or stucco.
3. Enclosed eaves with formal classical detailing, Commercial Prototype.
often incorporating dentils and/or brackets.
4. Multi-storied galleries.
5. Architectural vocabulary predominantly in
masonry and stucco.
6. A broad range of colors and natural materials.
Commercial Buildings
Commercial buildings are typically mixed-use in
character, appearing as attached, multi-story
structures with parapetted or pedimented roof forms
and formal storefronts.
Multi-Family Buildings
Multi-family buildings typically appear as attached
buildings that define the street wall, articulated with
portals and upper-story balconies.
Mixed-Use or Larger Commercial Buildings Multi-family Prototype.
Mixed-use buildings typically appear as attached,
multi-story structures that define the street wall, with
articulated ground floor storefronts and awnings or
multi-storied galleries that extend over the sidewalk.
Residential Buildings
Residential structures find precedent in the two
story homes, tall two and one half to three story
narrow homes of the Lowcountry.

B. Massing
General Massing
Buildings are typically simple combinations of one or
more rectangular forms.
Roofs
Roofs are typically flat, with some gabled or hipped.
Larger commercial buildings may have slopes from 4 in
12 to 8 in 12 or have flat roofs.
Flat roofs shall provide a parapet to conceal all roof
areas / equipment from view of a public street or space.
Applied Mansard roofs are not allowed.
Skylights shall be flat (non-bubble) only unless concealed
behind a parapet.
Roof-Wall Connections
Eaves typically utilize an enclosed cornice and
entablature with formal classical detailing, often
incorporating dentils and/or brackets.
Roof overhangs shall have a minimum 8 overhang at
eave and rake.
Primary Walls
Primary walls may be clad in stucco, or brick. Wood
siding may be utilized sparingly.
Exposed wood shall be painted or stained.
Brick mortar joints shall be struck.
Stucco shall be smooth and sand finish only.
The vertical delineation of wall materials should be used
sparingly. Two or more wall materials may be
combined on one façade only with the lighter material
above the other, more substantial material (e.g. wood
above stucco or masonry, or stucco above masonry).
Decorative moldings, cornices, or an applied ornament
of stone or cast concrete may be used to express the
vertical division between the base, the body, and the
top.
Cantilevers shall be supported by visible brackets scaled
as if they were supporting the weight of the mass above.

Parapet: Parapets are used for both aesthetic and functional
purposes. Functionally, the Parapet was originally used as a
means of fire protection (fire wall) between structures. More
recently, they have been used to reduce wind pressure,
especially during hurricanes and tornadoes. Today, they are
frequently used to screen unsightly roof-top items such as HVAC
equipment, compressors, vents, communications devises, etc.
from public view. Aesthetically, a Parapet is frequently used as a
means of establishing correct proportions on the structure.

We Do This Because.
Arcades: Arcades function similarly to Galleries; however, the upper
stories are enclosed and heated, providing livable space that is
deemed to be part of the frontage as opposed to the main building.
In locations where Arcades encroach into the Right Of Way, this
space may occupy the area above the public sidewalk. This is a
significant bonus and provides strong incentive to use the Arcade. The
Arcade provides an immediate transition between the private and
public realm, allowing for window-shopping, dining, or other activities
that promote interaction at the street level. (continued).

a. Pergolas, Arbors, Trellises. Architectural features that are both functional and
compatible with the fence or wall are exempt from the height restrictions of this
Section.
b. Required Screening. A fence or wall utilized to meet the standards of Division 4.2
(Conditional Use Regulations), Division 5.2 (Exceptional Building Types), or
Division 5.7 (Landscaping and Screening), is exempted from the height standards of
this Section, but in no case shall the fence or wall exceed a height of ten feet.
c. Recreational Fencing. Customary fencing provided as a part of a permitted tennis
court, athletic field, or other recreational facility shall be exempt from the height
restrictions of this Section.
d. Public Safety Use Fences and Walls. Major utilities, wireless communication
towers, government facilities, and other public safety uses shall be allowed to
increase maximum fence or wall heights to 10 feet in front, side, and rear yards,
unless further increased through an approved security plan (see Subsection e.
below).
e. Security Plan for Fences and Walls. A property owner may submit a site security
plan to the Administrator that proposes fences or walls taller than those permitted
by this Section, or the use of barbed or concertina wire atop a fence or wall. The
Administrator may approve, or approve with conditions, the site security plan if:
(1) The condition, location, or use of the land, or the history of activity in the area,
indicates the land or any materials stored or used on it are in significantly
greater danger of theft or damage than surrounding land; and
(2) The proposed taller fences or walls, or use of barbed or concertina wire, will
not have a significant adverse effect on the security, functioning, appearance, or
value of adjacent lands or the surrounding area as a whole.

3. Reductions Based on a Parking Study.
a. The Administrator may grant a reduction in the parking requirements set forth in this
Section based upon the findings of a parking study submitted by the applicant that
provides an analysis of peak parking demand for the entire development and that
justifies a parking reduction. A reduction may be granted in the following cases:
(1) When three or more use types share parking;
(2) When a use type is not listed in Table 5.6.30.B (Shared Parking Factor for Two
Uses);
(3) When uses in the same or adjoining development have different peak hour
parking demand and seek to share parking;
(4) When the lot and use is adjacent to a thoroughfare with dedicated on-street
parking spaces that may potentially count towards the uses required parking
(Single-Family Residential, Two-Family Residential, and Accessory Dwelling
Units are excluded);
(5) When the lot and use are located within ¼ mile of a public parking facility;
(6) Where the special nature of a certain development (e.g. a small scale amphitheater
with on-street parking, or a housing project inhabited by persons with low or no
automobile ownership) does not require the amount of parking listed in
Subsection A (Minimum Number of Parking Spaces Required).
(7) Where fewer parking spaces are needed due to special designs and traffic
mitigation measures incorporated in the parking lot design and circulation plan.
5.6.40 Off-Street Parking
5-94 The Port Royal Code
In special cases off-street required parking may be reduced to zero.
b. The Administrator shall consider the following in determining whether a reduction is
warranted:
(1) The likelihood that the reduced number of parking spaces can satisfy demand;
(2) The amount of time during the year when the number of spaces provided may
be insufficient and the amount of resulting parking overflow;
(3) The impact of periodic overflows upon the public streets and other parking
facilities; and
(4) The nature of surrounding land uses, character of surrounding road system, and
nearby circulation pattern.
Unless requested by the Administrator, the burden to demonstrate that a reduction in
parking requirements is warranted shall rest with the applicant.
c. Bicycle Parking Substitution. Required vehicular parking spaces may be reduced at
a rate of one vehicular parking space for every one bicycle parking space provided
above the minimum provided in Section 5.6.50 (Bicycle Parking). Reduction in
parking shall not exceed a maximum of 20 percent of the required motor vehicle
parking spaces

such a way not to be construed as being more than one sign. Outcrops on signs are
prohibited.
7. Lighting. See Division 5.8 (Exterior Lighting), specifically Subsection 5.8.30.C.2
(Signage) for standards regarding appropriate light fixtures and illumination levels for

or brightness shall:
(1) Illuminate only the surface area of the sign;
(2) Not interfere with the safe vision of motorists or bicyclists as determined by
the building official. For spot-lit signs, the sign base and/or proposed
landscaping shall be designed to conceal the base of the light fixture to the
extent feasible.
b. Illuminated signs shall not have a light reflecting background, but may use

F. Sign Measurement Criteria.
1. Sign Area Measurement. Sign area for all sign types is measured as follows:
a. Sign copy mounted, affixed, or painted on a background panel or surface
distinctively painted, textured, or constructed as a background for the sign copy, is
measured as that area contained within the sum of the smallest rectangle(s) that
will enclose both the sign copy and the background. See Figure 5.9.40.A (Sign Area
for Signs on Background Panel and Signs with Individual Letters).
b. Sign copy mounted as individual letters or graphics against a wall, fascia,
mansard, or parapet of a building or surface of another structure, that has not been
painted, textured, or otherwise altered to provide a distinctive background for the
sign copy, is measured as a sum of the smallest rectangle(s) that will enclose each
word and each graphic in the total sign. See Figure 5.9.40.A (Sign Area for Signs on
Background Panel and Signs with Individual Letters).
c. Sign copy mounted, affixed, or painted on an illuminated surface or illuminated
element of a building or structure, is measured as the entire illuminated surface or
illuminated element, which contains sign copy. Such elements may include, but
are not limited to lit canopy fascia signs; spanner board signs; and/or interior lit
awnings. See Figure 5.9.40.A (Sign Area for Signs on Background Panel and Signs
with Individual Letters).
d. Multi-face Signs. Multi-face signs are measured as follows:
(1) Two face signs: if the interior angle between the two sign faces is 45 degrees or
less, the sign area is of one sign face only. If the angle between the two sign faces
5.9.40 Signs
5-118 The Port Royal Code
is greater than 45 degrees, the sign area is the sum of the areas of the two sign
faces. See Figure 5.9.40.B (Sign Area for Multi-face Signs or Free Form Signs).
(2) Three or four face signs: the sign area is 50 percent of the sum of the areas of
all sign faces. See figure on next page. See Figure 5.9.40.B (Sign Area for Multiface
Signs or Free Form Signs).
e. Free-form or Sculptural Signs. Spherical, free-form, sculptural or other non-planar
sign area is measured as 50 percent of the sum of the areas using only the four
vertical sides of the smallest four-sided polyhedron that will encompass the sign
structure, as shown in Figure 5.9.40.B (Sign Area for Multi-face Signs or Free Form
Signs).
Signs with greater than four polyhedron faces are prohibited.
2. Sign Height Measurement. Sign height is measured as the vertical distance from the
average elevation between the highest point and the lowest point of finished grade at
the base of a sign to the top of the sign.

Notes:
1 The river buffer shall be maintained within required civic space, but may be disturbed in order to provide public access to,
and along the waters edge or marsh. The majority of the disturbed area shall remain vegetated, and to the maximum
extent practicable, shall utilize BMPs to adequately infiltrate and divert stormwater runoff. See below Sub-sections
5.10.30.B (Drainage) and 5.10.30.H (Trails and Pathways).
2 Parallel thoroughfares that provide pedestrian and bicycle access may be permitted at waters edge, and may utilize rip
rap, a bulkhead, or seawall for stability. Thoroughfares shall be designed and constructed using BMPs to adequately
infiltrate and divert stormwater runoff, prevent erosion, and protect surrounding vegetation.
3 All residential and non-residential buildings (excluding Single and Two-Family) and all waterfront off-street parking areas
shall contain a pedestrian pathway or sidewalk running parallel to, and immediately adjacent to the waters edge.
B. Drainage. Except for existing agriculture:
1. Apply Stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs). Development adjacent to and
affecting the river buffer or OCRM Critical Line shall apply BMPs in accordance with the
County Manual for Stormwater BMPs, as amended, in the design of drainage and
detention basins. Additional special engineering may be required where the Town
Engineer determines it is necessary to protect nearby waters or wetlands.
2. Divert Drainage Away from OCRM Critical Line. All drainage shall be diverted away
from the OCRM Critical Line, through a Town-approved stormwater system employing
BMPs.
3. Lots Adjoining River Buffer. Lots adjoining the river buffer shall be designed and
engineered to prevent direct discharge from impervious surfaces across the river buffer.
All discharges shall be diverted into the development's stormwater system and treated in
accordance with the requirements of this Development Code. (While agriculture is
exempt from this Subsection, such activities are strongly urged to utilize BMPs.)
C. River Buffer Disturbance.
1. There shall be no disturbance of the river buffer, except as allowed for bulkheads, rip-rap
and erosion control devices, view corridors, public access within civic spaces, and other
allowable disturbances authorized in this Section.
2. Re-vegetation Plan. Any other disturbance of the shoreline within the river buffer
landwards of the OCRM Critical Line shall require submission of a re-vegetation
plan that complies with the standards of Division 5.7 (Landscaping and Screening),
and the following:
a. Intent. A principle objective of the plan is to preserve and replace as much of the
on-site pre-construction native vegetation to the extent possible. Other acceptable
Resource Protection 5.10.30
The Port Royal Code 5-137
landscaping plants are found in the SCDHEC publication entitled Backyard
Buffers, publication CR-003206 (11/00). The re-vegetation plan shall be
prepared by a landscape designer or landscape architect. The re-vegetation plan
shall be designed so that upon plant maturity, the disturbed area is completely
vegetated.
b. Plant Back Requirement. Removal of trees and shrubs shall require plant back on
an inch for inch (trees) or plant for plant (shrubs) basis.
c. Slope Stabilization. Re-vegetation of areas landward of the OCRM Critical Line with
slope topography in excess of a 1:3 slope shall also include slope stabilization
measures in compliance with the South Carolina Sediment and Erosion Control Act.
D. Bulkheads, Rip-Rap, and Erosion Control Devices. All bulkheads, rip-rap, or other erosion
control devices are limited uses that shall comply with the following:
1. Approved by OCRM. A permit to construct the bulkhead, rip-rap or erosion control
device shall be approved by OCRM.
2. Bulkhead, Rip-Rap, or Other Erosion Control Device More Than 48 Inches High. A
proposal to install a bulkhead, rip-rap, or other erosion control device more than 48
inches in total vertical height from the existing ground elevation shall be accompanied by
design plans and certification from a South Carolina registered professional engineer
stating the design is adequate to prevent collapse or other failure.
3. Tree Protection. The bulkhead, rip-rap, or erosion control device shall be in compliance
with Section 5.7.30 (General Landscape Design).
4. Re-vegetation. Any disturbance of shoreline within the river buffer landwards of the
OCRM Critical Line shall require submission of a re-vegetation plan in compliance with
Subsection 5.10.30.C.2 (Re-vegetation Plan) above.
E. View corridor. A view corridor across the river buffer may be established by a landowner in
accordance with the following:
1. Width. The width of the view corridor crossing the river buffer shall be no more than 75
feet or one-third of the lot width, whichever is less.
2. Management. Management of vegetation within the view corridor shall be limited to
only pruning needed to provide views, except that a landowner may submit a selective
clearing and selective landscaping program for the view corridor, which shall be
approved if the net result provides both ample screening of the shoreline and filtering of
runoff from lawns on the lots.
F. Roads. Road crossings are allowed in the river buffer only where no reasonable alternative
exists. Roads shall be elevated and not constructed of or on fill material.
G. Sewer / Water. Crossings for sewer/potable water facilities are allowed in the river buffer
only where no reasonable alternative exists.
H. Trails and Pathways. Trails shall be permitted to cross the river buffer at reasonable intervals
for access to the water. Horizontal trails, such as walking paths and bikeways, will be
allowed with the following requirements:
1. Such trails shall be designed and constructed in a manner that does not result in them
becoming channels for stormwater, that does not result in erosion, or that does not
damage surrounding vegetation.
5.10.40 Resource Protection
5-138 The Port Royal Code
2. The Town may require trails to be of boardwalk construction, pervious paving systems,
or stepping stones if needed to ensure meeting the objectives of the buffer, and for long
term maintenance of the trail.
I. Waiver. Where existing lots (conforming or nonconforming) are so small that a single-family
house cannot be developed on the lot and comply with the required OCRM Critical Line
setbacks and other related standards, the Administrator shall grant a waiver from these
requirements, in accordance with the following provisions:
1. OCRM Critical Line Setback Significantly Limits House Size. The applicant shall
demonstrate:
a. That the size of the home would have to be less than the average size of homes within
five lots on either side of the lot for which the waiver is requested, due to the OCRM
Critical Line setback and application of the other standards in this section; or
b. If there are no homes within five lots of either side of the lot for which the waiver is
requested, a floor area ratio of three-tenths or a maximum building footprint (livable
area) of 15 percent of the total lot area, whichever is less, shall guide the need for a
waiver.
2. Reduction of Street or Front Yard Setback to Avoid Waiver. It is infeasible to reduce the
street or front setback by up to 30 percent in order to avoid the need for a waiver. (In
development that is largely un-built, with lots still in common ownership, the Town may
require the developer to revise covenants to grant reduced street setbacks. The street
setback reduction shall be the minimum possible).
3. Structure Shall Not Encroach Into OCRM Critical Line Setback. To the maximum extent
practicable, the home approved through the waiver is designed so it does not encroach
into the OCRM Critical Line setback area (i.e., design alternatives such as adding a second
or third story, adjusting house dimensions, reducing overall house size, etc., would still
render the noncritical line setback area as unbuildable).
4. Limit on Reduction of OCRM Critical Line Setback. The OCRM Critical Line setback
shall not be reduced to less than a 25-foot setback, except in areas where homes that
already exist are located closer than 25 feet to the OCRM Critical Setback. In those cases,
the average Critical Line setback of adjoining lots shall be used, provided that in no case
shall a setback of less than 20 feet be granted unless the setback is to preserve a specimen
tree, historic resource, or to prevent a lot from becoming unbuildable with comparable
houses as described in Subsection I.1 above. Where the setback is to preserve a specimen
tree or historic resource, the building envelope allowed shall optimize the protection of
the resources.
5. Stormwater Management. If the house and lot do not drain into a stormwater
management system that uses BMPs in accordance with the requirements of this Section,
the landowner shall provide the necessary stormwater management on the lot.
5.10.40 Tidal Wetlands
Development in Tidal Wetlands is prohibited, except for Marine-Oriented Facilities (see Table
4.1.30 Principal Use Table) and accessory Water-Oriented Facilities (see Sub-section 4.3.30.A.1
(Water-Oriented Facilities) with the following:
A. Approved by USACE and OCRM. The plan for development of the Marine-Oriented
Facilities and / or accessory Water-Oriented Facilities shall be approved by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the S.C. Office of Ocean & Coastal Resource
Management (OCRM); and
Resource Protection 5.10.50
The Port Royal Code 5-139
B. Appropriate Design. It is demonstrated the design of the plan for development of the Marine-
Oriented Facilities and / or accessory Water-Oriented Facilities:
1. Minimizes Impact. Minimizes the impact on Tidal Wetlands; and
2. Maximizes Sharing of Facility. Maximizes the sharing of the facility to avoid having
every property in the area seek a similar request. (This may mean shared facilities for the
entire development or facilities that can serve several adjoining properties.)
5.10.50 Non-Tidal Wetlands
Development in Non-tidal Wetlands is prohibited, except in the following instances:
A. Where structures are necessary to a permitted use and cannot be located outside the wetland,
the structure shall be located on piles. Where needed, access shall be provided on structures
such as boardwalks.
B. Private Roads. Road crossings are allowed in non-tidal wetlands only where no reasonable
alternative exists. Roads shall be elevated and not constructed of or on fill material. Where
appropriate, wildlife corridors shall be provided under the roads.
C. Trails. Trails are allowed in non-tidal wetlands where it is demonstrated they are essential to
establish a crossing between different areas, or where the trail has an historical purpose. Trails
shall be of boardwalk construction. The height of the boardwalk shall be above normal high
water to ensure the boardwalk minimally disrupts plant life.
D. Buffers.
1. Vegetative buffers shall be retained or created along the banks or edges of all freshwater
wetlands as part of the required setback distance. The following average depth shall be
established for construction from the boundary of all wetlands.
a. Single and Two-family Residential uses: 20 feet.
b. Multifamily Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Mixed Uses: 50 feet.
c. Impervious parking areas: 30 feet.
2. Vegetative buffers are areas completely pervious to the ground in nature and are
intended to prevent polluted runoff from entering fragile wetland systems. For this
purpose, they shall be a minimum of 15 feet in depth and contain living plant material
including but not limited to trees, shrubs, vines, ferns, mosses, flowers, grasses, herbs and
ground cover.

5.11.30 Stormwater Standards 5-142
5.11.40 Planning for Stormwater 5-142
5.11.10 Purpose
The purpose of these standards is to control the adverse effects of post development stormwater
runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and
redevelopment. This Division seeks to meet this purpose by fulfilling the following objectives:
A. Calibrate these controls based on the context of the site to ensure that walkable, urban
patterns of development are favored as the primary Best Management Practices (BMPs); and
B. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from new development or redevelopment to the
maximum extent practical for the applicable design storm in order to reduce flooding,
siltation, erosion, increases in temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels,
marshes and aquatic habitats; and
C. Minimize increases in non-point and point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff
from development that would otherwise degrade local water quality; and
D. Minimize the total volume of surface water runoff that flows from any specific site during and
following development in order to replicate pre development hydrology to the maximum
extent practicable through the use of structural and nonstructural stormwater management
Best Management Practices (BMPs); and
E. Establish minimum post development stormwater management standards and design criteria
for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality.
5.11.20 Applicability
The standards established in this Division shall apply to all proposed development within the
Town, as conveyed in this Section.
A. Exemptions.
1. Any maintenance, alteration, renewal use or improvement to an existing drainage
structure as approved by the Administrator which does not create adverse environmental
or water quality impacts and does not increase the temperature, rate, quality, or volume
or location of stormwater runoff discharge;
2. Development where adequate drainage exists of fewer than four residential dwelling
units that are not part of a phase of a larger development, not involving a main drainage
canal;
3. Site work on existing one-acre sites or less where impervious area is increased by less
than two percent;
5.11.40 Stormwater
5-142 The Port Royal Code
4. Site work on existing one-acre sites or less where impervious area is increased by less
than two percent, and any earthwork that does not increase runoff and/ or eliminate
detention / retention facilities and / or stormwater storage or alter stormwater flow rates
or discharge location(s);
5. Agricultural activity not involving relocation of drainage canals; or
6. If possible, when work is done by agencies or property owners to mitigate emergency
flooding conditions, the work should be approved by the duly appointed officials in charge
of emergency preparedness or relief. Property owners performing emergency work will be
responsible for any damage or injury to persons or property caused by their unauthorized
actions.
B. Private Drainage Systems Not Town Responsibility. Where private drainage systems and
easements have been previously approved as private facilities, as well as all new development
and redevelopment, such facilities shall not become Town responsibility.
C. Applicability. See the STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND UTILITY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN BEAUFORT COUNTY, SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE TOWN OF PORT
ROYAL, SOUTH CAROLINA dated June 26, 2012 with Attachment.
5.11.30 Stormwater Standards
A. Beaufort County BMP Manual. Where required, all development and redevelopment shall
provide adequate drainage, peak rate, volume and stormwater pollution control in
accordance with Section 3 of the Beaufort County Manual for Stormwater Best Management
and Design Practices (BMP), and the STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND UTILITY
AGREEMENT BETWEEN BEAUFORT COUNTY, SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE TOWN OF
PORT ROYAL, SOUTH CAROLINA dated June 26, 2012 with Attachment, which are
incorporated herein by reference.
B. Reserved.
5.11.40 Planning for Stormwater
A. Planning for Stormwater Should Commence at Project Inception: Planning for
stormwater should commence at project inception. As the requirements set forth above
and elsewhere in BMP manual will require stormwater management to become a vital
aspect of all development and redevelopment projects within the Town, planning for
stormwater management, in accordance with this section shall commence at the time of
initial project inception and presentation to the Administrator. Review of stormwater
management for development and redevelopment will be undertaken during all phases
of the development review process.
B. Stormwater BMPs shall be selected in keeping with the applicable Transect Zone, as
indicated in:
1. Table 5.11.40.A (Stormwater BMPs by Transect Zone).
2. The Light Imprint Handbook  Integrating Sustainability and Community
Design, 2008, Tom Low, DPZ Charlotte. 2008.
Stormwater BMPs shall be selected to respond to the sites location within a volume
sensitive watershed, according to the worksheets provided in the Beaufort County BMP
Manual.

The Port Royal Code 5-143
Table 5.11.40.A: Stormwater BMPs by Transect Zone
Stormwater BMP Type Allowed In
Vegetated Swales are shallow drainage ways that employ
landscaping to provide water quality treatment via
biofiltration. They are designed to remove silt and sediment
associated pollutants before discharging to storm sewers
and to reduce volume if soils allow for infiltration. The
treatment area can be planted in a variety of grasses, sedges
and rushes, while the side slopes can be planted with shrubs
and groundcover. Check dams are added to aid infiltration.
Green Roofs are a way of managing stormwater in urban
areas with limited space for more land intensive BMPs.
Green roofs are able to store stormwater in the soil
medium during rain events, helping to detain runoff. Some
of the stormwater will be taken up by the roots of the
plants and some will be evaporated from the soil medium,
reducing the amount of runoff from the roof.
Pervious Paving Systems allow water to pass freely
through the interstitial space ingrained throughout the
paving matrix, thereby transforming traditionally
impervious surfaces. Several examples are pervious
concrete and asphalt, interlocking pavers, and reinforced
gravel and grass paving.
Rain Gardens are flat-bottomed landscaped depressions
that can be built to any size or shape. Also known as
'bioretention cells', they are designed to allow water to
settle and infiltrate into the soil. They reduce the peak
discharge rate from a site via detention. Water quality
improvements are achieved through particle settling,
nutrient uptake, and filtration as water soaks into the
ground.
Disconnected Downspouts. In lower density
residential areas downspouts should be disconnected
from storm drain systems and directed towards
landscaped areas. This reduces the burden on the storm
drain network and allows runoff to slow and infiltrate
before overflowing to storm drains.
Tree Box Filters are containers filled with a soil
mixture, a mulch layer, under-drain system and a shrub or
tree similar to flow through planters. The compact size of
tree box filters allow volume and water quality control to
be tailored to specific site characteristics and are well
suited to urban areas. Tree box filters provide the added
value of aesthetics while making efficient use of available
land for stormwater management.

Table 5.11.40.A: Stormwater BMPs By Transect Zone (continued)
Stormwater BMP Type Allowed In
Vegetated Flood Plains can be integrated with parks,
playing fields, or unmanaged landscapes. Frequent storm
events can be detained by smaller decentralized means,
while larger storm events should be directed to nonpriority
vegetated landscapes for temporary detention.
Urban Flood Plain. Urban hardscapes can be used for
temporary storage of large storm events. Smaller events
should be mitigated by decentralized means, while the
larger events can be directed toward non-priority spaces
which are planned and designed for the temporary storage
of stormwater flows.
Riffle Pools. Connected landscapes provide retention of
runoff by integrating intermittent vertical drops and
damming in a watercourse. The retained runoff is then
allowed to infiltrate into the groundwater table or
conveyed for further treatment.
Flow-through Planters are landscape features that also
provide stormwater runoff control and treatment. Flowthrough
planters are sealed on all sides and fitted with an
underdrain. They only absorb as much water as soil and
plants in the planter can accommodate. Once the planter
is at capacity, water is then discharged through the
underdrain. They are ideal for receiving roof runoff from
downspouts and can be incorporated into foundation walls.
Infiltration Trenches are subsurface facilities designed
to provide on-site stormwater retention in areas of good
infiltration by collecting and recharging stormwater runoff
into the ground. Trenches filter pollutants to improve
water quality and contribute towards groundwater
recharge. They are relatively low maintenance and can be
easily retrofitted into existing sidewalk areas and medians.
A Natural Channel is a meandering, vegetated
watercourse with natural banks. It is buffered from
development zones by large uncultivated landscape.

Stormwater BMP Type Allowed In
Dry Detention Ponds are basis whose outlets have been
designed to retain stormwater runoff for some minimum
time (e.g. 24 hours) to allow particles and associated
pollutants to settle. Unlike wet ponds, these facilities do not
have a large permanent pool of water. However, they are
often designed with small pools at the inlet and outlet of the
basin. Ponds require land to be set aside in a manner that
can disrupt the quality of the surrounding urbanism. They
should be utilized with caution in the T4 zoning districts.
Wet Retention Ponds consist of a permanent pool of
water into which stormwater runoff from each rain event is
detained and treated in the pond until it is displaced by
runoff from the next storm. Wet ponds allow for additional
biological interactions that assist in improving water quality
for nutrients. Ponds require land to be set aside in a manner
that can disrupt the quality of the surrounding urbanism, and
should be utilized with caution in the T4 zoning districts.
Urban Channels are narrow vegetated or stone lined
conveyances framed by vertical stone or concrete banks
abutting cultivated landscapes or hardscapes.
Level Spreaders are structures that are designed to
uniformly distribute concentrated flow over a large area to
mimic natural sheet flow. Concentrated flow enters the
spreader through a pipe, ditch or swale; the flow is
retarded, energy is dissipated; the flow is distributed
throughout a long linear shallow trench or behind a low
berm; water then flows over the berm/ditch uniformly (in
theory) along the entire length.
Rain Barrels are connected directly to downspouts to
capture and store runoff for future use. Stormwater
discharge is slowed down and water can be reused for
irrigation. Fifty gallons of storage is suggested as a
minimum. Barrels must also have a cover to prevent
insect and debris collection.
Cisterns function similar to rain barrels by collected
stormwater and storing it for reuse, but on a much larger
scale. Cisterns can be stored above ground, buried below
ground, or located inside of buildings. They typically store
rainwater for reuse in irrigation, mechanical uses, toilet
flushing, and fire prevention.

explosions, wind, earthquake, war, riot or other act, shall not be restored or reconstructed
and used except in conformity with the requirements of this Development Code and all
rights as a nonconforming use are terminated. The provisions of this subsection shall not
apply to any single family dwelling residence used for residential purposes.
B. For purposes of this section, the percentage of damage for buildings shall be calculated by
dividing the estimated cost of restoring the building as nearly as possible to its condition
prior to the occurrence, by the appraised value of the building (excluding the value of the
land) immediately prior to the occurrence.
C. The percentage of damage for other structures shall be calculated by dividing the
estimated cost of restoring the structure (or sign) by its reasonable replacement cost.
6.2.40 Reconstruction
A nonconforming structure shall not be demolished and rebuilt as a nonconforming structure,
except a nonconforming structure listed in the Beaufort County Above Ground Historic
6.2.50 Nonconforming Structures
6-4 The Port Royal Code
Resources Survey Beaufort County, South Carolina ( amended 1 9 9 7 ) may be allowed to
be rebuilt within the original (pre-demolition) footprint.
6.2.50 Extensions
A nonconforming building shall not be enlarged, intensified, or extended in such a way
except in conformity with this Development Code except as follows:
A. In cases where the primary building on a lot is nonconforming solely as a result of a
setback encroachment, additions to the structure can be allowed, provided the new
addition does not project into the setback. If a proposed addition would encroach into the
same setback that already had been encroached upon, the addition can be allowed,
provided that it projects no further into the setback than the existing structure, and in no
way extends past the line of the existing structure. This section does not apply to a
nonresidential use which adjoins a residential use on the side of the lot having the setback
nonconformity (See Figure 6.2.50.A, Permitted Extensions for Nonconforming Buildings).

Division 6.3: Nonconforming Lots of Record
Section: Page #
6.3.10 Nonconforming Lots of Record 6-5
6.3.10 Nonconforming Lots of Record
A. This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots of record. A lot is
undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it.
B. When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations
applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller in area and/or width than the
required minimum set forth in Article 3 (Specific to Zones), then the lot may be used just
as if it were conforming.
C. When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other
respects, but the applicable setback requirements set forth in Article 3 (Specific to Zones)
cannot reasonably be complied with, then the entity authorized to issue a permit for the
proposed use may allow deviations from the setback requirements if it finds that:
1. The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such
deviations; and
2. These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and
3. The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact
on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
D. For purposes of paragraph C above, compliance with applicable building setback
requirements is not reasonably possible if a building serving the minimal needs of the
proposed use cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with
such setback requirements; however, mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds
for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
E. Any lot or parcel of land resulting from any division shall comply with the zone
minimum lot area and width standards.
F. Unity of title shall be required for any construction or expansion where multiple
nonconforming lots are used as a single parcel for development purposes. In
consideration of the Towns issuance of a permit for such construction, the landowner
shall agree to restrict such lots in the following manner:
1. The property shall be considered as one parcel of land, and no portion of that parcel
of land shall be sold, transferred, devised or assigned separately, except in its entirety
as one parcel of land. Any further subdivision of the parcel of land shall comply with
this Development Code. This condition, restriction and limitation shall be deemed a
covenant running with the land, and shall remain in full force and effect and be
binding upon any landowner, and heirs and assigns.
2. A unity of agreement shall be recorded in the public records of Beaufort County
acknowledging the above requirements and placing the required covenant upon the
6.3.10 Nonconforming Lots of Record
6-6 The Port Royal Code
land. Release of any recorded unity of title agreement must be approved by Beaufort
County.

violation of this article shall be declared to be illegally nonconforming and shall be
removed after 30 days' notice. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign during the
permitted time, then the Town Manager or his/her designate, or an independent
contractor secured by the Town shall remove the sign and the ensuing charges shall be
assessed to the owner or lessee.
B. A nonconforming sign shall not be changed or replaced with another nonconforming
sign, including changing the sign face, except for changeable copy signs.
C. An existing nonconforming sign cannot be modified in any way aside from routine
maintenance without bringing the sign into conformity with this section subject to the
provisions outlined in subsection D.
D. Any existing sign not meeting the requirements of this Development Code shall be
brought into compliance with this Development Code before a business license will be
issued for a new resident business. Any existing sign not meeting the requirements of this
Development Code shall be brought into compliance with this section before a business
name can be changed.
E. Temporary nonconforming signs having obtained a sign permit before the adoption date
of this Development Code, shall be permitted to remain for the life of the permit.
F. Signs on awnings or canopies shall be removed when the tenant vacates the building.
G. Nonconforming supports and brackets and unused signs must be completely removed
before a new sign is installed. Any holes in the building must be appropriately patched.

8.6.20 Variance Permit
A. Purpose.
A Variance Permit may be approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals if the Board
concludes that the strict enforcement of the development standards set forth in this
Development Code would result in an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and that by
granting the variance, the spirit of this Development Code will be observed, public
welfare and safety will not be diminished, and substantial justice will be done.
B. Application.
A variance application form as published by the Administrator and appropriate fee as
required by Section 8 .1.30 (Application Forms and Fees) shall be required, along with
such accompanying material as is required to ensure compliance with the criteria listed
below. No variances to the sign regulations of this Development Code shall be permitted.
C. Approval Process.
Staff Review and Report.
1. The Administrator shall prepare a staff report which shall be provided to the
applicant or appellant and the Zoning Board of Appeals before the scheduled
hearing.
2. Action by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
a. Following published and posted notice in accordance with Division 8 .1
(Approval Procedures), the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing.
b. After review of the Variance Permit application and the public hearing, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall make a written finding and give its approval;
approval with modifications or conditions; or disapproval.

shall be communicated in writing to the applicant within 15 working days and
the applicant shall be authorized to submit a development permit application.
3. Mailed Notice.
A courtesy notice of any Variance Permit application shall be provided by US Mail to
all property owners within 200 feet of the subject property. Failure to provide such
notice shall not be considered a jurisdictional defect, provided that published notice

D. Criteria for Approval of Variance Permits.
1. Required Findings.
A Variance Permit may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals if the Board

done. A Variance Permit may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary
hardship only when the Board makes and explains in writing all of the following
findings:
a. Extraordinary Conditions. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions
pertaining to the particular piece of property. For example, the variance is
justified because of topographic or other special conditions unique to the property

and development involved, in contradistinction to the mere inconvenience or
financial disadvantage;
b. Other Property. These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the
vicinity;
c. Conditions. The conditions are not the result of the applicant's own actions;
d. Comprehensive Plan. Granting of the variance would not substantially conflict
with the Comprehensive Plan and the purposes of this Development Code;
e. Utilization. Because of these conditions, the application of the Development Code
to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably
restrict the utilization of the property; and
f. Substantial detriment. The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property or the public good, and the character of the zone
will not be harmed by the granting of the Variance Permit.
2. Limitations.
The Board may not grant a Variance Permit the effect of which would be any of the
following:
a. The Board may not grant a variance the effect of which would be to allow the
establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in the applicable zone;
b. To increase the density of a use above that permitted by the applicable zone;
c. To extend physically a nonconforming use of land; or
d. To change the zone boundaries shown on the Official Zoning Map.
3. Profitability Not to Be Considered.
The fact that property may be utilized more profitably should a Variance Permit be
granted may not be considered grounds for a variance.
4. Hardship Due to Eminent Domain.
Where the alleged hardship results from the taking of part of the property by eminent
domain, thus reducing the land area available for parking, buffers, and other
purposes, the applicant shall have the burden of proving that, after good-faith efforts
by the applicant or previous owner, the condemning authority failed or refused to
provide the applicant compensation adequate to cover the value of both the land
actually taken and the economic impacts of the reduction in the size of the remaining
property. Only if the applicant meets this burden of proof will a hardship under these
conditions be considered adequate to justify the granting of a Variance Permit.
5. Conditions.
In granting a Variance Permit, the Board may attach to it conditions regarding the
location, character, or other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as the
Board may consider advisable to protect established property values in the
surrounding area, or to promote the public health, safety, or general welfare.
E. Appeal.
Any party aggrieved by the Zoning Board of Appeals decision may appeal such
determination to the Circuit Court of Beaufort County within 30 days of the decision.

two and a half stories with a storefront treatment that most often accommodates commercial
or other uses that are too large or intense to be appropriately housed in a residential building
type. The front façade is typically flat, often with a shopfront or gallery frontage. These
buildings remain true to their function and take inspiration from the large vernacular
structures of the lowcountry, including: packing sheds, barns, warehouses, and waterborne
industries. They are often located at prominent intersections or activity areas outside the
traditional Town core. See Section 5.1.130 (Flex Building).
Flex Space: A room or group of internally connected rooms designed to accommodate an
evolution of use over time in response to an evolving market demand. Typically designed to

with the most pedestrian activity, as determined by the Administrator, will always be the
Front. All other frontages may be considered to be side street frontages.
For lots with frontages along a thoroughfare and a civic space, the Front may be the
frontage along either the thoroughfare or the civic space, or both frontages may be treated
as Fronts.
For lots with a single frontage along a thoroughfare or a civic space, but not both, that
frontage is the front.
Frontages along alleys and pedestrian passages are not common, but are permitted (see
Section 2.2.80 Lots). Frontages along service drives and parking drives may never be a
front.
