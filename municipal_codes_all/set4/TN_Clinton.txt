Preface
This code is the result of a comprehensive codification and revision of the
ordinances of the Town of Clinton, Tennessee. By referring to the historical
citation appearing at the end of each section, the user will be able to ascertain
the ordinance or the former code section from which the particular section has
been derived. The absence of a historical citation means that the section was
added at the time this code was prepared. The word "modified" in the historical
citation indicates substantial modification of the provision as originally enacted.
The attention of the user is directed to the arrangement of the code into
titles, chapters, and sections, which is similar to that used in the Tennessee
Code Annotated. Related matter is kept together, so far as possible, within the
same title. Each section number is complete within itself, containing the title
number, the chapter number, and the section of the chapter of which it is a part.
Specifically, the first number is the title number followed by a hyphen, then the
chapter number, with the last two numbers showing the section number within
the chapter, so that, for example, title 10, chapter 2, section 6, is designated as
section 10-206.
By utilizing the table of contents at the beginning of each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should readily find all provisions in the code relating to
any questions that might arise.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) All ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code must be adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 8 of the adopting ordinance
for the code).
(2) One copy of each ordinance adopted by the town must be furnished
to MTAS immediately after its adoption (see section 8 of the adopting
ordinance).
(3) The town will reimburse MTAS for the actual costs of reproducing
replacement pages for the code (no charge is made for the consultant's work, and
reproduction costs are usually nominal).
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinance. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date. If this very simple procedure is followed the code will
be kept up to date in a way that will serve fully the needs of the town's officials
and citizens. If any questions or problems arise concerning the up-dating
iii
procedure, an MTAS Ordinance Codification Consultant is available to the town
for advice and assistance.
The able assistance of Mrs. Claudia Wolfenbarger, the MTAS
Administrative Secretary who did all the typing on this project, is gratefully
acknowledged.

discretion shall disclose, before the exercise of the discretion when possible, the
interest on a form provided by and filed with the recorder. In addition, the
official or employee may, to the extent allowed by law, charter, ordinance, or

applicable law.
(2) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city
attorney shall investigate any credible complaint against an appointed

authorize an investigation by the city attorney or another individual or
entity chosen by the city council.

would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
(4) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule, or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel or
civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code of ethics. (as added
by Ord. #517, Jan. 2006)

TRAVEL EXPENSE POLICY
SECTION
4-301. Policy purpose and intent.
4-302. General policy.
4-303. Travel requests.
4-304. Advances.
4-305. Transportation.
4-306. Lodging.
4-307. Meals and incidentals.
4-308. Entertainment.
4-309. Travel reconciliation.
4-301. Policy purpose and intent. This policy shall constitute the
official policy regarding travel incurred by City of Clinton officials, board or
committee members, or employees while in travel status and on official City of
Clinton business. Authorization for travel and reimbursement of expenses must
be in accordance with the provisions in this policy. It is the intent of this policy
to assure fair and equitable treatment to all individuals traveling on city
business at city expense. (as added by Ord. #590, Oct. 2011)
4-302. General policy. (1) In the interpretation and application of this
policy, the term "traveler" or "authorized traveler" means any elected or
appointed city officer or employee, including members of city boards and
committees appointed by the mayor or the council, and the employees of such
boards and committees who are traveling on official city business and whose
travel was authorized in accordance with this policy. "Authorized traveler" shall
not include the spouse, children, other relatives, friends, or companions
accompanying the authorized traveler on city business, unless the person(s)
otherwise qualifies as an authorized traveler under this policy.
(2) Authorized travelers are entitled to reimbursement of certain
expenditures incurred while traveling on official business for the city.
Reimbursable expenses shall include expenses for transportation; lodging;
meals; registration fees for conferences, conventions and seminars; and other
actual and necessary expenses related to official business as determined by the
city manager. Expenses considered excessive will not be allowed. Under certain
conditions, entertainment expenses may be eligible for reimbursement.
(3) Travel must be necessary to execute official city business or
educational objectives. Professional meetings, conferences, or workshops must
be directly connected to the individual’s duties and role within the city. If
attending a conference, supporting documentation showing the dates of the
Change 9, April 28, 2014 4-8
conference must be attached to the travel expense report form. Any dates
outside the conference dates must be explained.
(4) When traveling, all individuals should be as conservative as
circumstances permit. Reimbursement for travel will be based upon the most
direct or expeditious route possible. Employees traveling by an indirect route
must assume any extra expense incurred.
(5) A complete reason must be provided to describe the purpose of the
travel. Single words such as "meeting," "research," or "conference" do not
constitute an adequate reason.
(6) The city manager or his or her designee shall be responsible for the
enforcement of these travel regulations. The city manager shall have the
authority to grant exception to any part or all of these rules and regulations
when deemed appropriate and necessary.
(7) Deliberate disregard of these regulations or filing of an
intentionally misleading or fraudulent travel claim is grounds for disciplinary
and/or legal action for recovery of fraudulent travel claims and/or advances. (as
added by Ord. #590, Oct. 2011)
4-303. Travel requests. (1) To ensure reimbursements for official
travel, an approved authorization for travel form is required.1 All travel forms
shall be approved by the department head and city manager (city manager
forms approved by city mayor). Lack of pre-approval does not prohibit
reimbursement, but it does assure reimbursement within the limits of this
policy.
(2) All cost associated with the travel should be reasonably estimated
and shown on the authorization for travel form.
(3) An approved authorization for travel form is required before
advanced expenses are paid or travel advances are authorized.
(4) If applicable, a copy of the conference or seminar program should
be attached to the form. If the program is not available prior to the travel, it
should be submitted with the travel expense report. (as added by Ord. #590,
Oct. 2011)
4-304. Advances. An individual traveling on city business may receive
an advance of money to cover expenses to be incurred while traveling.
(1) Travel advance requests are not considered documentation of travel
expenses. If travel advances exceed documented expenses, the traveler must
reimburse the city within ten (10) days.
(2) It will be the responsibility of the finance director to initiate action
to recover any undocumented travel advances. If a cash advance is not repaid
1The City of Clinton Authorization for Travel form is of record in the office
of the recorder.
Change 9, April 28, 2014 4-9
within thirty (30) days, a deduction may be made from the employee's payroll
check. Any person for whom a payroll deduction is made will forfeit future cash
advance privileges.
(3) All travel advances must be requested on the authorization for
travel form and must be submitted no later than five (5) business days before
travel departure date. No travel advances will be issued more than thirty (30)
days prior to the travel departure date. (as added by Ord. #590, Oct. 2011)
4-305. Transportation. (1) All potential costs should be considered
when selecting the mode of transportation. Time away from work should also be
considered.
(2) City vehicles may be used for transportation while on official city
business unless considerations of time or distance would indicate that such use
would be unreasonable. If a city vehicle is used, the traveler is responsible for
seeing that the vehicle is used properly and only for acceptable city business.
The employee will be reimbursed for expenses directly related to the actual and
normal use of the city vehicle when proper documentation is provided.
(3) Use of personal vehicles for travel on city business shall be allowed;
however, city owned vehicles shall be used when feasible. Reimbursement shall
be at the current rate as established by the Internal Revenue Service Standard
Mileage Rate. The miles for reimbursement shall be paid from origin to
destination and back by the most direct route. Necessary vicinity travel related
to official city business will be reimbursed subject to documented necessity as
business-related. If an indirect route is taken, the Rand-McNally mileage table
will be used to determine the mileage to be reimbursed.
(4) If a personal vehicle is used by two (2) or more travelers on the
same trip, only the traveler who owns or has custody of the vehicle will be
reimbursed for mileage. It is the responsibility of the traveler to provide
adequate insurance to hold harmless the city for any liability from the use of the
personal vehicle. Travelers will not be reimbursed for automobile repair or
breakdowns when using their personal vehicle.
(5) Storage or parking charges resulting from the authorized use of
either city or personal vehicles shall be at the expense of the city. Fines for
traffic or parking violations will not be reimbursed by the city. Reasonable tolls
will be allowed when the most direct route requires them.
(6) In no event will mileage reimbursement plus vicinity travel and
associated vehicle costs exceed the lowest reasonable air fare and associated air
fare travel costs.
(7) When other modes of travel are to be used, the city shall provide
or pay for tickets for rail, air or bus transportation and any associated costs such
as travel insurance,etc. The city will pay for the lowest available fare for these
modes of transportation. When possible, the traveler should make full use of
discounts for advance reservations.
Change 9, April 28, 2014 4-10
(8) When an individual travels by common carrier, reasonable fares
will be allowed for necessary ground transportation. Bus or limousine service to
and from airports should be used when available and practical. The city will
reimburse mileage for travel to and from the local airport and parking fees. The
most economical means of transport should be used.
(9) For travel between lodging quarters and meetings, conferences, or
meals, reasonable taxi fares will be allowed. Transportation to and from
personal trips (e.g. entertainment, shopping) will not be reimbursed.
(10) Use of a rental car is not permitted unless it is less expensive or
otherwise more practical than public transportation. Approval of car rental is
required in advance by the city manager. Anyone who uses a rental car for
out-of-state travel must obtain liability coverage from the vendor.
(11) If necessary to accommodate meeting times and travel
arrangements, expenses will be covered for one (1) day before and after meeting
dates.
(12) The traveler will be required to take annual leave for any
additional time taken beyond the day before and after the meeting dates unless
the traveler extends the trip to take advantage of discount fares. Additional
authorized travel days must be pre-approved by the city manager. (as added by
Ord. #590, Oct. 2011)
4-306. Lodging. (1) Reimbursement for lodging will be based upon the
locality, purpose of travel, and availability of accommodations. Reasonableness
and economy should be exercised by the traveler in all instances. Hotels that
offer government rates should be used when available.
(2) Actual cost of single occupancy of hotel or motel room shall be at
the expense of the city. When a room is occupied by more than one (1) person
and the additional occupant(s) is not on official city business, reimbursement
will be made in the amount charged for single occupancy.
(3) The city’s tax exempt status should be used for all in-state lodging.
It is the traveler’s responsibility to provide the necessary documentation and
payment method required by the vendor in order to avoid sales tax charges.
Sales tax charges will not be reimbursed by the city.
(4) A detailed receipt showing itemized room charges and taxes (if
applicable) is required for all authorized travel. (as added by Ord. #590, Oct.
2011)
4-307. Meals and incidentals. (1) The authorized traveler will be
reimbursed a daily amount of forty dollars ($40.00) as per diem. The per diem
amount is expected to cover meals, tips, porters, and incidental expenses. The
traveler will not be reimbursed more than the per diem amount. Receipts are
not required for meals and incidentals.
(2) The following rates will apply for the day of departure and the day
of return:
Change 9, April 28, 2014 4-11
Departure: Prior to 9:00 A.M. 100%
After 9:00 A.M. 50%
Return: Prior to 5:00 P.M. 50%

(3) If a meal is included as part of a conference or seminar fee, the
daily per diem rate shall be reduced as follows:
Breakfast 20%
Lunch 30%
Dinner 50%
(4) For travel that does not require an overnight stay, per diem will be
reimbursed at fifty percent (50%) of the established daily rate only if the
traveler is required by city business to be outside a fifty (50) mile area of city
hall and is in travel status for eight (8) hours or longer. (as added by Ord. #590,
Oct. 2011)
4-308. Entertainment. (1) The city may pay for certain entertainment
expenses provided that:

the entertainment expense claims.

business subject to city manager approval prior to the meeting.

expenses must include:
(a) Original receipts from the vendor (restaurant, caterer, ticket
office, etc.). Only reasonable tips and gratuities included on the receipt
by the vendor are reimbursable.
(b) A disclosure and explanation statement explaining the
purpose of the entertainment and identifying the group and the number
of people entertained (or individual names listed if not a recognized
group). (as added by Ord. #590, Oct. 2011)
4-309. Travel reconciliation. (1) Within ten (10) day of return from
travel, the traveler is expected to complete and file the travel expense report
form.1 It must be certified by the traveler that the amount due is true and
1The City of Clinton Travel Expense Report form is of record in the office

Change 9, April 28, 2014 4-12
accurate. Original receipts must be provided for all expenses in excess of five
dollars ($5.00).
(2) If the city provided a travel advance, the traveler should include
that information on the expense form. The balance due the traveler or the
refund due the city should be clearly indicated on the travel expense report
form. If the city is due a refund, the traveler should attach a check made
payable to the city.
(3) The traveler is responsible for providing the city with original paid
receipts for any payments made by the city directly to travel related vendors
(e.g. hotels, conferences). (as added by Ord. #590, Oct. 2011)

1State law reference
Tennessee Code Annotated, sections 67-1-701, 67-1-702 and 67-1-801,
read together, permit a municipality to collect its own property taxes
if its charter authorizes it to do so, or to turn over the collection of its
property taxes to the county trustee. Apparently, under those same
provisions, if a municipality collects its own property taxes, tax due
and delinquency dates are as prescribed by the charter; if the county
trustee collects them, the tax due date is the first Monday in October,
and the delinquency date is the following March 1.
2State law reference
Tennessee Code Annotated, section 67-1-801(c) provides that if the
county trustee collects the municipality's property taxes, a penalty of
1/2 of 1% and interest of 1% shall be added on the first day of March,
following the tax due date and on the first day of each succeeding
month.

from the due date at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, and as liable
for an additional penalty of one percent (1%) for each month or fraction thereof

imposed is unlawful and shall be punishable by a civil penalty not in excess of
fifty dollars ($50.00). (as added by Ord. #439, Nov. 2002)

follows:
All of that area bounded by a line beginning at the intersection of the
Bush Brothers eastern property line and the Clinch River, thence along said
property line in a northerly direction to the intersection of such line and Eagle
Bend Road; thence in a westerly direction along Eagle Bend Road to a point 200
feet east of the intersection of Eagle Bend Road and North Charles Seivers Blvd;
thence along a line, parallel to and 200 feet northeast and southeast of the
center line of North Charles Seivers Blvd, in a northwesterly and northeasterly
direction to the intersection of such line and Weaver Avenue; thence along
Weaver Avenue in a northwesterly direction to the intersection of Weaver
Avenue and North Charles Seivers Blvd; thence northeast along North Charles
1Municipal code references
Building, utility and housing codes: title 12.
2The significance of the fire district is that Chapter III of the Standard
Building Code, applicable to the City of Clinton through title 4 of this code,
imposes certain construction, modification and other requirements peculiar to
buildings located within the fire district, and prohibits Hazardous (Group H)
occupancies within the fire district. Chapter IV, Section 408 of the Standard
Building Code defines Hazardous (Group H) occupancy in both general and
specific terms, but generally it refers to occupancies involving highly
combustible, flammable or explosive materials.

feet west of the center line of Main Street, to the intersection of said line and
Timothy Avenue; thence east along Timothy Avenue to the intersection of
Timothy Avenue and Main Street and, continuing along Meadowbrook Street,
to a point 200 feet to the east of Main Street; thence north along a line, lying
parallel to and 200 feet east of Main Street, to the intersection of said line and
Clinch Avenue; thence east along Clinch Avenue to the intersection of Clinch
Avenue and the Clinch River; thence north along the west bank of the Clinch
River to the point of beginning. (1969 Code, § 7-101, as replaced by Ord. #482,
Dec. 2005)
7-102. Fire district significance. The significance of the fire district is
that chapter 3 of the International Building Code, applicable to the City of
Clinton through title 12 of this code, imposes certain construction, modification
and other requirements peculiar to buildings located within the fire district, and
prohibits hazardous (group H) occupancies within the fire district. Chapter 3
section 307 of the International Building Code and Appendix E of the
International Fire Code defines high hazardous (group H) occupancies in both
general and specific terms, but generally it refers to occupancies involving
highly combustible, flammable or explosive materials. (as added by Ord. #482,

conciliation procedure is as follows:
(1) Complaints.
(a) A person who claims that another person has committed a
discriminatory housing practice may report that offense to the board and
file an informal complaint. An informal complaint may also be filed by
the board if he has reasonable evidence to believe that a person has
committed a discriminatory housing practice.
(b) The board shall treat a complaint referred by the secretary
of Housing and Urban Development or the Attorney General of the
United States under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, Public Law 90-284, as
an informal complaint filed under subparagraph (a).
(c) An informal complaint must be in writing, verified and
contain the following:
(1) Identity of the actor;
(2) Date of offense and date of filing the informal
complaint;

origin);
(4) Name and signature of complaintant.
(d) Not more than 20 days after the filing of an informal
complaint, the board shall notify the actor named in the complaint that:
(1) An informal complaint alleging the commission of a
discriminatory housing practice has been filed against the actor;
(2) The actor will be furnished a copy of the complaint
upon request; and
(3) The actor may file a written, subscribed, informal
answer to the informal complaint.
(e) An informal complaint or answer may be amended at any
time before the board notifies the city attorney (under paragraph 5) of a
discriminatory housing practice upon which the informal complaint is
based. The board shall furnish a copy of each amended informal
complaint or answer to the actor or complaintant, respectively, as
promptly as practicable.
(f) Except for an offense based on a complaint referred under
subsection (b), a person may not be prosecuted in municipal court for a
discriminatory housing practice unless an informal complaint on the
offense for which he is charged is filed not more than 90 days after the
commission of the offense.
(g) The board may not disclose or permit to be disclosed to the
public the identity of the actor before the board notifies the city attorney
(under paragraph 5) of a discriminatory housing practice alleged against
the actor in an informal complaint or while the informal complaint is in
the process of being investigated and prior to completion of all
negotiations.
(2) Investigation.
(a) With respect to each discriminatory housing practice alleged
in an informal complaint and each discriminatory housing practice
determined from reasonable evidence by the board for which no informal
complaint has been filed, the board shall conduct as promptly as
practicable an investigation to determine whether there is probable cause
to believe an offense was committed and the facts of the offense. This
subsection does not limit the authority of the board to conduct such other
investigations or to use such other enforcement procedures, otherwise
lawful, as he considers necessary to enforce this chapter.
(b) If the board determines that there is not probable cause to
believe that a particular alleged or suspected discriminatory housing
practice has been committed, the board shall take no further action with
respect to that alleged or suspected offense.
(3) Conciliation agreement.
9-18
(a) The board determines that there is probable cause to believe
that a discriminatory housing practice alleged in an informal complaint
has been committed, the board and the actor, or a person who owns,
controls, or manages a housing accommodation involved in the offense,
or a person who employs the actor may voluntarily enter into a
conciliation agreement.
(b) If a conciliation agreement is executed under this paragraph,
a party to the agreement may not be prosecuted in municipal court for an
offense specified in the agreement unless the board determines that the
agreement has been violated and notifies the city attorney in writing of
the violation.
(c) A conciliation agreement must be in writing in the form
approved by the city attorney and must be signed and verified by the
board and each other party to the agreement. A conciliation agreement
that is not executed before the expiration of 30 days after notification to
the actor as required under paragraph 1(d) must include the city attorney
as a party. If a conciliation agreement is not reached within twenty (20)
days after the city attorney is included as a party, the city attorney shall

conciliation agreement is executed upon its signing and verification by all
parties to the agreement.

contain:
(1) An identification of the discriminatory housing

agreement under subparagraph (a) and the identification of any
other discriminatory housing practice and actor that the parties

conciliation agreement with the board agrees:
(a) Not to violate this chapter or the conciliation

which states with respect to each person of the specified
class (the race, color, sex, religion, or national origin alleged
as the basis of discrimination in the informal complaint on
the offense) who in person contacts a party to the
conciliation agreement concerning either sale, rental, or
financing in connection with a housing accommodation or a
business relating to selling or renting housing
accommodations the name and address or telephone number
of the person, the date of each contact, and the result of
9-19
each contact. The party who prepares the activity report
shall sign and verify the report. An activity report must be
filed each month on the date specified in the conciliation
agreement for a period of not fewer than three nor more
than 24 months, as required by the conciliation agreement.
(e) In addition to the requirements of this subsection, a
conciliation agreement may include any other condition agreed to be the
parties.
(f) If the board determines that a conciliation agreement has
been violated, the board shall give written notice to all actors subject to
the agreement.
(4) Violations of conciliation agreement.
(a) A person commits an offense if, after he and the board
execute a conciliation agreement he intentionally, knowingly, or
recklessly violates the conciliation agreement.
(b) It is no defense to prosecution under this section that, with
respect to a discriminatory housing practice that gave rise to the
conciliation agreement;
(1) The actor did not commit the offense; or
(2) The board did not have probable cause to believe the
offense was committed.
(5) Notification of the city attorney.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (b), if the
board determines that there is probable cause to believe that a
discriminatory housing practice alleged in an informal complaint has
been committed, he shall promptly notify the city attorney in writing of
the identification of the actor and offense and request prosecution in
municipal court.
(b) If the board elects to attempt a conciliation, he may postpone
notification for a period of not more than 30 days after notification to the
actor of an informal complaint. However, if a conciliation agreement is
executed during the period of postponement, the board is not required to
notify the city attorney of the identification of the actor or of an offense
specified in the conciliation agreement unless the board determines that
the agreement has been violated.
(c) Notification required under subsection (a) is not a
prerequisite to prosecution for an offense under this chapter. Except for
notice prohibited under subparagraph (b), this paragraph does not limit
communications, otherwise lawful, between the board and city attorney.
(6) Dismissal of charges. If, after the city attorney files a charge in the
municipal court charging an actor with a discriminatory housing practice, a
conciliation agreement is executed before commencement of trial on the offense,
the city attorney shall cease prosecution and move for dismissal of the charge.
(as added by Ord. No. 147)

herein, the city may collect the cost assessed against the property owner or
owners through an action for debt filed in any court of competent jurisdiction.

owners of the properties against whom such cost have been assessed, and the
fact that multiple owners have been joined in one (1) action shall not be
considered by the court as a misjoinder of parties.

and order of the building official may appeal the determination and order to the
city council. The appeal shall be filed with the city recorder within ten (10) days
following the receipt of the notice issued by the building official. The failure to
appeal within this time shall, without exception, constitute a waiver of the right
to a hearing.
(7) Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by an order or act of city
council under subsection (5) above may seek judicial review of the order or act.
The time period established in (4) above shall be stayed during the pendency of

complaint or order shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens
notices provided by law. (as added by Ord. #599, Nov. 2013)
13-411. Enjoining enforcement of orders. Any person affected by an order
issued by the public officer served pursuant to this chapter may file a bill in

Change 9, April 28, 2014 13-13

a temporary injunction restraining the public officer pending the final
disposition of the cause; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the
posting and service of the order of the public officer, such person shall file such
bill in the court.

affected by an order of the public officer shall be entitled to recover any damages
for action taken pursuant to any order of the public officer, or because of
noncompliance by such person with any order of the public officer. (as added by

enforcement of the provisions of its charter or any other ordinances or
regulations, nor to prevent or punish violations thereof, and the powers
conferred by this chapter shall be in addition and supplemental to the powers
conferred by the charter and other laws. (as added by Ord. #599, Nov. 2013)

be unlawful for any owner of record to create, maintain or permit to be
maintained in the city structures which are unfit for human occupation or use
due to dilapidation, defects increasing the hazards of fire, accident or other
calamities, lack of ventilation, light or sanitary facilities, or due to other
conditions rendering such dwellings unsafe or unsanitary, or dangerous or
detrimental to the health, safety and morals, or otherwise inimical to the
welfare of the residents of the city. Violations of this section shall subject the

structures placed in or on any yard partition of a lot that would obstruct the
vision of auto or pedestrian traffic using the intersecting public streets. (Ord.
No. 317, sec. 2)
14-308. Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations. The purpose of
the Planned Unit Development regulations is to provide for diversification in the
relationship of uses and structures to their sites and also provide flexibility
which will create a more desirable living environment. A PUD shall mean an
integrated, professionally prepared design for development of residential,
commercial, or industrial uses, or as permitted, combinations of such uses, to
allow application of new techniques and technology of site and building design
and location; this for the purpose of achieving economies in land usage,
maintenance, and street and utility systems while providing for attractive open
areas, safe circulation, and general well-being of the inhabitants.
(1) Applicability of PUD regulations. A PUD may be developed in any
district provided that the uses permitted and density requirements of the
district allow the development and the PUD plan elements are approved by the
planning commission. Residential, commercial, public, semipublic, or industrial
uses, or combinations of these uses where district or special regulations permit,
may be developed under the PUD concept. Cluster type subdivisions and
condominiums, townhouses, multi-dwelling units, rental developments,
multi-use parks, travel trailer parks, and multi-use or ownership developments
shall be considered as PUD's for the purpose of this ordinance.
14-23
(2) Relationships of PUD regulations to district and site plan
regulations. Unless specifically altered by any provision of this section, the use
and development regulations of sections 14-601 through 14-611, sections 14-310
and 14-311, or any other applicable provision of this ordinance shall apply to the
development of a PUD.
(3) General requirements. All PUD developments shall comply with
the following requirements.
(a) Minimum site. No PUD shall have an area less than that
required by the planning commission as adequate for the proposed
project; however, the minimum site shall not be less than the minimum
lot size required in the district in which the proposed project is to be
located.
(b) Structures and open space. The planning commission shall
require structures and open space to be arranged on the site in such a
way that adjacent uses will not be adversely affected.
(i) Where feasible, the highest height and intensity of
uses shall be toward the interior of the projects.
(ii) No freestanding building shall be located closer than
twenty (20) feet to any other freestanding building.
(iii) Minimum setback, and lot width setback
requirements for lots as established in chapters 6 and 7 may be
altered upon approval of the planning commission; except that, in
no case shall the setback from any exterior project site side or rear
property line be less than twenty-five (25) feet.
(iv) Landscaping/buffering requirements, as contained in
sections 14-310 and 14-311 and chapter 6, shall be applied to PUD
developments; except that, the planning commission may require
additional landscape materials or structures where it is deemed to
be in the public interest to do so.
(4) Open space requirements. Preservation, maintenance, and
ownership of open space areas and facilities shall be accomplished by one or
more of the following methods, and shall be established in an appropriate legal
manner.
(a) Dedication to and acceptance by the public as part of a
governmentally administered park and open space system.
(b) A property owners association.
(c) The developer or management authority of the PUD.
(5) Parking and access control requirements. The provisions of this
ordinance relating to vehicular access and parking (sections 14-302 through 307)
shall be adhered to; except that, the planning commission may alter these
requirements in instances in which a superior design alternative is presented
which will not be detrimental to the public interest or in conflict with the intent
of this ordinance.
14-24
(6) Density requirements for residential PUD. The density (units per
gross acre) of dwelling units in a PUD shall be no greater than that allowed in
the zoning district within which a PUD is located. The open spaces around
public structures, such as schools and churches may be included in the gross
acreage of the site for the purpose of calculating the number of residential units
that are allowed within a PUD.
(7) Signs. The number, size, type, and placement of signs within
PUD's shall be governed by the applicable provisions of Section 14-309 of this
ordinance.
(8) Street and utility construction standards. Public and common
ways for pedestrian and vehicular circulation shall be developed in relationship
to other existing or planned streets and ways and with the Clinton Major Road
Plan. Whether or not the subdivision of property is proposed within a PUD, all
project street and way improvements shall comply with the construction
standards set out in the subdivision regulations. Due to the uniqueness of each
PUD, the owner/developer of a PUD may request slight adjustments from
widths of streets, ways, utility easements, curbing, and similar standards set
out in the subdivision regulations; and, upon a determination of good cause
being shown for such adjustments, the planning commission may permit
changes or alterations in standards, provided the spirit and intent of this section
can be preserved.
(9) Plan preparation and review process. (a) PUDs requiring the
subdivision of property. In PUDs in which property is divided for the
purpose of sale or rental, such as a subdivision or mobile home park, the
following requirements for PUD plan preparation shall apply:
(i) Preliminary PUD Plan. Prior to submitting a
preliminary subdivision plat for review, a preliminary PUD plan
shall be submitted to the planning commission which shall include
the following: the general location of buildings and uses, general
circulation patterns, open space and recreation areas, parking
areas, ingress/egress points, sketch elevations and drainage, the
boundary dimensions, overall density of development, public uses,
landscaping concepts, zoning classification, and other information
deemed pertinent by the planning commission. The approved
preliminary PUD plan shall serve as the plan upon which the final
PUD plan and preliminary subdivision plat are based. Approval
of a preliminary PUD plan shall lapse twelve (12) months from the
date it was approved.
(ii) Final PUD plan/preliminary subdivision plat. In
addition to meeting the applicable provisions of the subdivision
regulations regarding preparation of a preliminary plat, the final
PUD plan shall include detailed architectural/engineering plans
for: utilities, vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems, location
of all structures, topographic intervals at no less than five (5) feet,
14-25
minimum elevations, and grading, the physical relationship of
uses, parking areas, open space and recreation areas, landscaped
areas, buffer or screening materials and locations, areas proposed
for dedication as parks, ways, or places, final drafts of legal
documents, and other information deemed pertinent by the
planning commission. Upon approval of the final PUD plan and
the preliminary subdivision plat by the planning commission,
development may commence with the installation of public
improvements. No lots, however, shall be sold until final
subdivision plat approval has been granted by the planning
commission with all required improvements having either been
installed or appropriate security posted for the installation of such
improvements.
(b) PUDs not requiring the subdivision of property. In PUDs in
which no individual parcel of property is owned or rented, such as
condominium, apartment, commercial, or industrial PUDs, and similar
uses, the following requirements for PUD plan preparation apply:
(i) Preliminary PUD Plan. A concept plan containing
the following information shall be submitted to the planning
commission for review: the general location of buildings and uses,
general circulation patterns, open space and recreation areas,
parking areas, ingress/egress points, sketch elevations and
drainage, the boundary dimensions, overall density of
development, public uses, landscaping concepts, zoning
classification, and other information deemed pertinent by the
planning commission. The approved preliminary PUD plan shall
serve as the plan upon which the final PUD plan is based.
Approval of a preliminary PUD plan shall lapse twelve (12)
months from the date it was approved.
(ii) Final PUD plan. Following approval of a preliminary
PUD plan, the developer may proceed to prepare a final PUD plan
which shall include detailed architectural/engineering plans for:
utilities, vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems, location of
all structures, topographic intervals at no less than five (5) feet,
minimum elevations, and grading, the physical relationship of
uses, parking areas, open space and recreation areas, landscaped
areas, buffer or screening materials and locations, areas proposed
for dedication as parks, ways, or places, final drafts of legal
documents, and other information deemed pertinent by the
planning commission. Upon approval of the final PUD plan, a
special conditions permit may be issued.
(10) Staging of development. The PUD applicant may elect to develop
the site in successive stages. The stages and expected development periods shall
be shown on the preliminary PUD development plan. However, each stage
Change 9, April 28, 2014 14-26
given final PUD approval must be substantially complete within itself. The
planning commission may also require the development of a PUD project in
stages if public facilities are not adequate to handle the entire development
initially.
(11) Permits. The developer of a PUD shall be entitled to receive
appropriate development permits following approval of the final PUD plan and
the preliminary subdivision plat, where applicable. However, none of these
permits shall be issued until the building official receives a PUD plan which
bears the signed certificates of approval and of application and agreement (See
Appendix C for examples).
(12) Changes and modifications. A PUD project may be changed or
modified under conditions established for minor changes and major changes.
(a) Minor changes. The planning commission may approve
changes in minor shifts of building locations, proposed streets and ways,
utilities and easements, recreation and open space areas or other features
on the approved plan. However, these changes shall not increase
densities, change exterior boundary lines, change uses, materially change
location or amount of land devoted to specific uses, or significantly change
the exterior features or appearance of buildings and uses shown on the
approved plans.
(b) Major changes. All changes other than those established as
minor shall be considered as major changes to the PUD plan and shall
require a new plan submission in accordance with the procedures and
requirements for approval of a PUD plan. (Ord. No. 317, sec. 2, as
amended by Ord. #364, § 1, Aug. 1995; and further amended by Ord.
#385, § 1, Feb. 1998)

health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(iii) Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and
velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to
floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated,
flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

community facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time
of initial construction;
(iii) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation floodwaters;
(iv) Control filling, grading, dredging and other
development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(v) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers
which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase
flood hazards to other lands.

"Enclosures."
Non-residential buildings located in all A zones may be
flood-proofed, in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of
the building below the required elevation are watertight, with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and are
built with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
A Tennessee registered professional engineer or architect shall
Change 9, April 28, 2014 14-70
certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the
provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the
administrator as set forth in subsection (4)(b).
(iii) Enclosures. All new construction or substantial
improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by
foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor that are
subject to flooding, shall be designed to preclude finished living
space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.

and
(3) Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided
they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions.
(B) The enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles, storage or
building access.
(C) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall
not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms in such a
way as to impede the movement of floodwaters and all such
petitions shall comply with the provisions of subsection
(5)(b) of this section.
(iv) Standards for manufactured homes and recreational
vehicles.
(A) All manufactured homes placed, or
substantially improved, on:
(1) Individual lots or parcels,
(2) In expansions to existing manufactured
home parks or subdivisions, or
(3) In new or substantially improved
manufactured home parks or subdivisions,
must meet all the requirements of new construction,
including elevations and anchoring.
Change 9, April 28, 2014 14-71
(B) All manufactured homes placed or
substantially improved in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision must be elevated so that either:
(1) In AE zones, with base flood elevations,
the manufactured home is elevated on a permanent
foundation to no lower than one foot (1') above the
level of the base flood elevation or
(2) In approximate A zones, without base
flood elevations the manufactured home chassis is
elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength)
that are at least three (3) feet in height above the
highest adjacent grade (as defined in subsection (2)).
(C) Any manufactured home, which has incurred
"substantial damage" as the result of a flood or that has
substantially improved, must meet the standards of
subsection (5)(a) and (b) of this section.
(D) All manufactured homes must be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
(E) All recreational vehicles placed in an identified
special flood hazard area must either:
(1) Be on the site for fewer than one
hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;
(2) Be fully licensed and ready for highway
use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if
it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system,
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached structures or additions), or;
(3) The recreational vehicle must meet all
the requirements for new construction.
(v) Standards for subdivisions and other proposed new
development proposals. Subdivisions and other proposed new
developments, including manufactured home parks, shall be
reviewed to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably
safe from flooding.
(A) All subdivision and other proposed new
development proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
(B) All subdivision and other proposed new
development proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
Change 9, April 28, 2014 14-72
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
(C) All subdivision and other proposed new
development proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(D) In all approximate A zones require that all new
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home parks and
subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base
flood elevation data (see (5)(e)).
(c) Standards for special flood hazard areas with established
base flood elevations and with floodways designated. Located within the
special flood hazard areas established in subsection (3)(b), are areas
designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous
area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In
addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for
the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and
velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(i) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill
material, new construction, substantial improvements or other
developments within the regulatory floodway. Development may
be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the
proposed encroachments or new development shall not result in
any increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during the occurrence of
a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A
Tennessee registered professional engineer must provide
supporting technical data, using the same methodologies as in the
effective flood insurance study for the City of Clinton, Tennessee
and certification, thereof.
(ii) New construction or substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of subsection (5)(a) and (b).
(d) Standards for areas of special flood hazard zones AE with
established base flood elevations but without floodways designated.
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in subsection
(3)(b), where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no
floodways have been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions
apply:
(i) No encroachments, including fill material, new
construction and substantial improvements shall be located within
Change 9, April 28, 2014 14-73
areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a Tennessee
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
one foot (1') at any point within the community. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms
to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(ii) New construction or substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of subsections (5)(a) and (b).
(e) Standards for streams without established base flood
elevations or floodways (A Zones). Located within the special flood
hazard areas established in subsection (3)(b), where streams exist, but no
base flood data has been provided and where a floodway has not been
delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
(i) The administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other sources, including data
developed as a result of these regulations (see (ii) below), as
criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development in approximate A zones meet
the requirements of subsection (5)(a) and (b).
(ii) Within approximate A zones, require that all new
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including
proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater
than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, include
within such proposals base flood elevation data.
(iii) Within approximate A zones, where base flood
elevations have not been established and where such data is not
available from other sources, require the lowest floor of a building
to be elevated or flood-proofed to a level of at least three feet (3')
above the highest adjacent grade as defined in subsection (2)). All
applicable data including elevations or flood-proofing certifications
shall be recorded as set forth in subsection (4)(b). Openings
sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the
standards of subsection (5)(b).
(iv) Within approximate A zones, where base flood
elevations have not been established and where such data is not
available from other sources, no encroachments, including
structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to
the width of the stream or twenty feet (20'), whichever is greater,
measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by
Change 9, April 28, 2014 14-74
a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point
within the City of Clinton, Tennessee. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms
to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(v) New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of (5)(a) and (b). Within approximate
A zones, require that those subsections of subsection (5)(b) dealing
with the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, assuring
watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and manufactured
homes provisions are complied with as required.
(f) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones).
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in subsection
(3)(b), are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet
(1'-3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions, in addition to those set forth in subsection (5)(a) and (b),
apply:
(i) All new construction and substantial improvements
of residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to at least one foot (1') above as
many feet as the depth number specified on the FIRM's, in feet,
above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is
specified on the FIRM, the lowest floor, including basement, shall
be elevated to at least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent
grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in
accordance with standards of subsection (5)(b).
(ii) All new construction and substantial improvements
of nonresidential buildings may be flood-proofed in lieu of
elevation. The structure together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities must be flood-proofed and designed watertight
to be completely flood-proofed to at least one foot (1') above the
flood depth number specified on the FIRM, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
If no depth number is specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be
flood-proofed to at least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent
Change 9, April 28, 2014 14-75
grade. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this
section and shall provide such certification to the administrator as
set forth above and as required in subsection (4)(b).
(iii) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
(g) Standards for areas protected by flood protection system
(A-99 zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established
in subsection (3)(b), are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a
flood protection system but where base flood elevations have not been
determined. Within these areas (A-99 zones) all provisions of subsections
(4) and (5) shall apply.
(h) Standards for unmapped streams. Located within the City
of Clinton, Tennessee, are unmapped streams where areas of special flood
hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams,
the following provisions shall apply:
(i) No encroachments including fill material or other
development including structures shall be located within an area
of at least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from
the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
one foot (1') at any point within the City of Clinton, Tennessee.
(ii) When a new flood hazard risk zone, and base flood
elevation and floodway data is available, new construction and
substantial improvements shall meet the standards established in
accordance with subsections (4) and (5).
(6) Variance procedures. (a) Municipal board of zoning appeals.
(i) Authority. The City of Clinton, Tennessee Municipal
Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from the requirements of this section.
(ii) Procedure. Meetings of the municipal board of zoning

regulations does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the yard or
other requirements of the zoning regulations, an application may be submitted
to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance from the terms of the zoning

following findings:
(1) The size or shape of the lot or the location of the principal structure
on the lot will not permit the construction of a carport or garage in a manner
that will meet the current setback requirements of this ordinance.
(2) That the construction of a carport or garage will not have a
detrimental affect on the safety of adjoining properties or damage the aesthetic
character of the surrounding neighborhood.
(3) That the current setback requirements of the ordinance be followed
as closely as possible, except that, no carport or garage shall be constructed less
than five (5) feet from any property line unless a letter of consent first be
obtained from the adjacent property owner. (Ord. No. 317, sec. 2)
14-804. Front yards. The front yard setback requirements of this

on the same street as such lot, is less than the minimum required front yard
Change 7, July 17, 2006 14-112
depth. In such case, the minimum front yard shall be the average of the existing
front yard depths on the developed lots. (Ord. No. 317, sec. 2)
14-805. Exceptions on height limits. The height limitations of this
ordinance shall not apply to any structure not intended for human occupancy,
including but not limited to church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, and
chimneys attached to residential structures. Such structures including, but not
limited to monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission towers,
windmills, chimneys, smokestacks, derricks, conveyors, flag poles, radio towers,

Application for a building permit shall be made to the building official. (Ord.
No. 317, sec. 2)

completion of the development activity as it was approved. Planned Unit
Developments (PUD's) shall be null and void twelve (12) months from the date
of approval if substantial progress has not been made toward completion of the
development activity as it was approved.
The building official may grant any number of ninety (90) day extensions
to a building permit holder for a building permit, if just cause can be given to
justify the extension and if progress toward completion of the project can be
shown.
(2) Abandonment of permitted projects. Any project for which a
building permit has been issued and where an accessory or principal building
has only been partially constructed at the end of one (1) year and for which an
application for extension has not been submitted, may be subject to being
considered as an unsafe and illegal building and may be subject to the
provisions of section 102.4 of the Southern Standard Building Code and any

in the application for the building permit. If such a certificate is refused, the
building official shall state such refusal in writing with the cause. No land or
building hereafter erected or altered in its use shall be used until such a
certificate of occupancy has been granted. (Ord. No. 317, sec. 2)

licensed to practice medicine, resulting in an equal degree of disability
(specifying the particular condition) so as not to be able to get about
without great difficulty, including impairments that, regardless of cause
or manifestation, confine such person to a wheelchair or cause such
person to walk with difficulty or insecurity and includes, but is not
limited to, those persons using braces or crutches, arthritics, spastics and
those with pulmonary or cardia ills who may be semi-ambulatory;

improperly parked vehicles may be towed and the driver fined one
hundred dollars ($100.00), and shall also provide the names and phone
number of the towing company or the name and phone number of the
property owner, lessee or agent in control of the property. However,

reasonable notice of the specially marked parking space.
15-25

park a vehicle of any kind or description in a handicapped parking space unless
he or she meets both of the following conditions:

reasonably could restrict, a person confined to a wheelchair from exiting or
entering a motor vehicle property parked within such handicapped parking
space.
(4) No person shall park a vehicle as to block or impede access to a

authorized to post temporary signs or place temporary restrictions on parking
upon any street or parking area within this city provided, however, such

plate or placard as prescribed by section 15-613(2) above, and which is parked
in a handicapped parking space designated with the wheelchair disabled sign,
is subject to being towed or removed. When such a vehicle has been towed or
removed pursuant to this paragraph, it shall be released to its owner, or person
in lawful possession, upon demand, provided that such person making demand
for return pays all reasonable towing and storage charges and that such demand
is made during the operating hours of the towing company. (as added by ord.
No. 338 and replaced by ord. No. 343)

excavation in any street, alley, or public place, or to tunnel under any street,
alley, or public place without having first obtained a permit as herein required,
and without complying with the provisions of this chapter; and it shall also be
unlawful to violate, or vary from, the terms of any such permit; provided,
however, any person maintaining pipes, lines, or other underground facilities in
or under the surface of any street may proceed with an opening without a permit
when emergency circumstances demand the work to be done immediately and
a permit cannot reasonably and practicably be obtained beforehand. The person
shall thereafter apply for a permit on the first regular business day on which the
office of the city manager is open for business, and the permit shall be
retroactive to the date when the work was begun. (1969 Code, sec. 12-101)
16-202. Applications. Applications for such permits shall be made to the

and shall insure the proper restoration of the ground and, laying of the
pavement, if any. Where the amount of the deposit is clearly inadequate to
cover the cost of restoration, the city manager may increase the amount of the
deposit to an amount considered by him to be adequate to cover the cost. From
this deposit shall be deducted the expense to the city of relaying the surface of
the ground or pavement, and of making the refill if this is done by the city or
at its expense. The balance shall be returned to the applicant without interest
after the tunnel or excavation is completely refilled and the surface or pavement

division be placed in separate funds so that each division shall be selfsustaining.
Each of the system's divisions shall be operated independent of the
others except insofar as the board may be of the opinion that joint operations
shall be advisable and economical. In the event of such joint operations, the
expenses of such operations shall be prorated between the separate divisions in
such manner as the board determines to be reasonable.
(2) Use of utility funds. All utility revenues shall be directed to the
provision of utility services and not applied to the general fund of the city,

be paid from the revenues of the system. All contracts and agreements made by
the board or pursuant to authority granted by the board shall contain a
provision stating the revenues from which the obligations incurred thereunder
are payable, but the failure to include such a provision in any contract shall not
prevent the application of the limitation on the system's or city's liability

SUBDIVISION REGULAT[ONS
OF
CLINTON, TENNESSEE REGIONAL PLANNING COMl\1ISSION
(Hereafter referred to as the planning commission)
ARTICLE I. PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, AND JURISDICTION
A. Purpose
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of
community development. Once land has been cut up into
streets, lots, and blocks and publicly recorded, the
correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision
of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in
that roads and streets must be maintained and various public
services cu·stomary to urban areas must be provided. The
welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many
important respects. It is, therefore, to the interest of the
public, the developer, and the future owners that
subdivisions be conceived, designed, and developed in
accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards.
The following subdivision standards guiding the planning
commission are designed to provide for the harmonious
development of the regional area, to secure a coordinated
layout and adequate provision for traffic, and also to secure
adequate provision for light, air, recreation,
transportation, water, freedom from flood, drainage, sewer,
and other sanitary facilities.
B. Authority
These subdivision standards are adopted under the authority
granted by Sections 13-4-301 through 13-4-309 and 13-3-401
through 13-3-411, Tennessee Code Annotated. The planning
commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in these
statutes as prerequisite to the adoption of such standards,
having filed a certified copy of the Major Road Plan in the
Office of the Register of Anderson County, Tennessee.
C. .I nrisdiction
These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within
the corporate limits of Clinton, Tennessee, as now or
hereafter established and within the Clinton Planning Region
as established by resolution of the Tennessee State Planning
Office. Within these regulations the term "subdivision"
shall mean the division of a tract or parcel of land into two
1
(2) or more lots,- sites or other divisions for the purpose,
whether immediate or future, of sale or building development,
and includes resubdivision and, when appropriate to the
context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land
or area subdivided, provided, however, that "subdivision"
does not include a division of any tract or parcel of land
into two (2) or more tracts or parcels when such parts or
parcels are five (5) acres or larger in size. The term
"road" shall mean, related to and include roads, streets,
highways, avenues, boulevards, park-ways, lanes, 0 or other ways
or any part thereof. The term "plat" shall mean plat, plan,
plot, or replot. The term "planning commission" shall mean
any regional planning commission established by the state
planning office as provided by law, and includes any
municipal planning coro:mission designated by the state
planning office as the regional planning commission of a
planning region composed of the territory of a single
municipality together with the territory adjoining but
outside of such municipality. Any prospective subdivider
owning land located within the Clinton Planning Region shall
submit his subdivision plat the Clinton Regional Planning
Commission. The plat is to be submitted according to the
procedures outlined in Article II, which plat shall conform
to the minimum requirements set forth in Article III.
Improvements shall be installed as required by Article IV of
these regulations.
2
ARTICLE II. PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat
consists of two (2) separate steps. The initial step is the
preparation and submission to the planning commission of a
preliminary sketch plat of the proposed subdivision. The second
step is the preparation and submission to the planning commission
of a final plat together with required certificates. This final
plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the off ice of the
county register of deeds when duly signed by the secretary of the
planning commission.
The subdivider shall consult early and informally with the
planning commission and its technical staff for advice and
assistance before the preparation of the preliminary sketch plat
and its formal application for approval. This will enable him to
become thoroughly familiar with these regulations, the Major Road
Plan, and other official plans or public improvements which might
affect the area. Such informal review should prevent unnecessary
and costly revisions.
A. General
1. Any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction
of the planning commission who wishes to divide such land
into two (2) or more lots, sites, or divisions for the
purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building
development, or who wishes to resubdivide for this
purpose, shall submit a plan of such proposed subdivision
to the planning commission for approval and shall obtain
such approval prior to the filing of his subdivision plat
for record. Any such plat of subdivision shall conform
to the minimum standards of design for the subdivision of
land as set forth in Article III of these standards and
shall be presented in the manner specified in the
following sections of this Article. No plat of a
subdivision of land within the area of planning
jurisdiction shall be filed or recorded by the county
register without the approval of the planning commission
as specified herein.
2. In order to secure review and approval by the planning
commission of a proposed subdivision, the prospective
subdivider shall, prior to the making of any st~eet
improvements or installations of utilities, submit to the
planning commission a preliminary sketch plat as provided
in Section B of this Article. On approval of said
preliminary sketch plat he may proceed with the
preparation of the final plat and other documents
required in connection therewith as specified in Section
C of this Article and the improvements set forth in
Article IV.
3
3. A subdivider may omit the submission of a prelii~inary
plat if all public improvements as set forth in Article
IV are already installed.

ARTICLE ill. GENERAL REQU1REMEI\l'TS Af.fD lYIINllVlUM STANDARDS OF
DESIGN
A Streets
1. Confonnitv to the Major Road Plan.
The location and width of all streets and roads shall
conform to the official Major Road Plan.
2. Relation to Adjoining Street System.
The proposed street system shall extend existing streets
or projects. They shall be extended at a width no less
than the required minimum width.
3. Street Elevation.
No street shall be approved if it is more than two (2)
feet lower than the elevation of the TVA Structure
Profile. Fill may be used for streets, provided such
fill does not unduly increase flood heights. Drainage
openings shall be so designed as to not restrict the flow
of water .and unduly increase flood heights.
The street pattern shall be designed so that in time of
flood each lot shall be readily accessible to emergency
vehicles.
4. Access Streets to Subdivision Boundaries.
Sufficient access streets to adjoining properties shall
be provided within subdivisions to permit harmonious
development of the area.
5. Street Widths.
The minimum width of right-of-way, measured from lot line
to lot line, shall be as shown on the Major Road Plan, or
if not shown on such plan, shall be not less than as
follows:
a. Arterial Streets and Highways. .80-150 feet;
as may be required
Arterial streets and highways are
those to be used primarily for fast
or heavy traffic and will be located
on the Major Road Plan.
15
b. Major Collector Streets . . 70-80 feet;
as may be required
Major collector streets are those
which carry traffic from lesser
travelled streets to arterial
streets and highways.
c. Local Collector Streets ..
Local collector streets are those
which carry traffic from local
streets to the major system of
arterial and major collector streets
and include the principal entrance
streets of a residential development
and streets for major circulation
within such a development.
d. Local Streets .
Local Streets are minor streets
which are used primarily for access
to abutting properties and designed
to discourage through traffic.
Residential streets, access streets,
dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs), and
other similar streets are considered
local streets.
6. Additional Width on Existin[ Streets.
.60 feet
.50 feet
Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate
additional right-of-way to meet the above minimum street
width requirements.
a. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any
part of the subdivision is on both sides of the
existing street.
b. When the subdivision is located on only one side of
an existing street, one-half (1/2) of the required
right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the
existing roadway, shall be provided.
7. Road Improvements.
All streets and roads shall be improved by the developer
or subdivider as specified in Article IV. A. 1-10. If an
existing, approved public street is inadequate to serve a
proposed development, the developer may be required to
improve the existing street to approved city standards.
16
8. Restriction ofAccess.
When a subdivision fronts on an arterial, major
collector, or local collector street or highway, the
planning commission may require any one or a combinatfon
of the following:
a. Shared driveways between two lots;
b. Access to corner lots being restricted to one street,
usually the lower classified street;
c. Marginal access streets;
d. Reverse frontage with screened plantings contained in
a non-access reservation along the rear property
line; and
e. Any other treatment as may necessary for adequate
protection for residential properties and for safer
ingress/egress from the subdivided properties.
9. Street Grades.
Grades on arterial, major collector, and local collector
streets or highways shall not exceed seven (7) percent.
Grades on local streets shall not exceed ten (10)
percent.
10. Horizontal Curves.
Where a deflection angle of more than ten (10) degrees in
the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably
long radius shall be introduced. Arterial, major
collector, and local collector streets shall be designed
for a minimum speed of 40 miles per hour. The centerline
radius of curvature for these streets shall not be less
than four hundred and fifty (450) feet. If the design
speed is greater than 40 miles per hour, the centerline
radius of curvature shall be increased accordingly.
Local streets shall be designed for a minimum speed of 30
miles per hour. The centerline radius of curvature for
these streets shall not be less than two·hundred and
fifty (250) feet. If the design speed is greater than 30
miles per hour, the centerline radius of curvature shall
be increased accordingly. See page 19 for illustration.
17
11. Vertical Curves.
Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical
curve constructed so as to afford a minimum sight
distance of two hundred ( 200) .feet. Sight distance shall
be measured from the driver's eyes, which are assumed to
be four and one-half (4-1/2) feet above the pavement
surface, to an object four (4) inches high on the
pavement. Profiles of all streets showing natural and
finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than one (1)
inch equals one hundred (100) feet horizontal, and one
(1) inch equals twenty (20) feet vertical, shall be
required for all proposed streets. See page 19 for
illustration.
12. Intersections.
Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles
as is possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle
of less than sixty (60) degrees.
Property line radii at street intersections shall not be
less than twenty (20) feet. Where the angle of street
intersection is less than seventy-five (75) degrees, the
planning commission may require a greater curb radius.
Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb
having a desirable radius without curtailing the sidewalk
at a street corner to less than normal width, the
property line at such street corner shall be rounded or
otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such
construction. See pages 19 and 20 for illustrations.
13. Tanff.ents.
A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet in length
shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial,
major collector, and local collector streets when the
design speed is 40 miles per hour. If the design speed
is greater than 40 miles per hour, the tangent shall be
increased accordingly.
A tangent of at least fifty (50) feet in length shall be
introduced between reverse curves on local streets when
the design speed is 30 miles per hour. If the design
speed is greater than 30 miles per hour, the tangent
shall be increased accordingly. See page 21 for
illustration.
14. Street Jogs.
Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than two
hundred (200) feet shall not be allowed. See page 21 for
illustration.

15. Dead-End Streets.
a. Cul-de-sacs shall be provided at the closed end with
a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at
least eighty (80) feet and a street right-of~way
diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet and shall
be no more than six hundred (600) feet long unless
necessitated by topography. "T" and "Y" backaround
des.igns may be used provided they are approved by the
planning commission. Design requirements are shown
on the illustration on page 23.
b. Where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it
is desirable to provide for street access to
adjoining property, proposed streets shall be
extended to the boundary of such property. Such
dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary
turnaround.
16. Private Streets and Reserve Strips.
There shall be no private streets platted in any
subdivision. Every lot in subdivided property shall be
served from a publicly dedicated street. There shall be
no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except
where the control of such strips is definitely placed
with the community under conditions approved by the
planning commission.
17. Street Names.
Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with
others already existing and named shall bear the names of
existing streets. In no case shall the name for proposed
streets duplicate existing street names, irrespective of
the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive,
way, place or court. The planning commission and the
Anderson County E-911 officer can assist the subdivider
in avoiding duplication.
18. Drainage.
All streets, roads and/or ditches shall be designed so as
to provide for the discharge of surface water from the
right-of-way. In order to prevent the off-site flooding
of streets and ditches from this additional surface water
run-off, the installation of storm water retention areas
capable of storing runoff from a ten year storm shall be
required or a storm sewer system shall be constructed.
25
B. Blocks
1. Length.
Blocks shall not be less than four hundred (400) feet nor
more than twelve hundred (1,200) feet in length, except
as the planning commission considers necessary to secure
efficient use of land or desired features of street
pattern. In blocks over eight hundred (800) feet in
length, the planning commission may require one (1) or
more public crosswalks of not less than ten (10) feet in
width to extend entirely across the block and at
locations deemed necessary.
2. Width.
C. Lots
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two (2) rows of
lots, except where reverse frontage on arterial, major
collector, or local collector streets is provided.
1 . Arrangement.
a. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at
right angles to straight street lines or radial to
curved street lines. Each lot must front for a
minimum of forty (40) feet upon a public street or
road. Parcels larger than ordinary building lots
shall front for a minimum of fifty (50) feet upon a
public street or road to facilitate further
subdividing in the future.
b. Where a significant elevation difference exists
between the roadway and the right-of-way line, lot
frontage shall be increased as necessary to guarantee
accessibility to the building site by a driveway
which does not exceed a ten (10) percent grade. Offstreet
parking requirements provided by the zoning
ordinance shall also be taken into account.
2. Minimum Size.
a. All lots shall conform to the zoning ordinance. Lots
without a public water supply shall be a minimum
requirement established by the Tennessee Department
of Conservation and Environment.
b. Greater area may be required for private sewage
disposal if, in the opinion of officials from
appropriate agencies, such as the Tennessee
Department of Conservation and Environment, the
Department of Agriculture, and the Soil Conservation
Office, there are factors of drainage, soils, geology
26
I
I
I
-1
or other conditions that may pose potential health
problems.
c. Size of properties reserved or laid out for
commercial or industrial properties shall be adequate
to provide for the off-street service and parking
facilities required by the type of use and
development contemplated. Platting of individual
lots should be avoided in favor of an overall design
of the land to be used for such purposes. ·
3. Adequate Building Sites.
Each lot shall contain a building site not subject to
flood, and each lot shall contain a building site free
from sinkholes and drainageways. Each building site
shall be outside the limits of any existing easement or
building setback line required in the applicable zoning
regulations.
D. Public Use and Service Areas
Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas
suitably located and of adequate size for playgrounds and
parks for local or neighborhood use as well as public service
areas.
1. Public Open Space.
Where a school, neighborhood park, recreation area, or
public access to water frontage as shown on an official
map or in a plan made and adopted by the planning
commission, is located in whole or in part in the
applicant's subdivision, the Planning Commission may
require the dedication or reservation of such open space
within the subdivision up to a total of ten (10) percent
of the gross area or water frontage of the plat for park,
school, or recreation purposes.
2. Easements for Utilities.
Easements not exceeding twelve (12) feet in width shall
be required along side and rear lot lines for the
placement of poles, wire, conduits, storm and sanitary
sewers, gas, water and heat mains, or any other utility
lines. Easements of the same or greater width may be
required along the property lines of or across lots,
where necessary, for the extension of existing or planned
utilities. Each cul-de-sac shall have provisions for a
utility easement therefrom to prevent dead-end water
mains.
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided
27
a storm water easement or drainage easement along each
side for the purpose of widening 1 deepening, relocating,
in1proving, or protecting such drainage easement.
3. Stonn Water Retention Areas and Stonn Sewers.
All streets, roads, ditches, and parking areas shall be
designed so as to provide for the discharge of surface
water. In order to prevent off-site flooding of streets
and ditches from this additional surface water run-off,
the installation of storm water retention areas capable
of storing runoff from a ten-year storm shall be required
or a storm sewer system shall be constructed. ·
4. CommunitvAssets.
In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for all
natural features such as large trees, water courses,
historical spots, and similar community assets which, if
preserved, will retain the attractiveness and
environmental quality of the property.
5. Water Supply and Sewerage Connections.
Where a public water supply or public sewerage system is
reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall indicate a
connection with such water supply or sewerage system. In
addition, a water and sewerage connection for each lot
with such material and to such size and length as to meet
the requirements of the City of Clinton and the Clintion
Utilities Board shall be approved by the planning
commission. Where a public water supply or public
sewerage system is not reasonably accessible or not
planned for in the future, an alternate method of water
supply and sewage disposal may be indicated and shall be
approved in writing by the county health officer.
E. Snitability of the Land
Land which the planning commission, staff, and all other
public agencies concerned has found to be unsuitable for
subdivision due to flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock
formations, or other features likely to be harmful to the
future residents, shall not be subdivided unless adequate
methods designed by a certified engineer are formulated for
meeting the requirements of these regulations.
F. Land Subject to Flooding
Land subject to flooding shall not be platted for residential
occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase danger to
health, life, or property or aggravate erosion of flood
hazard. Such land within the plat shall be set aside for
such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or
28
I
occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory
living conditions.
For the purposes of these standards, land subject to flooding
shall be defined as follows:
L Land lying along the Clinch River (Melton Hill Reservoir)
and below the level of the TVA Structure Profile as shall
be determined from the chart, "High Water Profiles,
Clinch River, Vicinity of Clinton, Tennessee'' (Tennessee
Valley Authority, November 1960, Revised February 1969).
2. Land lying along small streams and drainage channels,
hereafter referred to as streams, and land within 100
feet of the top of the bank. The planning commission may
reduce the distance from the top of the bank if it is
demonstrated that the reduction will not increase the
danger to health, life, or property. In no case,
however, will structures be permitted nearer than ten
(10) feet to a stream bank.
G. Flood Control Measures
1. Fill may not be used to raise land in areas where the
fill would increase flood levels.
2. All proposed subdivisions containing land subject to
flood shall identify the f loodway and flood fringe areas
on the plat and state the Base Flood Elevation (BFE).
3. All subdivisions shall have all public utilities and
facil·ities located and constructed in such a manner as to
minimize flood damage.
~ All subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
H. Erosion and Sedimentation Control
For all proposed subdivisions, erosion and sedimentation
control plans prepared by a certified engineer shall be
presented to the planning commission and shall meet the
following standards. No plans shall.be required for minor
subdivision plats, however, the building official may require
plans to be submitted at the•time a building permit is
applied for.
L Topography.
The development plan shall be fitted to the topography
and the soils in order to minimize erosion potential.
29
2. Development Coordination.
Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
coordinated with the required steps in construction, and
appropriate control measures installed prior to the start
of construction.
3. Sequential Control Measures.
Land shall be developed in increments of workable size,
on which, adequate controls of erosion and sedimentation
can be provided and maintained during the construction
period. Operations shall be staged so that the area
being developed is not being exposed for a long period of
time without stabilization and so that the initial
disturbed areas are completely controlled before the next
section is opened. The developer shall be required to
schedule sequentially phased controls of erosion and
sedimentation as coordinated with the development and
construction stages, and shall specify in detail
precisely which areas will be cleared first, and how long
these areas will be exposed to the elements. The maximum
exposure period shall not exceed one hundred twenty (120)
days.
4. Runoff Controls.
Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions
during the ensuing development. Runoff shall be
intercepted and safely conveyed to storm drains,
retention ponds, or natural outlets where it will not
erode or flood land. The drainage system for the
development shall be completed and made operational as
quickly as possible during construction and shall be
prepared by a certified landscape a.rchitect or civil
engineer. In the event sediment covers adjacent roadways
and fills adjacent ditches, the developer shall be
required to clean the roadways and empty the ditches.·
5. Cover.
Wherever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained
.and protected. Temporary vegetation and/or mulching
shall be used where necessary to protect exposed areas
during development.
6. Sediment Basins, Debris Basins, DesiltingBasins, or Silt Traps.
Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins, or silt
traps. shall be installed and maintained to collect
sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing
development. Storm sewer inlets with debris guards and
30
micro silt basins shall be provided to trap sediment and
avoid possible damage by blockage.
7. Final Vegetation and Structures.
The permanent vegetation and structures shall be
installed as soon as practical in the development.
8. Paved Areas.
Streets, parking lots, and other areas shall be paved as
quickly as practical.
I. Large Tracts or Parcels
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary
building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow
for the opening of future streets and logical further
resubdivision. A minimum of fifty (50) feet road frontage
shall be maintained for these larger parcels.
J. Planned Unit Developments
Planned unit developments shall follow all regulations and
requirements of the Clinton Zoning Ordinance, particularly
Sections 11-308, 11-310, and 11-311. Planned unit
developments shall also generally comply with the standards
established in these regulations. Due to the uniqueness of
each proposed development, however, these standards may be
modified by the planning commission provided their intent is
preserved.
1. A planned unit development plat shall show the
appropriate subdivision of properties.
2. Each development shall follow all road standards as
stated in these regulations, however, pavement widths may
be decreased, provided:
a. Paved sidewalks, a minimum of four (4) feet in width,
are constructed throughout the development; and
b. Driveways, a minimum of twenty-two (22) feet in width
and which provides four (4) off-street parking
spaces, are constructed for each unit in order to
eliminate the need for any on-street parking.
3. All multi-family, commercial, or industrial planned unit
developments shall be served by public water and sanitary
sewer. Fire hydrants shall also be installed.
31
1(. V.a1iances
Variances may be granted under the following conditions'
1. Where the subdivider can show that strict adherence to
these regulations would cause unnecessary hardship, or
2. Where the planning commission determines that there are
topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site,
and a departure from these regulations will not destroy
their intent. Any variance thus authorized and the
reasons thereof shall be stated in writing in the minutes
of the planning commission.
JL. Zoning and Other Regulations
All final and minor subdivision plats shall comply with the
requirements of the Clinton Zoning Ordinance and all other
applicable state and local regulations which are in.effect at
the time of planning commission review and approval.
Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or
dimensions noted herein and those contained in the Clinton
Zoning Ordinance, building code, or other official

ARTICLE IV. DEVELOPMENT PREREQUISITE TO FINAL APPROVAL
A perfect~y prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means
little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual
physical transformation of raw acreage into lots suitable for
building purposes and human habitation. Improvements by the
subdivider spare the community from a potential tax liability.
The following tangible improvements are required before final
plat approval in order to assure the physical reality of a
subdivision which approval and recordation will establish
legally.
A. Reguired Improvements
Every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and
improve streets and alleys, and to install needed curbs,
monuments, sewers, storm water inlets and retention areas,
and water mains in accordance with specifications established
by the Clinton Municipal/Regional Planning Commission. Where
specifications adopted by local authorities conflict.with
standards as set forth in these subdivision regulations, the
higher set of standards, as determined by the planning
commission, shall govern.
1. Monuments.
a. Concrete monuments four (4) inches in diameter or
square, three (3) feet long, with a flat top, shall
be set at all street corners, at all points where the
street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the
subdivision, and at angle points and points of curb
in each street. The top of the monuments shall have
an indented cross to identify properly the location
and shall be set flush with the finished grade.
b. All other corners and points shall be marked with
iron pins.
2. Grading.
All streets, roads, and alleys shall be graded or filled
horizontally to the full width of their rights-of-way by
the subdivider or developer.
a. Preparation. Before grading is started, necessary
parts of the right-of-way area shall be cleared of
all trees, stumps, roots, brush and other
objectionable materials.
33
b. Cuts. All tree stumps, boulders and other
obstructions shall be removed to a depth of two (2)
feet below the subgrade. Rock, when encountered,
shall be scarified to a depth of twelve (12) inches
below subgrade. ,
c. Fill. All suitable material from roadway cuts may be
used in the construction of fills, approaches, or at
other places as needed. Excess materials including
organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall be removed
from the development site. The fill shall be spread
in layers not to exceed six (6) inches loose and
compacted by a sheep's foot roller. Unless another
method of preparation of the subgrade is approved by
the planning commission, the subgrade shall be
constructed as specified in Section 203, Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction,
Tennessee Department of Highways and Public Works -
March 1, 1981, and later revisions thereto. The
filling of utility trenches and other places not
accessible to a roller shall be mechanically tamped,
and where water is used to assist compaction, the
water content shall not exce.ed the optimum of moisture.
3. Storm Drainage.
An adequate drainage system, including storm sewers,
storm water retention areas, necessary open ditches,
pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets,
bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage
of all surface water.
Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural
water flow and shall be of sufficient length to permit
full width roadway and the required slopes. The site
openings to be provided shall be determined by Talbot's
formula (Appendix B), but in no case shall the pipe be
less than eighteen (18) inches. Cross drains shall be
built on straight line and grade and shall be laid on a
firm base but not on rock. Pipes shall be laid with
spigot end pointing in the direction of the flow and with
the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a
smooth uniform invert. They shall be placed at a
sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous
pressure of impact, and in no case shall the top of the
pipe be less than one (1) foot below the roadbed.
4. Roadway Improvements.
a. Base, A compacted base course six (6) inches deep
and two (2) feet wider than the width of the pavement
on each side of the street shall be installed on all
streets, including cul-de-sacs, temporary turn-

base is applied, all of the underground works - water
mains, gas mains, sewer mains, etc., and all service
connections shall be installed completely and approved
throughout the length of the road and across the flat
section. Water mains and sewer mains shall be installed
at this time and sealed off if these services are
currently not available. This is to ensure that these
services will become available to residents as soon as
main lines are extended into the area.
All driveways for houses to be built by the developer
shall be cut and drained. Driveways leading to-the
building site shall not exceed a ten (10) percent grade.
8. Water supply system.

extended into the area.
9. Sanitary Sewers.
Where lots cannot be economically connected with a
community sewerage system, they must contain adequate
area for the installation of approved septic tank and
disposal fields and must be approved in writing by the
county health officer and comply with the sewer sys.tern
regulations of the City of Clinton.
Sewer mains shall be installed prior to road construction
and sealed off if public sewer is currently not
available. This is to ensure that public sewer will
become available to residents as soon as a sewer main is

and utilities installed without cost to the city in the
event of default of the subdivider. The conditions of
such security shall provide for the installation of the
improvements covered by such within a period of no_t to
exceed one (1) year; provided, however, that such period
may be extended by the planning commission with the
consent of the parties thereto if the planning commission
finds that the public interest will not be adv~rsely
affected by such extension.
If the planning commission shall decide at any time
during the security that the extent of the building
development that has taken place in the subdivision is
not sufficient to warrant all the improvements covered by
such security, that required improvements have been
installed as provided in this section in sufficient
amount to warrant reduction in the face amount of said
security, or that· the character and the extent of such
development requires additional improvements -for any or
all such improvements, the face value of such security
shall thereupon be reduced or increased by an appropriate
amount so that the new face amount will cover the cost in
full of the amended list of improvements.
All bonds which are submitted in lieu of the installation
of required improvements shall be in cash or made by a
surety company authorized to do business in the State of

Commission. In the event that it places an extreme and undue
hardship on the developer or selling agent a special review
committee may review the subdivision prior to the regular
monthly meeting. The special review committee may grant
tentative approval and permission to sell pending official
approval by the Clinton Planning Commission. The following
