Preface
The Pigeon Forge Municipal Code contains the codification and revision
of the ordinances of the City of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. By referring to the
historical citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine
the origin of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means
that the section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical
citation indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have
been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the
user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for a
comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 8 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
iii
(3) That the city agrees to reimburse MTAS for the actual costs of
reproducing replacement pages for the code (no charge is made for the
consultant's work, and reproduction costs are usually nominal).
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of Bobbie J. Sams, the MTAS Word Processing
Specialist who did all the typing on this project, and Tracy Gardner,
Administrative Services Assistant, is gratefully acknowledged.

subject of a vote by a municipal board nor otherwise regulated by state
statutes on conflicts of interests; or

matter to be regulated or supervised; or

interest under state law, the provisions of the state law take precedence over the
provisions of this chapter. (as added by Ord. #830, June 2007)
Change 11, November 10, 2008 1-6
1-303. Disclosure of personal interest by official with vote. An
official with the responsibility to vote on a measure shall disclose during the
meeting at which the vote takes place, before the vote and so it appears in the

official shall recuse himself from voting on the measure. (as added by
Ord. #830, June 2007)
1-304. Disclosure of personal interest in non-voting matters. An
official or employee who must exercise discretion relative to any matter, other

or that would lead a reasonable person to infer that it affects the exercise of the
discretion shall disclose, before the exercise of the discretion when possible, the
interest on a form provided by and filed with the recorder. In addition, the
official or employee may, to the extent allowed by law, charter, ordinance, or
policy, recuse himself from the exercise of discretion in the matter. (as added
by Ord. #830, June 2007)
1-305. Acceptance of gratuities, etc. An official or employee may not
accept, directly or indirectly, any money, gift, gratuity, or other consideration
or favor of any kind from anyone other than the municipality:
1. For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of
an act, that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the
regular course of his duties; or
2. That might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence
his action, or reward him for past action, in executing municipal business. (as
added by Ord. #830, June 2007)
1-306. Use of information. 1. An official or employee may not disclose
any information obtained in his official capacity or position of employment that
is made confidential under state or federal law except as authorized by law.
2. An official or employee may not use or disclose information
obtained in his official capacity or position of employment with the intent to
result in financial gain for himself or any other person or entity. (as added by
Ord. #830, June 2007)
1-307. Use of municipal time, facilities, etc. 1. An official or
employee may not use or authorize the use of municipal time, facilities,
equipment, or supplies for private gain or advantage to himself.

municipal time, facilities, equipment, or supplies for private gain or advantage
to any private person or entity, except as authorized by legitimate contract or
lease that is determined by the governing body to be in the best interests of the
municipality. (as added by Ord. #830, June 2007)
Change 11, November 10, 2008 1-7

not make or attempt to make private purchases, for cash or otherwise, in the
name of the municipality.

by the charter, general law, or ordinance or policy of the municipality. (as added
by Ord. #830, June 2007)
1-309. Outside employment. An official or employee may not accept or
continue any outside employment if the work unreasonably inhibits the
performance of any affirmative duty of the municipal position or conflicts with
any provision of the municipality's charter or any ordinance or policy. (as added
by Ord. #830, June 2007)
1-310. Ethics complaints. 1. The city attorney is designated as the
ethics officer of the municipality. Upon the written request of an official or
employee potentially affected by a provision of this chapter, the city attorney
may render an oral or written advisory ethics opinion based upon this chapter
and other applicable law.
2. a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city
attorney shall investigate any credible complaint against an appointed
official or employee charging any violation of this chapter, or may
undertake an investigation on his own initiative when he acquires
information indicating a possible violation, and make recommendations
for action to end or seek retribution for any activity that, in attorney's
judgment, constitutes a violation of this code of ethics.
b. The city attorney may request the governing body hire
another attorney, individual, or entity to act as ethics officer when he has
or will have a conflict of interests in a particular matter.
c. When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this
chapter is lodged against a member of the municipality's governing body,
the governing body shall either determine that the complaint has merit,
determine that the complaint does not have merit, or determine that the
complaint has sufficient merit to warrant further investigation. If the
governing body determines that a complaint warrants further
investigation, it shall authorize an investigation by the city attorney or
another individual or entity chosen by the governing body.
3. The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances
would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
4. When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule, or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel or
civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code of ethics. (as added
by Ord. #830, June 2007)
Change 11, November 10, 2008 1-8
1-311. Violations. An elected official or appointed member of a separate
municipal board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other
instrumentality who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
punishment as provided by the municipality's charter or other applicable law,
and in addition is subject to censure by the governing body. An appointed official
or an employee who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
disciplinary action. (as added by Ord. #830, June 2007)

Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, title 11, chapter 24 there is hereby
created a city "recreation commission"" which shall consist of the mayor, city
manager, and five (5) Pigeon Forge residents, to be appointed by the board of
commissioners to serve for terms of five (5) years or until their successors are
appointed. However, the first appointive members shall be appointed for such
terms that the term of one (1) member shall expire annually thereafter. The
members of the recreation commission shall serve without pay. Any vacancy in
the commission occurring otherwise than by expiration of a term shall be filled
only for the unexpired term, and such appointment shall be made by the board
of commissioners. (1979 Code, § 1-1201)
2-102. General powers and duties. The recreation commission is
hereby empowered and directed to provide, establish, maintain, and conduct a
supervised recreation program for residents of the City of Pigeon Forge, utilizing
such playgrounds, recreation centers, and other land, facilities, and
appropriations as the board of commissioners may designate or appropriate for
recreational activities. Utilizing only such funds as may be appropriated for the
recreation commission's use by the board of commissioners and such additional
funds as it may receive gratuitously, the city manager may, in consultation with
the recreation director, if that position is filled at the time, employ play leaders,
playground directors, supervisors, recreation superintendents, and such other
officers or employees as the recreation commission deems proper. (1979 Code,
§ 1-1202)

may accept any grant or devise of real estate or any gift or bequest of money or
other personal property or any donation to be applied, principal or income, for
either temporary or permanent use for playgrounds or recreation purposes, but
if the acceptance thereof for such purpose will subject the city to additional
expense for improvement, maintenance, or renewal, the acceptance of any grant
or devise of real estate shall be subject to the approval of the board of
commissioners. Money received for such purpose, unless otherwise provided by
the terms of the gift or bequest, shall be deposited by the recorder of the city to
the account of the recreation commission and the same may be withdrawn and
paid out in the same manner as money appropriated for recreational purposes.
(1979 Code, § 1-1203)
2-104. Powers reserved to the board of commissioners. It is
intended and hereby expressly provided that the recreation commission shall
have only those powers herein granted. The board of commissioners expressly
reserves to itself all powers to purchase, condemn, or lease lands and buildings;
to issue bonds; and to levy taxes for recreational purposes. (1979 Code,
§ 1-1204)

CHAPTER 2
EDUCATION FUNDING BOARD
SECTION
2-201. Board created.
2-201. Board created. There shall be hereby created an educational
funding board which shall exist and operate under the following terms and
conditions:
(1) Said board shall consist of seven (7) members appointed to
indefinite terms who shall serve at the pleasure of the Pigeon Forge Board of
Commissioners and said membership shall include one (1) member who is an
active or retired educator, one (1) member who is a school board member, one
(1) member of the Pigeon Forge Board of Commissioners, one (1) member who
is the city manager or their designee, one (1) member of the business
community, one (1) member who is a city resident, and one (1) member who is
a city resident or a business owner within the city.
(2) Said board shall review requests from the public schools located
within the corporate limits of the City of Pigeon Forge for funding of projects to
benefit the schools from revenue generated from tax collected from the sale of
alcoholic beverages i.e. wine, liquor and mixed drinks and otherwise referred to
herein as a "mixed drink tax."
(3) Said board shall meet no less than one (1) time annually and more
often as needed at the discretion of said board.
(4) Before the educational funding board shall approve any project for
any public school within the corporate limits of the city, the respective schools
shall submit a list of desired equipment or improvements or projects to be
funded along with a cost proposal for each project. Should the board elect to
approve funding for all or any of said projects, they shall do so by a majority vote
and their recommendation shall be forwarded to the city's chief financial officer
who shall issue funds to the particular school. No project shall be voted upon for
funding approval unless the city's chief financial officer shall advise the board
that sufficient funds are available for the same from the mixed drink tax
collections and that when required, the Sevier County School System's
regulations for public bidding have been met. Should the board fail to approve
any requested school project by a majority vote, the same shall be deemed to be
rejected and the requesting school shall submit additional requests.
(5) No funds from the mixed drink tax shall be expended to any public
school within the corporate limits of the city for any school personnel salary or
for any expense that is mandated by the State of Tennessee or any federal rule
or regulation. Therefore, the expenditures of mixed drink tax revenue shall
benefit projects of the public schools within the City of Pigeon Forge over and
Change 14, August 11, 2014 2-4
above the normal funding for school operations in place by the Sevier County
School System.
(6) The board shall on an annual basis divide the revenue from the
mixed drink tax by the number of public schools within the corporate limits of
the City of Pigeon Forge and funding to any one school shall not exceed that
school's percentage of the total mixed drink tax revenue. (as added by Ord.

2-303. General powers and duties.
2-304. Appeal from a special events administrative review.
2-201. Special events and site plan regulations for special events,
festivals, and similar activity uses. It is the general purpose of and intent
of this section to require site plans for special events or activities. A special
event is a unique festival, fair, carnival or other type of promotion that is
outside the customary or usual activities associated with the daily events of the
business/property where the special event will be hosted. It is a temporary
outdoor use that extends beyond the normal business activities and is designed
to draw large crowds to promote a specific charity, cause, city-wide event, hobby
or festival. Special events that are held in conjunction with a City of Pigeon
Forge city-wide special event promoted by the department of tourism such as
Winterfest, Celebrate Freedom, or nationally known non-profit groups with a
recognized local chapter, will be allowed permits to operate for thirty (30)
consecutive days during that event, providing the applicant can show a direct
correlation in activities that promote, compliment and correspond in nature and
type with the city sponsored events. Only one (1) permit per business, group or
location may be submitted for a city-wide special event permit per calendar year.
Special events that are promoted by businesses that are not held in conjunction
with city-wide special events may be held for three (3) consecutive days per
calendar year, excluding one (1) day for the set-up and one (1) day for the
take-down of the event, with an approved site plan. No more than six (6) permits
shall be issued to a business, group, or location per calendar year. No special
event shall be located on any easements or on any rights-of-way. All special
events must be contained solely on the property of the sponsoring business.
Special event permits shall be allowed only in commercial districts. The special
event review may allow additional time based on extenuating circumstances. (as
added by Ord. #1015, May 2016)
2-202. Creation, members, terms, vacancies. There is hereby created
a special events administrative review to oversee the permitting of special
events, peddlers, vendors and similar short-term outdoor displays and events.
The special events administrative review is an in-house review in which
proposals are distributed to the following departments and agencies: police, fire,
planning, streets, utilities, solid waste, recreation, tourism and trolley. The
Change 16, June 26, 2017 2-6
review shall be conducted on an as needed basis in the review applications for
special events, peddlers, vendors. The special events applications may be
approved administratively unless staff thinks that a full planning commission
review is necessary. (as added by Ord. #1015, May 2016)
2-203. General powers and duties. The powers and duties are to
review all applications for special events, peddlers and vendors to determine the
health safety and welfare issues of each event. Off Premise Canvasser (OPCs)
requirements are not included in these sections but OPCs are required to meet
§§ 9-208 through 9-216. The review power shall include all those enumerated in
title 9, chapter 2 of the municipal code entitled peddlers, etc., § 9-205. Additional
powers include the right to deny a special event permit for fraud,
incompleteness of application, conflicts in time and location with other special
events, timing of the applicant event, location of an event, problems with past
events by the same applicant or group represented, potential damage to public
property, disapproval of site owner or property owners, potential harm to the
public, noise, potential abuse of animals, lack of sanitary facilities for waste,
after hours noise nuisance by holding the event after 12:00 A.M. and before 7:00
A.M., site incapacity to handle crowds, disruptions to adjacent businesses by
blocking of access to facilities or any other unsafe conditions. (as added by Ord.
#1015, May 2016)
2-204. Appeal from a special events administrative review. An
appeal from a special events administrative review is to the planning
commission for a full hearing. (as added by Ord. #1015, May 2016)

sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.

13 1999)(table); and based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring
in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
Austin, Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California -
1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98;
Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-2003; Los Angeles, California 1977; Whittier,
California - 1978; Spokane, Washington - 2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota 1994;
Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas -
1997; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; New York,
New York Times Square - 1994; and the Report of the Attorney General's
Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6,
1989, State of Minnesota), the city council finds:
a. Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial
uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects
including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution,
potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit
drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding
properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
b. Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from
sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon
such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented
businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses
and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented
businesses in one area.
c. Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes
a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in
preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in
preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this chapter,
exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented
and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in
regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future
secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses
that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and
documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably believed to be
relevant to said secondary effects. (as added by Ord. #795, April 2006, as
replaced by Ord. #816, Dec. 2006)

act by an employee that constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of that
employee's license shall be imputed to the sexually oriented business licensee
for purposes of finding a violation of this chapter, or for purposes of license

of the city official under this chapter, and not completed in the time prescribed,
includes approval of condition(s) necessary for approval by the city of an
applicant or licensee's application for sexually oriented business license or a
sexually oriented business employee's license (including a renewal), the license
shall be deemed granted and the business or employee allowed to commence
operations or employment the day after the deadline for the city's action has
passed. (as added by Ord. #816, Dec. 2006)

chapter be invalidated, such invalidation shall not affect the enforceability of the
substantive aspects of this chapter. (as added by Ord. #816, Dec. 2006)
9-1122. Conflicting code provisions repealed. Ordinance No. 795 is

installed, replaced, maintained, or repaired within the corporate limits shall
conform to the requirements of this chapter and to the International Fuel Gas
Code,1 2000 edition, which is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part

12-403. Use of existing piping and appliances. Notwithstanding any
provision in the gas code to the contrary, consumer's piping installed prior to the
adoption of the gas code or piping installed to supply other than natural gas may
be converted to natural gas if the inspector finds, upon inspection and proper
tests, that such piping will render reasonably satisfactory gas service to the
consumer and will not in any way endanger life or property; otherwise, such
piping shall be altered or replaced, in whole or in part, to conform with the
requirements of the gas code. (1979 Code, § 4-403)
12-404. Bond and license. (1) No person shall engage in or work at the

until the first day of January next succeeding its issuance, unless sooner
revoked. The person obtaining a license shall pay any applicable license fees to

individual from installing or repairing his own appliances or installing,
extending, replacing, altering, or repairing consumer's piping on his own
premises, or as requiring a license or a bond from an individual doing such work
on his own premises; provided, however, all such work must be done in

(2) The inspector is authorized to disconnect any gas piping or fixture
or appliance for which a certificate of approval is required but has not been
issued with respect to same, or which, upon inspection, shall be found defective
or in such condition as to endanger life or property. In all cases where such a
disconnection is made, a notice shall be attached to the piping, fixture, or
appliance disconnected by the inspector, which notice shall state that the same
has been disconnected by the inspector, together with the reason or reasons
therefor, and it shall be unlawful for any person to remove said notice or
reconnect said gas piping or fixture or appliance without authorization by the
inspector and such gas piping or fixture or appliance shall not be put in service
or used until the inspector has attached his certificate of approval in lieu of his
prior disconnection notice.
(3) It shall be the duty of the inspector to confer from time to time with
representatives of the local health department, the city fire department, and the
gas company, and otherwise obtain from proper sources all helpful information
and advice, presenting same to the appropriate officials from time to time for

will not be required for setting or connecting other gas appliances, or for the
repair of leaks in house piping.
(2) When only temporary use of gas is desired, the recorder may issue
a permit for such use, for a period of not to exceed sixty (60) days, provided the
consumer's gas piping to be used is given a test equal to that required for a final
piping inspection.
(3) Except when work in a public street or other public way is involved
the gas company shall not be required to obtain permits to set meters, or to
extend, relocate, remove, or repair its service lines, mains, or other facilities, or
for work having to do with its own gas system. (1979 Code, § 4-407)
12-21
12-408. Inspections. (1) A rough piping inspection shall be made after
all new piping authorized by the permit has been installed, and before any such
piping has been covered or concealed or any fixtures or gas appliances have been
attached thereto.
(2) A final piping inspection shall be made after all piping authorized
by the permit has been installed and after all portions thereof which are to be
concealed by plastering or otherwise have been so concealed, and before any
fixtures or gas appliances have been attached thereto. This inspection shall
include a pressure test, at which time the piping shall stand an air pressure
equal to not less than the pressure of a column of mercury six (6) inches in
height, and the piping shall hold this air pressure for a period of at least ten (10)
minutes without any perceptible drop. A mercury column gauge shall be used
for the test. All tools, apparatus, labor, and assistance necessary for the test
shall be furnished by the installer of such piping. (1979 Code, § 4-408)
12-409. Certificates. The inspector shall issue a certificate of approval
at the completion of the work for which a permit for consumer piping has been
issued if after inspection it is found that such work complies with the provisions
of the gas code. A duplicate of each certificate issued covering consumer's gas
piping shall be delivered to the gas company and used as its authority to render
gas service. (1979 Code, § 4-409)

thereof shall be fined under the general penalty clause for this code of
ordinances, or the license of such person may be revoked, or both fine and
revocation of license may be imposed. (1979 Code, § 4-411)

upon the city any liability or responsibility for damages to any person injured

section to encourage all businesses to use common signs so that there will be no
confusing clusters of signs at intersections.

placing of off premise signs, the City of Pigeon Forge may permit the location of
such signs within the right of way of a road, provided that the location of such
sign will not interfere with traffic movement and sight distances. Where
property is not available and an off-premise sign cannot be satisfactorily located
within the adjoining right of way, such sign may be located at the closest
available property to the appropriate intersection. For such signs, information
may be provided to allow for sufficient directions to each individual business
advertised on the sign.
No other information other than the name and nature of, distance to, and
trademark for, each business shall be allowed on such sign. Arrows may be used
on each sign to point the correct direction of each business.
In cases where any business, structure, location, place of enterprise, or
other such attraction, which is listed on the National Historical Register, is
desirous of locating an off-premises sun, the following guidelines and
restrictions shall apply:

or public place, or to tunnel under any street, alley, or public place without
having first obtained a permit as herein required, and without complying with
the provisions of this chapter; and it shall also be unlawful to violate, or vary
from, the terms of any such permit; provided, however, any person maintaining
pipes, lines, or other underground facilities in or under the surface of any street
may proceed with an opening without a permit when emergency circumstances
demand the work to be done immediately and a permit cannot reasonably and
practicably be obtained beforehand. The person shall thereafter apply for a
permit on the first regular business day on which the office of the city manager
is open for business, and said permit shall be retroactive to the date when the
work was begun. (1979 Code, § 12-201)
16-202. Applications. Applications for such permits shall be made to

corporation, association, or others for whom the work is being done, and shall

until the applicant therefor has deposited with the city manager a cash deposit.
The deposit shall be in the sum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) if no pavement is
involved or seventy-five dollars ($75.00) if the excavation is in a paved area and
shall insure the proper restoration of the ground and laying of the pavement, if
any. Where the amount of the deposit is clearly inadequate to cover the cost of
restoration, the city manager may increase the amount of the deposit to an
amount considered by him to be adequate to cover the cost. From this deposit
shall be deducted the expense to the city of relaying the surface of the ground
or pavement, and of making the refill if this is done by the city or at its expense.
The balance shall be returned to the applicant without interest after the tunnel
or excavation is completely refilled and the surface or pavement is restored.
In lieu of a deposit the applicant may deposit with the city manager a
surety bond in such form and amount as the city manager shall deem adequate
to cover the costs to the city if the applicant fails to make proper restoration.

16-205. Manner of excavating--barricades and lights--temporary
sidewalks. Any person, firm, corporation, association, or others making any
excavation or tunnel shall do so according to the terms and conditions of the
application and permit authorizing the work to be done. Sufficient and proper
barricades and lights shall be maintained to protect persons and property from
injury by or because of the excavation being made. If any sidewalk is blocked
by any such work, a temporary sidewalk shall be constructed and provided
which shall be safe for travel and convenient for users. (1979 Code, § 12-205)
16-206. Restoration of streets, etc. Any person, firm, corporation,
association, or others making any excavation or tunnel in or under any street,
alley, or public place in this city shall restore said street, alley, or public place
to its original condition except for the surfacing, which shall be done by the city,
but shall be paid for promptly upon completion by such person, firm,
corporation, association, or others for which the excavation or tunnel was made.
In case of unreasonable delay in restoring the street, alley, or public place, the
16-6
city manager shall give notice to the person, firm, corporation, association, or
others that unless the excavation or tunnel is refilled properly within a specified
reasonable period of time, the city will do the work and charge the expense of
doing the same to such person, firm, corporation, association, or others. If
within the specified time the conditions of the above notice have not been
complied with, the work shall be done by the city, an accurate account of the
expense involved shall be kept, and the total cost shall be charged to the person,
firm, corporation, association, or others who made the excavation or tunnel.
(1979 Code, § 12-206)
16-207. Insurance. In addition to making the deposit or giving the bond
hereinbefore required to insure that proper restoration is made, each person
applying for an excavation permit shall file a certificate of insurance indicating
that he is insured against claims for damages for personal injury as well as
against claims for property damage which may arise from or out of the
performance of the work, whether such performance be by himself, his
subcontractor, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by him. Such insurance
shall cover collapse, explosive hazards, and underground work by equipment on
the street, and shall include protection against liability arising from completed
operations. The amount of the insurance shall be prescribed by the city
manager in accordance with the nature of the risk involved; provided, however,
that the liability insurance for bodily injury shall not be less than $100,000 for
each person and $200,000 for each accident, and for property damages not less
than $50,000, with an aggregate of $100,000 for all accidents. (1979 Code,
§ 12-207)
16-208. Time limits. Each application for a permit shall state the
length of time it is estimated will elapse from the commencement of the work
until the restoration of the surface of the ground or pavement, or until the refill
is made ready for the pavement to be put on by the city if the city restores such
surface pavement. It shall be unlawful to fail to comply with this time
limitation unless permission for an extension of time is granted by the city
manager. (1979 Code, § 12-208)
16-209. Supervision. The city manager shall from time to time inspect
all excavations and tunnels being made in or under any public street, alley, or
other public place in the city and see to the enforcement of the provisions of this

refilling any such excavation or tunnel commences. (1979 Code, § 12-209)
16-210. Driveway curb cuts. No one shall cut, build, or maintain a
driveway across a curb or sidewalk without first obtaining a permit from the city
manager. Such a permit will not be issued when the contemplated driveway is

16-7
and/or vehicular traffic. No driveway shall exceed thirty-five (35) feet in width
at its outer or street edge and when two (2) or more adjoining driveways are
provided for the same property a safety island of not less than ten (10) feet in

public water supply for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems
therein for cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, by-passes, or inter-connections.
On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant of any property so served shall
furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping
Change 11, November 10, 2008 18-25
system or systems on such property. The refusal of such information or refusal
of access, when requested, shall be deemed evidence of the presence of crossconnections.
(1979 Code, § 8-506)
18-407. Correction of existing violations. Any person who now has
cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, by-passes, or inter-connections in violation
of the provisions of this chapter shall be allowed a reasonable time within which
to comply with the provisions of this chapter. After a thorough investigation of
existing conditions and an appraisal of the time required to complete the work,
the amount of time shall be designated by the superintendent of the Pigeon
Forge public water supply.
The failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public water
system as prohibited by this chapter and the Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-221-711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set by the
superintendent of the public water supply, shall be grounds for denial of water
service. If proper protection has not been provided after a reasonable time, the
utility shall give the customer legal notification that water service is to be
discontinued, and physically separate the public water supply from the
customer's on-site piping system in such a manner that the two systems cannot
again be connected by an unauthorized person.
Where cross-connections, inter-connections, auxiliary intakes, or bypasses
are found that constitute an extreme hazard of immediate concern of
contaminating the public water system, immediate steps shall be taken to
disconnect the public water supply from the on-site piping system unless the
imminent hazard is corrected immediately. (1979 Code, § 8-507)
18-408. Use of protective devices. Where the nature of use of the
water supplied a premises by the water department is such that it is deemed:
(1) Impractical to provide an effective air-gap separation.
(2) That the owner and/or occupant of the premises cannot or is not
willing to demonstrate to the official in charge of the system, or his designated
representative, that the water use and protective features of the plumbing are
such as to propose no threat to the safety or potability of the water supply.
(3) That the nature and mode of operation within a premises are such
that frequent alterations are made to the plumbing.
(4) There is a likelihood that protective measures may be subverted,
altered, or disconnected, the superintendent of the Pigeon Forge Public water
supply, or his designated representative, shall require the use of an approved
protective device on the service line serving the premises to assure that any
contamination that may originate in the customer's premises is contained
therein. The protective devices shall be a reduced pressure zone type backflow
preventer approved by the Tennessee Department of Health as to manufacture,
model, and size. The method of installation of backflow protective devices shall
be approved by the superintendent of the public water supply prior to
Change 11, November 10, 2008 18-26
installation and shall comply with the criteria set forth by the Tennessee
Department of Health. The installation shall be at the expense of the owner or
occupant of the premises.
Personnel of the Pigeon Forge public water supply shall have the right to
inspect and test the device or devices on an annual basis or whenever deemed
necessary by the superintendent or his designated representative. Water
service shall not be disrupted to test the device without the knowledge of the
occupant of the premises.
Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal operations
or protection of life, property, or equipment, duplicate units shall be provided to
avoid the necessity of discontinuing water service to test or repair the protective
device or devices. Where it is found that only one unit has been installed and
the continuance of service is critical, the superintendent shall notify, in writing,
the occupant of the premises of plans to discontinue water service and arrange
for a mutually acceptable time to test and/or repair the device. The water
supply shall require the occupant of the premises to make all repairs indicated
promptly, to keep the unit(s) working properly, and the expense of such repairs
shall be borne by the owner or occupant of the premises. Repairs shall be made
by qualified personnel acceptable to the superintendent of the Pigeon Forge
public water supply.
If necessary, water service shall be discontinued (following legal
notification) for failure to maintain backflow prevention devices in proper
working order. Likewise, the removal, bypassing, or altering of the protective
device(s) or the installation thereof so as to render the device(s) ineffective shall
constitute grounds for discontinuance of water service. Water service to such
premises shall not be restored until the customer has corrected or eliminated
such conditions or defects to the satisfaction of the superintendent of the Pigeon
Forge public water supply. (1979 Code, § 8-508)
18-409. Unpotable water to be labeled. The potable water supply
made available to premises served by the public water supply shall be protected
from possible contamination as specified herein. Any water outlet which could
be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not supplied by the
potable system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as:
WATER UNSAFE
FOR DRINKING
The minimum acceptable sign shall have black letters at least one-inch high
located on a red background. (1979 Code, § 8-509)
18-410. Violations. The requirements contained herein shall apply to
all premises served by the Pigeon Forge water system whether located inside or
Change 11, November 10, 2008 18-27
outside the corporate limits and are hereby made a part of the conditions
required to be met for the city to provide water services to any premises. Such
action, being essential for the protection of the water distribution system
against the entrance of contamination which may render the water unsafe
healthwise, or otherwise undesirable, shall be enforced rigidly without regard
to location of the premises, whether inside or outside the Pigeon Forge corporate
limits.
Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions
of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. (1979 Code, § 8-510)

tampering with meters, etc.; interfering with installation,
operation, etc., of meter.
18-505. Penalty.
18-506. Fees - repurified water.
18-501. Definitions. (1) Defintions. (a) "Customer" shall mean the
person or legal entity who owns property to which repurified water
service is to be, or is being, provided. Because of the variety of
infrastructure and use issues arising with repurified water, the owner of
the property is required to complete the application and agreement for
service. If a person other than the owner is to be billed for the monthly
service charge and the repurified water usage, both the owner and the
other person must complete the application and agreement. The owner
and the other person will collectively be the customer and both will be
required to follow the terms and conditions of this ordinance and the
agreement.
(b) "Pigeon Forge" shall mean the City of Pigeon Forge,
Tennessee.
(c) "Repurified water" shall mean the highly treated reclaimed
water produced at the City of Pigeon Forge Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The product has been subjected to physical and biochemical processes,
and has been filtered and disinfected with both ultraviolet light and
chlorine prior to being introduced into a dedicated distribution system.
While not intended for human or animal consumption, this water is
suitable for a number of domestic, commercial and industrial
applications, as established by the city.
(2) Use of repurified water regulated. All persons using repurified
water produced by the city shall comply with all relevant provisions of city
ordinances and Pigeon Forge policies and standards relating to potable water,
repurified water and sewerage systems of the city.
(3) Use of repurified water. Repurified water shall be utilized for
irrigation and may be utilized for other approved uses as established by policies
adopted by Pigeon Forge.
Change 16, June 26, 2017 18-29
(4) Infrastructure. All lines and appurtenances dedicated to public use
shall be located in public right-of ways or easements approved by the city. Such
lines and appurtenances and easements shall become the property of the Pigeon
Forge, and shall be maintained by Pigeon Forge. The construction of all
repurified water lines shall be in accordance with the requirements and policies
of the city.
(5) The city council, after receiving a recommendation from the public
works department, shall by ordinance establish and from time to time adjust
rates, fees, charges and credits for the repurified water system.
(6) The board shall adopt policies and regulations for the repurified
water system and the use of repurified water. (as added by Ord. #1024, Oct.
2016)
18-502. Conditions for repurified water service. (1) Compliance with
regulations. Repurified water is subject to a variety of federal, state and local
regulations to protect the safety of the public and the integrity of both the
potable and repurified water systems. Customer agrees to comply with any
federal, state and local laws, regulations and standards that may apply the
customer's use of repurified water. Such laws, regulations and standards may
include:
(a) Requirements and restrictions governing the use of
repurified water;
(b) Application methods that reasonably preclude certain kinds
of human contact with repurified water;
(c) Controlled access to the repurified water, its delivery
system, storage and use;
(d) Requirements to prevent repurified water from standing on
open access areas during normal periods of use;
(5) Requirements to prevent repurified water from coming into
contact with drinking fountains, water coolers or eating areas; and,
(6) Requirements to identify certain components of the delivery
system, or to provide public notice or signage that repurified water is
used on the customer's premises.
(2) Compliance with agreement. A repurified water customer
agreement establishes the terms and conditions that apply to the ultimate
consumer of the city's repurified water. No repurified water service of the city
may be connected or served until the following conditions are met:
(a) A complete agreement and application for repurified water
is executed by the owner of the property and, if different from the owner,
the user;
(b) Pigeon Forge and the customer agree on the use site; Pigeon
Forge agrees to deliver repurified water to a meter at the customer's
property line at the designated use site and the customer agrees that
Change 16, June 26, 2017 18-30
repurified water will be stored and/or used exclusively at the designated
use site;
(c) Customer may not resell repurified water, and is prohibited
from conveying repurified water delivered under this agreement to any
other premises or location not specified in the application;
(d) The Pigeon Forge repurified water distribution system
terminates at the meter. The Customer is solely responsible for any on
site costs arising from the construction, maintenance or operation of the
onsite portion of the system; and,
(3) Color coding. The use of color code Pantone Purple 522C is required
for all public repurified water lines, valves and outlets and appurtenances, and
is strongly recommended for distribution and application facilities located on
private properties.
(4) Hose bibs. Customer specifically agrees not to install hose bibs,
except as allowed by city policy, on any component of the repurified water
delivery system.
(5) Signage. Customer is responsible for posting and maintaining signs
that will info1m the public that repurified water is being used on the customer's
premises. Such signage shall conform to the policies of the city. Customer may
also be responsible for posting other signage that may be required by the State
of Tennessee.
(6) Cross-connection control. Repurified water is designated as a
nonpotable water supply. Since it is virtually impossible to distinguish
repurified water from drinking water by sight or scent, it is important
to maintain complete separation of the repurified water and potable water
systems. To accomplish this goal, the provisions of the cross-connection control
program shall apply. At a minimum, a reduced pressure backflow prevention
device shall be required on the potable water supply for the site served with
repurified water.
(7) Inspection. Customer agrees that the city or any other public
agency with the authority to verify compliance with the repurified water use
regulation may inspect the customer's premises to verify compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. Customer further acknowledges the
responsibility and obligation to inform Pigeon Forge of certain activities relating
to the construction, maintenance and operation of its private repurified water
system, including, but not necessarily limited to, materials, construction or
modification, testing, violations and emergency situations.
(8) Plans. Customer acknowledges the responsibility to maintain a
copy of the on site repurified water system plans at the premises where the
water is being used.
(9) Potential disruption of service. Customer accepts the possibility
that Pigeon Forge may be required to disrupt repurified water service or to
reduce pressure due to emergency conditions, peak demands, or planned system
Change 16, June 26, 2017 18-31
maintenance. Pigeon Forge will not be responsible for any damage or loss that
may be sustained because of any interruption of service.
(10) Emergency terminations. When there is an unforeseen emergency,
Pigeon Forge may terminate delivery of repurified water without notice. When
notice of an emergency is given, customer shall reduce or cease usage of
repurified water.
(11) Cessation or reduction in use. In order to accommodate peak
demands or planned maintenance, Pigeon Forge shall provide the customer with
twenty-four hour notice of the need to cease or reduce repurified water usage.
Upon receipt of such notice, customer shall comply with the notice.
(12) Transfer of property. Customer agrees that all leases of the
premisessubject to the agreement for repurified water service shall be in writing
and must be made expressly subject to the agreement. Should the customer sell
or otherwise transfer ownership or control of the premises described herein to
a third party, Pigeon Forge shall not be obligated to provide repurified water to
any subsequent owner or customer unless such sale or disposal incorporates the
agreement by reference, and makes any successors and assigns expressly subject
to the agreement. If such third party disposition does not include such
provisions, customer will close its account with Pigeon Forge and pay any fees
or charges incurred by customer before the disposition of the property is
effective.
(13) Termination of service. Customer acknowledges that potable water,
repurified water and sewer service may be discontinued for failure to comply
with the terms and conditions of the agreement for repurified water service,
including, but not limited to, failure to pay for potable water, repurified water
or sewer services provided by Pigeon Forge. (as added by Ord. #1024, Oct. 2016)
18-503. Discontinuance of service for failure to pay bill. If any
person shall fail to pay their bill for potable water, repurified water or sewer
service by the due date shown on such bill, Pigeon Forge may cut off and
disconnect repurified water from the premises of the person owning or
controlling the property to which such bill relates, and water shall remain cut
off and disconnected from such premises until bill shall be paid.
If the water shall be so cut off or disconnected, the same rules that apply
for disconnection and reconnection of potable water shall apply.
If any check is returned by any bank for any reason, there shall be a
service charge as set forth in Title 18. If service is discontinued due to failure by
the customer to make satisfactory restitution for said check, the reconnection
fee described in the preceding paragraph shall apply.
Pigeon Forge shall not be liable for any damages resulting from
discontinuance of service for failure to pay bill, or from delay in reconnection of
service. (as added by Ord. #1024, Oct. 2016)
Change 16, June 26, 2017 18-32
18-504. Tapping mains without permission; using unmetered
water; tampering with meters, etc.; interfering with installation,
operation, etc., of meter. It shall be unlawful for any person:
(1) To make a tap or connection with any repurified water main of the
city or with any pipe connected with any such repurified water main, without
first obtaining the consent of Pigeon Forge;
(2) To take, use or consume any repurified water from any such water
main or any pipe connected with any such repurified water main, unless such
repurified water is regularly metered by a water meter installed, or the
installation of which has been approved, by Pigeon Forge;
(3) To tamper in any manner with any such meter, including all
fittings and fixtures thereon and connection thereto, or in any respect with the
regularly approved installation of same; or,
(4) By the installation or use of any pipe, by-pass, cut-off or other
device or by other means whatsoever, to interfere in any manner with the
approved installation of any such meter or with the normal operation of any
such meter or with the normal registration thereon and thereby of the quantity
of water consumed. (as added by Ord. #1024, Oct. 2016)
18-505. Penalty. Any person who shall violate or fail to comply with any
provision of this chapter shall be penalized as provided herein and by any other
applicable regulation and/or law.
In addition, whenever it has been determined that an illegal connection
has been made, Pigeon Forge shall charge the owner of the property any costs
associated with removing the connection. (as added by Ord. #1024, Oct. 2016)
18-506. Fees - repurified water. (1) Schedule of repurified water
rates.
(a) Rates established. The schedules of repurified water service
fees and usage rates to be charged and collected by the city from

25
407. Planned Unit Development. The following regulations for planned unit developments shall be submitted to the planning commission for approval and shall comply with the regulations established in this section.
407.1. Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (sometimes hereinafter referred to as PUD) is to provide diversification in the relationship of uses and structures to their sites and also provide flexibility which will create a more desirable living environment. A PUD shall mean an integrated, professionally prepared design for development of residential, commercial, or industrial uses or as permitted combinations of such uses to allow application of new techniques and technology of site and building design and location, thus achieving economies in land usage, maintenance, and street and utility systems while providing for attractive open areas, safe circulations and general well-being of the inhabitants.
407.2. Concept. A PUD may be developed in any district provided that the uses permitted and density requirements of the district allow the development and the PUD plan elements are approved by the planning commission. Residential, commercial, or industrial uses, or combinations of these uses where district or special regulations permit, may be developed under the PUD concept. Cluster type subdivisions and condominiums, townhouses, multi-dwelling unit, rental developments, multi-use commercial uses, industrial uses, mobile home parks, travel trailer parks and multi-use or ownership developments shall be considered as PUDs for the purpose of this ordinance.
407.3. General Requirements. All PUD developments shall comply with the following requirements:
407.3.1. Minimum site: No PUD shall have an area less than that required by the planning commission as adequate for the proposed project; however, the minimum site shall not be less than the minimum lot size required in the district in which the proposed project is to be located. A minimum lot size PUD may be allowed to vary setback requirements as established in 407.3.2.2. upon approval of the planning commission. However, in no case shall the minimum setbacks be less than those required in the zoning district, and in no case shall the setback be less than twenty-five (25) feet in areas that adjoin a residential district.
(Amended by Ord. 911, Adopted 7/2010)
407.3.2. Structures and spaces: The planning commission shall require arrangement of structures and open spaces within each site as necessary to assure that adjacent uses will not be adversely affected.
407.3.2.1. Where feasible the highest height and intensity of uses shall be toward the interior of the project.
26
407.3.2.2. Except as provided in 407.3.1. a freestanding building shall be no closer than twenty (20) feet to any other freestanding building and no closer than twenty-five (25) feet to exterior boundary property lines.
407.3.3. Open Space Requirements. Preservation, maintenance, and ownership of open space areas and facilities shall be established in the appropriate legal manner.
407.3.1.1. Dedication to the public as part of parks and open space system;
407.3.3.2. By the homeowners association;
407.3.3.3. By the developer or management authority of the PUD.
407.3.4. Off-street Parking Requirements:
Single-family (including cabins, chalets, etc.), townhouse and duplex – Two (2) spaces per dwelling unit, up to three (3) bedrooms per unit, with an additional one-half (½) space for each additional bedroom beyond three (3).
Multi-family units (including apartments, “condominiums,” time-share units, etc.) # of Bedrooms # of Required Parking Spaces Maximum Size of Units*

2.0
1,600 sq. ft
4+
An additional one half space for each bedroom over three
An additional 300 sq. ft. for each bed room over three
*The Planning Commission will review whether the number of parking spaces is adequate for units that exceed the maximum size for the number of bedrooms provided. Additional spaces may be required if the Planning Commission determines that the larger units may house more guests than would be normal for a unit with a certain number of bedrooms.
Parking Reduction Factor for Large-Scale Multi-Family Developments:
As the size of a multi-family PUD project increases, the likelihood that all units will be occupied at the maximum intensity at any given
27
time decreases. Therefore, a parking reduction factor can be applied to projects meeting the following size standards:
? Projects having between 100 units and 199 units may reduce required parking by five (5%) percent.
? Projects having between 200 units and 299 units may reduce required parking by ten (10%) percent.
? Projects having 300 or more units may reduce required parking by fifteen (15%) percent.
All other permitted uses as required in Section 402. (Ord. 788, adopted 2/13/06)
407.3.5. Height and Density. No PUD shall exceed general regulations for the district in which it is to be located, except that residential PUDs in R-2 Residential Districts may be allowed to exceed height limits but not to exceed forty-eight (48) feet when the following conditions are met and all conditions approved by the planning commission in the approval process.
407.3.5.l. Fire hydrants are installed so that any part of all buildings can be reached with a hose length of two hundred fifty (250) feet;
407.3.5.2. The project includes tennis courts, swimming pool, equipped play area, clubhouse, or other similar recreation facilities.
407.3.5.3. For every foot over thirty-five (35) feet in height, the structure or structures shall be set back one (1) additional foot from all property and building lines.
407.3.6. Signage. Each residential PUD shall be limited to one (1) major sign and any number of small accessory signs for information purposes. These signs shall be traffic directional signs or face signs attached to the wall of a building or located within the yard area. Commercial and industrial PUDs shall meet general signage requirements established in Section 408.
407.3.7. Subdivision Regulations. A PUD plan has a direct relationship with subdivision regulations. Therefore, arrangement of public and common ways for pedestrian and vehicular circulation shall be in relationship with other existing or planned streets and ways and with the Pigeon Forge Major Road Plan. Project street and way improvements shall comply with the standards set forth in the subdivision regulations. However, the uniqueness of each proposed PUD may require slight variances from widths of streets, ways, utility easements, curbing, and similar standards on the subdivision regulations. Upon application by the owner/developer and good cause shown, the planning commission may
28
permit changes or alterations of these standards, provided they are consistent with the spirit and intent of this section. These modifications may only be approved as a variance on the approval of the preliminary subdivision plat which is concurrent with final approval of the PUD plan.
407.3.8. Density. Structures designated for schools, churches, and other similar public uses shall not be used in any density requirements. However, the open space around these structures may be so computed.
407.4. Plan Requirements. The PUD plan approval process shall generally require four (4) steps which shall be the submission and approval of a preliminary PUD plan, the submission and approval of a final PUD plan and a preliminary subdivision plat, and the submission and approval of a final subdivision plat.
407.4.1. The preliminary PUD plan shall be a concept or sketch plan which shall show the general location of buildings and uses, general circulation patterns, open space and recreation areas, parking areas, ingress/egress points, sketch elevations and drainage, the boundary dimensions, overall density of development, public uses, landscaping concepts, zoning classification, and other information deemed pertinent by the planning commission.
407.4.2. The final PUD plan shall include detailed architectural/ engineering plans for: utilities, vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems, location of all structures, topographic, minimum elevations, and grading, the physical relationship of uses, parking areas, open space and recreation areas, landscape areas, buffer or screening materials and locations, areas proposed for dedication as parks, ways, or places, final drafts of legal documents, and other information deemed pertinent by the planning commission.
407.4.3. The preliminary subdivision plat shall meet all requirements for preliminary approval as noted in the Pigeon Forge Subdivision Regulations.
407.5. Staging of Development. The PUD applicant may elect to develop the site in successive stages. The stages and expected development periods shall be shown on the PUD development plans. However, each stage approved must be substantially complete within its segment. The planning commission may also require the development of a PUD project in stages if public facilities are not adequate to handle the entire development initially.
407.6. Changes and Modifications. A PUD project may be changed or modified under conditions established for minor changes and major changes.
29
407.6.1. Minor changes: The planning commission may approve changes in minor shifts of building locations proposed streets and ways, utilities and easements, recreation and open space areas or other features on the approved plan. However, these changes shall not increase densities, change exterior boundary lines, change uses, materially change location or amount of land devoted to specific uses, or significantly change the exterior features or appearance of buildings and uses shown on the approved plans.
407.6.2. Major changes: All changes other than those established as minor shall be considered as major changes to the PUD plan and shall require a new plan submission in accordance with the procedures and requirements for approval of a PUD plan.
407.7. Permits. The developer of the PUD shall be entitled to receive a special conditions permit after approval of the final PUD plan and the preliminary subdivision plat.
407.7.1. Building, grading permits: These permits shall be issued after the special conditions permit is obtained. The building official however, shall revoke any permit issued in reliance on said plan at such time as it becomes obvious that the project is not in compliance with the plan.
407.7.2. Certificate of Occupancy: A certificate of occupancy permit shall not be issued until all conditions of the final PUD plan, final subdivision plat, and building codes are met.
407.7.3. Time limitations: any special conditions permit shall expire twelve (12) months from and after issuance if the development as approved is not in compliance with the PUD plan. However, the permit may be extended for an additional period not to exceed one (1) year for good cause shown.
408. Signs.
408.1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish reasonable and impartial regulations for location of signs within the zoning districts of Pigeon Forge so as to alleviate a growth of sign usage that is detrimental to the city. It is important that the city recognize that it is designated as a Premier Resort City of Tennessee and that obtaining and maintaining an attractive appearance protects the city's prime interest - tourism. To achieve and maintain an attractive appearance and bring about adequate light, air, and open space and reduce congestion and hazardous conditions in the city, flexible and diversified standards have been established. Therefore, all signs erected, replaced, constructed, expanded, or relocated on any property within the city shall conform to the regulations established in this section.

? The planning commission may, as a part of the site plan review, approve a ground sign with less than nine (9) feet of clearance if it does not impede pedestrian movement and it does not block sight distance of 200 feet, as noted above.
The planning commission retains the right to deny approval for safety reasons.
Monument signs shall be included in all signage allowances and the square foot calculations shall include the sign face measured from the height times the width. Planter boxes and landscaping areas around the monument sign shall not be counted in the signage allotments unless there is a business name, advertisement, or logo on the planter boxes or enclosed planting areas.

Section B. Findings of Fact
1. The City of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Mayor and Board of Commissioners wishes to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and in order to do so must meet the NFIP regulations found in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Ch. 1, Section 60.3.
2. Areas of the City of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
3. Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Section C. Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This Ordinance is designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
95
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
Section D. Objectives
The objectives of this Ordinance are:
1. To protect human life, health, safety and property;
2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodprone areas;
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas to minimize blight in flood areas;

A Tennessee registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the Administrator as set forth in Article IV, Section B.
3. Enclosures
All new construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding, shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
a. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a Tennessee professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria.
1) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;

1) In AE Zones, with Base Flood Elevations, the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated on a permanent foundation to no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the Base Flood Elevation or
2) In approximate A Zones, without Base Flood Elevations, the manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength) that are at least three (3) feet in height above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in Article II).
c. Any manufactured home, which has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood, must meet the standards of Article V, Sections A and B.
d. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
e. All recreational vehicles placed in an identified Special Flood Hazard Area must either:
1) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
2) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or;
3) The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction.
5. Standards for Subdivisions and Other Proposed New Development Proposals
Subdivisions and other proposed new developments, including manufactured home parks, shall be reviewed to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding.

d. In all approximate A Zones require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals Base Flood Elevation data (See Article V, Section E).
Section C. Standards for Special Flood Hazard Areas with Established Base Flood Elevations and With Floodways Designated
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or new development shall not result in any increase in the water surface elevation of the Base Flood Elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A Tennessee registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data, using the same methodologies as in the effective Flood Insurance Study for the City of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee and certification, thereof.
2. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V, Sections A and B.
Section D. Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard Zones AE with Established Base Flood Elevations but Without Floodways Designated
112
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
1. No encroachments, including fill material, new construction and substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
2. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V, Sections A and B.
Section E. Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations and Floodways (A Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided and where a Floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
1. The Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any Base Flood Elevation and floodway data available from any Federal, State, or other sources, including data developed as a result of these regulations (see 2 below), as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in approximate A Zones meet the requirements of Article V, Sections A and B.
2. Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals Base Flood Elevation data.
3. Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been established and where such data is not available from other sources, require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in Article II). All applicable data including elevations or floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in Article IV, Section B. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Article V, Section B.
4. Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been established and where such data is not available from other sources, no encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the
113
stream or twenty feet (20), whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
5. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V, Sections A and B. Within approximate A Zones, require that those subsections of Article V Section B dealing with the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, assuring watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and manufactured homes provisions are complied with as required.
Section F. Standards For Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition to those set forth in Article V, Sections A and B, apply:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one (1) foot above as many feet as the depth number specified on the FIRM’s, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article V, Section B.
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at least one (1) foot above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be floodproofed to at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
114
for meeting the provisions of this Ordinance and shall provide such certification to the Administrator as set forth above and as required in accordance with Article IV, Section B.
3. Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
Section G. Standards For Areas Protected by Flood Protection System (A-99 Zones
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Article III, Section B, are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but where Base Flood Elevations have not been determined. Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of Article IV and Article V shall apply.
Section H. Standards for Unmapped Streams
Located within the City of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams, the following provisions shall apply:
1. No encroachments including fill material or other development including structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the locality.
2. When a new flood hazard risk zone, and Base Flood Elevation and floodway data is available, new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the standards established in accordance with Articles IV and V.

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
OF THE
PIGEON FORGE REGIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION
ARTICLE I. PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION
A. Purpose
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once land has been cut up into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects. It is therefore to the interest of the public, the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards.
The following subdivision regulations guiding the planning commission are designed to provide for the harmonious development of the planned region; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic and also to secure adequate provisions for light, air, recreation, transportation, water, drainage, sewer and other sanitary facilities.
B. Authority
These subdivision regulations are adopted under authority granted by Sections 13-4-01 through 13-4-309 and Sections 13-3-401 through 13-3-411, Tennessee Code Annotated. The planning commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in these statutes as prerequisite to the adoption of such regulations. A certified copy of the Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Major Street and Road Plan has been filed in the Office of the Registrar of Sevier County, Tennessee, on ______________.
C. Jurisdiction
These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the corporate limits of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, as now or hereafter established and within the Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Planning Region as established by resolution of the Local Government Planning Advisory Committee. Within these regulations the term "subdivision" shall mean the division of a tract or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots, sites or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development, and includes re-subdivision and, when appropriate to the
6
context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided, provided, however, that "subdivision" does not include a division of any tract or parcel of land into two (2) or more tracts or parcels when such parts or parcels are five (5) acres or larger in size. The term "road" shall mean, relate to and include roads, streets, highways, avenues, boulevards, parkways, lanes or other ways or any part thereof. The term "plat" shall means plat, plan, plot or re-plot. The term "planning commission" shall mean any regional planning commission established by the state planning office as provided by law, and includes any municipal planning commission designated by the state planning office as the regional planning commission of a planning region composed of the territory of a single municipal together with the territory adjoining but outside of such municipality. Any prospective developer owning land located within the Pigeon Forge Planning Region shall submit his/her subdivision plat to the Pigeon Forge Planning Commission. The plat is to be submitted according to the procedures outlined in Article II, which plat shall conform to the minimum requirements set forth in Article III. Improvements shall be installed as required by Article IV of these regulations.
ARTICLE II. PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of two separate steps. The initial step is the preparation and submission of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision to the planning commission. The second step is the preparation and submission to the planning commission of a final plat together with required certificates. The final plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the county registrar when duly signed by the secretary of the planning commission.
A. General
1. Any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction of the planning commission wishing to divide such land into two or more lots, sites, or divisions, for the purpose, either immediate or future, of sale or building development, or wishing to re-subdivide for this purpose, shall submit a plan of such proposed subdivision to the planning commission for approval and shall obtain such approval prior to the filing of his subdivision plat for record. Any such plat of subdivision shall conform to the minimum standards of design for the subdivision of land as set forth in Article III of these regulations and shall be presented in the manner specified in the following section of this Article. No plat of a subdivision of land within these areas of jurisdiction shall be filed by the county registrar without the approval of the planning commission.
2. The developer should consult early and informally with the planning commission and its technical staff for advice and assistance before the preparation of the preliminary plat and its formal application for approval. This will enable him to become thoroughly familiar with these regulations, the Major Street and Road Plan and other official plans or public improvements
7
which might affect the area. Such informal review should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions.
3. A developer may omit the submission of a preliminary plat, submitting only a final plat if the following conditions are met:
a. All public improvements as set forth in Article IV are already installed. Any construction, installation, or improvements of any public improvements shall require the submission of a preliminary plat as prescribed by Section B of Article II.
b. The plat contains no more than ten lots, tracts or sites.
4. All subdivision plats and the traverse on which they are based shall meet the requirements established in the "Standards of Practice" adopted by the Tennessee Board of Examiners for Land Surveyors.
A. Preliminary Plat
1. At least twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered, the developer shall submit to the public works office, City of Pigeon Forge four (4) copies of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision in order to allow the planning commission technical staff time to review and prepare recommendations. . The plat shall contain the following information. The subdivision plat shall be drawn to a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet. At the time of such submission, the secretary or a designated representative shall issue a receipt acknowledging said submission. Neither the submission of the preliminary sketches plat to the secretary or the receipt issued by the secretary shall constitute submission of the preliminary sketch plat for consideration by the planning commission.
2. The sketch plat which shall meet the minimum standards of design as set forth in Article III and the general requirements for the construction of public improvements as set forth in Article IV shall give the following information insofar as possible.
a. The proposed subdivision name and location, the name and address of the owner or owners, and the name of the designer of the plat who shall be a licensed or certified engineer or surveyor approved by the planning commission.
b. Date, approximate north point, and graphic scale.
c. The location of existing and platted property lines, streets, buildings, water courses, railroads, sewers, bridges, culverts, drain pipes, water
8
mains, and any public utility easements, the present zoning classification, if any, both on the land to be subdivided and on the adjoining land; and the names of adjoining property owners or subdividers.
d. A construction plan which shall include: (1) a complete drainage plan showing all improvements including all proposed streets, easements, storm sewers, swales, ditches, reserved areas and lot drainage; (2) a plan and profile of all streets showing typical cross sections of proposed roadways, swales and ditches as well as both existing and proposed finished grades of paved rights-of-way and special ditches, and details of all structures which are part of the physical improvements in the subdivision. All proposed drainage structures including manholes, catch basins, junction boxes, pipe storm drains, ditches, and other drainage facilities including headwalls shall be shown on the plan and profile.
e. A location map showing relation of subdivision to well-known highways, railroads, and water courses in all directions to a distance of at least one-half (1/2) mile. Suggested scale: one (1) inch equals two thousand (2,000) feet.
f. Plans of proposed utility layouts showing feasible connections to the existing or any proposed utility systems. When such connections are not practicable, any proposed individual water supply and/or sewage disposal system must be approved by the county health department.
g. The names, locations, widths, and other dimensions of proposed streets, alleys, easements, parks, and other open spaces, reservations, lot lines, building lines and utilities.
h. Contours at vertical intervals of not more than five (5) feet except when specifically not required by the planning commission.
i. The acreage of the land to be subdivided.
j. Surveyor's seal and certification as to the class of survey and the ratio of precision of the unadjusted survey (up to l:7,500).
9
10
3. Within sixty (60) days after submission of a preliminary sketch plat, located in the planning region or within thirty (30) days if located in the municipality, the planning commission will review it and indicate its approval, disapproval, or approval subject to modifications as a basis for the preparation of the final plat. If a plat is disapproved, reasons for such disapproval will be stated in writing. If approved subject to modifications, the nature of the required modifications will be indicated.
4. The approval of the preliminary plat by the planning commission will not constitute acceptance of the final plat.
5. Failure of the planning commission to act on the preliminary sketch plat within the specified time frame as noted in B-3 after being presented at a planning commission meeting in accordance with subsections B-1 and B-2 of this Article will be deemed approval of this preliminary plat, provided however, that the applicant may waive this requirement and consent to the extension of such period.
6. One (1) copy of the sketch plat will be returned to the subdivider with any notations at the time of approval or disapproval and the specific changes, if any, required.
7. The approval of the preliminary sketch plat shall lapse unless a final plat based thereon is submitted within one (1) year from the date of such approval unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the planning commission.
8. If the subdivision is going to be developed and submitted as final plats in portions of the preliminary plat, the portions must be designated and titled in alphabetical characters.
9. No new subdivision shall use the name of an existing subdivision except one being developed in stages.

10. When a subdivision is to be developed by making changes to the land contour by grading, filling, excavating, removal of destruction of topsoil, trees or vegetative covering thereon, the developer shall prepare a site plan for erosion and sedimentation control.
a. For all proposed subdivisions, erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be presented to the planning commission and shall meet the following standards:
i. Topography - The development plan should be fitted to the topography and the soils in order to minimize erosion potential.
ii. Development Coordination - Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be coordinated with the required control measures installed prior to the start of construction.
iii. Sequential Control Measures - Land shall be developed in increments of workable size, on which, adequate controls of erosion and sedimentation can be provided and maintained during the construction period. Operations shall be staged so that the area being developed is not being exposed for a long period of time without stabilization and so that the initially disturbed areas are completely controlled before the next section is opened. The developer shall be required to schedule sequentially phased controls of erosion and sedimentation as coordinated with the development and construction stages, and shall specify in detail precisely which areas will be cleared first, and how long these areas will be exposed to the elements. The maximum exposure period shall not exceed 120 days.
iv. Runoff controls - Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during the ensuing development. Runoff must be intercepted and safely conveyed to storm drains or natural outlets where it will not erode or flood land. The drainage system for the development shall be completed and made operational as quickly as possible during construction.
v. Cover Wherever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained and protected. Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used where necessary to protect exposed areas during development.
vi. Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps) - Sediment basins shall be installed and maintained to collect sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing
13
development. Storm sewer inlets with debris guards and micro silt basins shall be provided to trap sediment and avoid possible damage by blockage.
vii. Final vegetation and structures - The permanent vegetation and structures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development.
viii. Paved areas - Streets, parking lots, and other areas shall be paved as quickly as practical.
C. Final Plat
1. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary sketch plat as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary sketch plat which he proposed to record and develop at the time, provided, however, that such portions conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
2. The final plat shall be submitted to the planning commission at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The subdivider shall submit four (4) copies of the drawings (blue line prints), together with street profiles or other plans that may be required (see Illustration 2).
3. The final plat shall be presented to the planning commission at its next meeting by the developer or designated representative for consideration for approval or disapproval.
4. The plat shall be drawn to a scale of one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet on sheets no larger than twenty four (24) by thirty (30) inches or of an approved size to correspond to local plat book dimensions. When more than one (1) sheet is required, an index sheet of the same size shall be filed showing the entire subdivision with the sheets lettered in alphabetical order as a key.
5. When the final plat has been approved by the planning commission one (1) copy will be returned to the subdivider, with the approval of the planning commission certified thereon, for filing with the county registrar as the official plat of record.

ARTICLE III. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN
A. Streets
1. Conformity to the Major Thoroughfare Plan
The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official Major Thoroughfare Plan which includes the Major Street Plan within the municipality and the Major Road Plan within the remainder of the planning region.
2. Relation to Adjoining Street System
The proposed street system shall extend existing streets or projects at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width.
3. Access Streets to Subdivision Boundaries
Sufficient access streets to adjoining properties shall be provided in subdivision to permit harmonious development of the area.
4. Street Widths
18
The minimum width of right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as shown on the Major Thoroughfare Plan and shall be not less than as follows:
a. Arterial Streets and Highways 80-150 feet, as may be required. Arterial streets and highways are those to be used primarily for fast or heavy traffic and will be located n the Major Thoroughfare Plan.
b. Collector Streets 50-60 feet Collector streets are those which carry traffic from minor streets to the major system of arterial streets and highways and include the principal entrance streets or a residential development and streets for major circulation within such a development.
c. Minor Residential Streets 50 feet Minor residential streets are those which are used primarily for access to the abutting residential properties and designed to discourage use by through traffic.
d. Marginal Access Streets 40 feet Marginal access streets are minor streets which are parallel to and adjacent to arterial streets and highways, and which provide access to abutting properties and protection from through traffic.
e. Dead-end Streets (cul-de-sac) 40 feet Cul-de-sacs are permanent dead-end streets or courts designed so that they cannot be extended in the future.
In many cases where topography or other physical conditions make a street of the required minimum width impracticable, the planning commission may modify the above requirements.
f. Loop Streets 40 feet Loop streets are streets open at both ends and connected to only one residential street with a maximum length twelve hundred (1,200) feet or twenty-five (25) dwelling units.
g. Rural Streets 50 feet Rural streets are those where development density is not more than one dwelling unit per acre and where minimum street frontage is one hundred fifty (150) feet per lot.
h. Alleys 20 feet Alleys are minor public ways used primarily for service access to the
19
back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street.
5. Additional Width on Existing Streets
Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above minimum street width requirements.
a. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
b. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half (1/2) of the required right-of-way, measures from the center line of the existing roadway, shall be provided. In no case shall the resulting right-of-way width be less than forty (40) feet.
6. Restriction of Access
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the planning commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained, in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties to afford separation of through and local traffic.
7. Street Grades
Grades on major streets shall not exceed 7 percent. Grades on other streets may exceed 7 percent but shall not exceed 15 percent.
8. Horizontal Curves
Where a deflection angle of ten (10) degrees or more in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On streets sixty (60) feet or more in width, the center line radius of curvature shall not be less than three hundred (300) feet; on other streets, not less than one hundred (100) feet; except that on minor, low-speed streets in mountainous terrain in the unincorporated portions of the planning region, horizontal curves may be reduced to not less than fifty (50) feet if the planning commission deems such design to be compatible with public safety concerns and efficient road layout. (Amended by PC action on 8/2001)
20
21
22
9. Vertical Curves
All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum length in feet equal to fifteen (15) times the algebraic difference in rates of grade for major streets and one half this minimum length for other streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals one hundred (100) feet horizontal, and one inch equals ten (10) feet vertical, may be required by the planning commission.
10. Intersections
Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees.
To permit the construction of a curb or swale having a desirable radius, property line radii at all street intersections shall not be less than twenty (20) feet. Where the angle of the street intersection is less than ninety (90) degrees, the planning commission may require a greater radius.
11. Tangents
A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
12. Street jogs
Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall not be allowed.
13. Dead-end Streets
a. Minor terminal streets or courts within the city designed to have one end permanently closed shall be no more than six hundred (600) feet long unless necessitated by topography. Such streets in mountainous terrain in the unincorporated portions of the planning region may exceed six hundred (600) feet, but shall be no longer than twenty-five hundred (2,500) feet. All dead-end streets shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having an outside roadway diameter of at least eight (80) feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet or the planning commission may approve an alternate design such as the T or Y back-around. In cases where regional dead-end streets exceed six hundred (600) feet, the planning commission may require intermediate turn-arounds of an approved design in locations where the commission deems them necessary to promote the general public safety and convenience. (Amended by PC
23
action on 8/2001)
b. Where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary of such property. Such dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround.
14. Private Streets and reserve strips
There shall be no new private streets platted in any subdivision. Every subdivided property shall be served from a publicly dedicated street. There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the community under conditions approved by the planning commission.
15. Drainage
All streets and roads must be so designed as to provide for the discharge of surface water from the right-of-way. Where it is the opinion of the planning commission that water cannot be adequately discharged by surface drainage, the planning commission may require the installation of a storm sewer system.
16. Street Name
Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named, shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the name for proposed streets duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the use of suffix street, avenue boulevard, driveway, place, or court.
17. Alleys
Alleys may be provided to the rear of all lots used for business purposes, and shall not be provided in residential blocks.
a. Blocks
1. Length
Blocks shall not be less than four hundred (400) nor more than twelve hundred (1,200) feet in length, except as the planning commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street pattern. In blocks over eight hundred (800) feet in length the planning commission may require one or more public cross walks.
24
25
26
27
2. Width
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets or prevented by topographical conditions or size of the property.
C. Lots
1. Arrangement
a. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must front for a minimum of fifty (50) feet upon a public street or road which is not less than forty (40) feet in width.
2. Minimum size
The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such as the planning commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use contemplated. Where a municipal sanitary sewer owned and operated by the City of Pigeon Forge is reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall connect with such sewer and provide a connection to each lot. Where, in the opinion of the Pigeon Forge Regional Planning Commission, municipal sanitary sewer service is not reasonably accessible, alternative methods of sewage disposal may be used.
Acceptable alternative methods of sewage disposal include individual septic tank and drainfield systems approved by the Sevier County Health Department, with each lot having at least a “two-bedroom” designation. Also acceptable are public “on-site” sewage disposal systems as designated and approved by the Tennessee Regulatory Authority (TRA), and on-site systems owned and operated by a public utility provider established under Tennessee law. “Common septic systems” (serving two or more lots) and private on-site systems owned or operated by property owners associations are not acceptable alternatives to Pigeon Forge municipal sewer service.
a. Residential lots served by Pigeon Forge municipal sewers and municipal water lines shall not be less than seventy-five (75) feet wide at the building setback line nor less than seventy-five hundred (7,500) square feet in area, except mobile home lots shall be a minimum of five thousand (5,000) square feet.
b. Residential lots not served by Pigeon Forge municipal sewers (but having an acceptable alternative means of sewage disposal as set forth above), and having municipal water service, shall not be less
28
than eighty (80) feet wide at the building setback line, and shall contain a minimum of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet.
Greater area may be required if, in the opinion of the county health officer, there are factors of drainage, soil conditions, topography or other conditions to cause potential health problems. The planning commission may require that data from percolation tests be submitted as a basis for passing upon subdivisions dependent upon septic systems as a means of sewage disposal. Any percolation rate over 60 minutes per inch is prohibited.
c. Lots not served by municipal water systems must obtain water from private, individual wells only, and shall not be less than one hundred (100) feet wide at the building setback line and shall contain a minimum area of one acre, regardless of the type of sewage disposal system. As in subsection “b” above, greater area may be required at the discretion of the county health officer.
d. Tracts reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial properties must be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for such purposes.
e. The size and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the minimum requirements of any zoning ordinance in effect.
(Amended by PC action 9/2004, effective date 10/2004)
3. Building Setback Lines and Yard Requirements
a. The minimum depth of building setback lines from the street right-of-way line shall not be less than thirty (30) feet from minor residential and collector streets and forth (40) feet from all others. Lots in mountainous terrain in the unincorporated portions of the planning region which are served by minor residential streets may have a minimum building setback line from the street right-of-way line of not less than twenty (20) feet if the property slope from the right-of-way line exceeds thirty (30%) percent. In case of corner lots, provide a setback of fifteen (15) feet from the side street right-of-way lines unless a lower standard is allowed by the existing zoning ordinance. A minimum side yard of six (6) feet on one side for all lots and a total minimum side yard setback of fifteen (15) feet is required for interior lots. (Amended by PC action on 8/2001)
29
b. In the case of electric transmission lines where easement widths are not definitely established there shall be a minimum building setback line from the center of the transmission line as follows:
Voltage of line Minimum building setback
46 KV
37-1/2 feet
69 KV
50 feet
161 KV and over
75 feet
4. Corner Lots
Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to permit the additional side yard requirements of the zoning ordinance or building setback lines as outlined above.
D. Public Use and Service Areas
Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably located and of adequate size for playgrounds and parks for local or neighborhood use as well as public service area.
1. Public open space
Where a school, neighborhood park or recreation area or public access to water frontage, shown on an official map or in a plan made and adopted by the planning commission, is located in whole or in part in the applicant's subdivision, the planning commission may require the dedication or reservation of such open space within the subdivision up to a total of 10 percent of the gross area or water frontage of the plat, for park, school or recreation purposes.
2. for utilities
a. Drainage and utility easements shall be provided on each side and rear lot line where deemed necessary by the planning commission. The easements shall be designed to adequately provide utilities and drainage for all lots in the proposed subdivision. Where drainage is proposed to cross any lot at any point other than the side or corner of the lot, the plat shall indicate the size of the pipe necessary to carry the proposed runoff. Each cul-de-sac shall have provisions for a fifteen (15) foot utility easement extending there from to prevent dead-end water mains. Easements of the same or a greater width may be required along the lines of or across to where necessary for the extension of existing or planned utilities.
b. Storm sewers
30
Where in the opinion of the planning commission the flow of water cannot be accommodated with surface drainage, storm sewers or alternate system may be required. The planning commission shall determine, on the basis of the watershed and the probable runoff, the size of the storm sewers. In ascertaining the size of the storm sewers, the planning commission may call upon its technical staff or any public or private agency to assist in its determinations.
3. Water supply and sewerage connections
Where a public water supply or public sewerage system is reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall indicate a connection with such water supply or sewerage system and a water and sewerage connection for each lot with such material and to such size and length as shall be approved by the planning commission. Where a public water supply or public sewerage system is not reasonably accessible or not planned for in the future, an alternate method of water supply and sewage disposal may be indicated and shall be approved in writing by the county health officer.
4. Community Assets
In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as large trees, water courses, historical sites, and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property.
E. Suitability of the Land
The planning commission shall not approve the subdivision of land, if from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the public and site is not suitable for platting and development purpose of the kind proposed.
1. Flood Control Measure
Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate erosion of flood hazard. Such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
a. Fill may not be used to raise land in areas where the fill would increase flood levels.
31
b. All proposed developments containing land shown on the flood maps of Pigeon Forge and Sevier County shall identify the floodway and flood fringe area on the proposed development plan and the location of structures and improvements shall be subject to flood restrictions.
c. All development proposals shall have all public utilities and facilities located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
d. All development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
32
33
34
F. Large Tracts or parcels
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision.
G. Group Housing Developments
A comprehensive group housing development, including large scale construction of housing units and mobile home sites together with necessary drives and ways of access, may be approved by the planning commission, although the design of the project does not include standard street, lot and subdivision arrangements, if departure from the foregoing standards can be made without destroying their intent.
1. Planned Unit Development
For the purpose of these regulations, a planned unit development shall be a planned residential, commercial, or industrial development professionally designed as a unit on a parcel of land that may have separate ownership of, or acceptable lease arrangements and property in joint ownership. A planned unit development shall have ample open space provisions for the benefit and use of the residents. The open space shall be permanent and established in an appropriate manner. Planned unit developments shall include condominiums, mobile home parks, and similar group building developments formally or informally divided for development.
a. Planned unit developments shall generally comply with the standards established in these regulations, however, the uniqueness of each proposed development may require special consideration of these standards and they may be modified by the planning commission to achieve appropriate design arrangements.
b. The final site plan shall contain the location of proposed structures, roads, drives, parking, utilities, drainage, open space areas and all other requirements established for final approval.
c. A planned unit development plat shall show appropriate subdivision of properties.
d. No free standing building shall be closer than twenty (20) feet to any other free standing building and no closer than twenty-five (25) feet to any exterior property line.
e. Each development shall have a pedestrian circulation system plan and the walkways shall be improved a minimum of four (4) feet in width.
35
f. Any planned unit development within the corporate limits shall meet all requirements of the municipal zoning ordinance.
g. All planned unit developments shall be served by a municipal water system and a public sanitary sewer system. (Amended by PC action on 8/2006)
h. A final landscaping plan shall be required. Landscaping shall be designed to lessen noise, improve the visual appearance and create a pleasing environment.
i. A final open space plan shall be required. The open space shall be permanent and established through appropriate legal documents which shall be submitted with the plan. The documents shall show the manner or way in which the open space is owned and how it will be maintained. The open space plan shall also show all open space improvements such as swimming pools, tennis courts, golf courses, and similar open space uses.
j. Changes and modifications in the final planned unit development plan shall be submitted to the planning commission as a revision request of the approved planned unit development.
2. Mobile Home Parks
A proposed mobile home park shall be considered as a development informally dividing a land parcel into mobile home sites or spaces for the purpose of renting or leasing and it shall be considered as a planned unit development and plats shall be submitted to the planning commission for preliminary and final approval.
H. Mobile Home Subdivisions
The planning commission may approve a subdivision with lots designed and established EXCLUSIVELY for mobile homes. These developments shall comply with the standards and those established herein.
a. The minimum land parcel to be considered for a proposed mobile home subdivision shall be two (2) acres.
b. The minimum lot size for proposed developments with individual septic tank sewage disposal systems or other similar systems shall be ten thousand (10,000) square feet. For developments with lots serviced by a sanitary sewer system, the minimum lot size shall be five thousand (5,000) square feet. However, within the corporate
36
limits lot size will be determined by the density provisions in the zoning ordinance.
c. The minimum setbacks and yard requirements shall be the same as those established in these regulations.
d. Appropriate certificates shall be affixed to the final plat and appropriate legal documents shall be recorded to assure the planning commission that the proposed development shall be developed and utilized as mobile home lots exclusively.
I. Variances
Variances may be granted under the following conditions:
1. Where the subdivider can show that strict adherence to these regulations would cause unnecessary hardship, or
2. Where the planning commission determines that there are topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, and a departure from these regulations will not destroy their intent. Any variance thus authorized and the reasons therefore shall be stated in writing in the minutes of the planning commission.
J. Zoning or Other Regulations
No final plat of land within the force and effect of an existing zoning ordinance will be approved unless it conforms with such ordinance.
Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions noted herein and those contained in zoning regulations, building code, or other official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.
37
ARTICLE IV. DEVELOPMENT PREREQUISITE TO FINAL APPROVAL
A perfectly prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw acreage into lots suitable for building purposes and human habitation. Improvements by the subdivider spare the community from a potential tax liability. The following tangible improvements are required before final plat approval in order to assure the physical reality of a subdivision which approval and recordation will establish legally.
A. Required Improvements
Every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and improve streets and alleys, and to install needed curbs, monuments, sewers, storm water inlets and water mains in accordance with specifications established by the Pigeon Forge Regional Planning Commission. Where specifications adopted by local authorities conflict with standards as set forth in these subdivision regulations, the higher set of standards, as determined by the planning commission, shall govern.
1. Monuments
a. Concrete monuments four (4) inches in diameter or square, three (3) feet long, with a flat top, shall be set at all street corners, at all points where the street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision and at angle points and points of curb in each street. The top of the monuments shall have an indented cross to identify properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished grade.
b. All other corners and points shall be marked with iron pins.
2. Grading
All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded or filled horizontally to the full width of their rights-of-way by the subdivider or developer. Due to special topo-graphical conditions, deviation from the above will be allowed only with special approval of the planning commission.
a. Preparation. Before grading is started, necessary parts of the right-of-way area shall be cleared of all trees, stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable materials.
b. Cuts. All tree stumps, boulders and other obstructions shall be removed to a depth of two (2) feet below the subgrade. Rock, when encountered, shall be scarified to a depth of twelve (12) inches below subgrade.
38
c. Fill. All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed. Excess materials including organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall be removed from the development site. The fill shall be spread in layers not to exceed six (6) inches loose and compacted by a sheep's foot roller. Unless another method of preparation of the subgrade shall be constructed as specified in Section 203, Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Tennessee Department of Highways and Public Works - January 1, 1968, and later revisions thereto. The filling of utility trenches and other places not accessible to a roller shall be mechanically tamped, and where water is used to assist compaction the water content shall not exceed the optimum of moisture.
3. Storm drainage
An adequate drainage system, including storm sewers, necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full width roadway and the required slopes. The site openings to be provided shall be determined by Talbot's formula (in Appendix D), but in no case shall the pipe be less than fifteen (15) inches. Cross drains shall be built on straight line and grade, and shall be laid on a firm base but not on rock. Pipes shall be laid with spigot end pointing in the direction of the flow and with the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth uniform invert. They shall be placed at a sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall the top of the pipe be less than one (1) foot below the roadbed.
4. Roadway improvements
a. Base: compacted base course six (6) inches deep and three (3) feet wider than the width of the pavement on each side of the street shall be installed on all streets, including cul-de-sacs, temporary turn-arounds and access streets to adjoining properties, according to the method specified in Section 33, Standard Specifications for Roads and Bridge Construction, Tennessee Department of Highways and Public Works - January 1, 1968, and latest revisions thereto. Wetting of the stone before compaction may be done at a point of origin or on the job site at the option of the contractor.

b. Curbing
The subdivider shall provide curbs of no lower classification than machine formed concrete extruded curb, nine (9) inches wide at the base and seven and one-half (7 1/2) inches high. The curb shall be installed after the prime coat is applied to thebase. Back fill shall be towards the curb to insure drainage of surface water into the drainage system.
In lieu of curbs as the drainage system on cul-de-sacs and loop streets in the planning region, the planning commission may accept one of two alternatives: (1) swales may be used on streets where the finished grade does not exceed 2 percent; (2) streets with an inverted crown may used provided that the drainage area of the street does not exceed five (5) acres.
One-half (1/2) inch to three-fourth (3/4) inch expansion and contraction joints for the curbs and gutters shall be placed at intervals not exceeding forty (40) feet.
c. Prime Coat: After a thoroughly compacted base has been established, a prime coat shall be applied as specified in Section 402, Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Tennessee Department of Highways and Public Works - January 1, 1968, and latest revision thereto.
d. Wearing Surface: The weaving surface shall consist of a surface course constructed with asphalt concrete, prepared with mineral aggregate, laid hot as specified under Section 411, Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Tennessee Department of Highways and Public Works - January 1, l968, and latest revision thereto. It shall be constructed in one layer not less than two (2) inches thick to conform to the lines, grades and cross sections indicated on a plan approved by the inspecting engineer.
5. Minimum Street Improvement Widths
Due to the diversity of development in the planning region ranging from sparsely populated agricultural areas to the densely populated urban areas, required street improvement widths will necessarily vary with the character of building development and the amount of traffic encountered. Minimum widths for surface treatment of roads and streets shall be those indicated below.
a. Arterial streets…………………………..........(not paved by developer).
42
b. Collector streets....................................................................... 32 feet
c. Minor residential streets…………………………………………..26 feet Most minor streets in residential developments involve parking and/or considerable traffic.

e. Loop streets………………………………………………………..20 feet Maximum length 1,200 feet or 25 dwelling units.
f. Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs)………………………………….18 feet Maximum length 600 feet or 15 dwelling units.
g. Minor dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs)…………………………...16 feet Maximum length 300 feet or five dwelling units.
h. Rural streets………………………………………………………..20 feet Without curbs - minimum of one acre lots and 150 feet frontage. Pavement widths of 20 feet may be accepted on loop and dead-end (cul-de-sac) rural streets meeting the above standards of maximum length and dwelling units.
6. Installation of utilities
After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied, all of the underground works - water mains, gas mains, etc., and all service connections shall be installed completely and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. All driveways for houses to be built by the developer shall be cut and drained.
All driveways for houses to be built by the developer shall be cut and drained.
7. Water supply system
Water mains properly connected with the community water supply system or with an alternate supply approved by the county health officer shall be constructed in such a manner to adequately serve all lots shown on the sub-ivision plat for both domestic use and fire protection.
The size of water mains, the location and type of valves and hydrants, the amount of soil cover the pipes and other features of the installation shall be approved by the planning commission upon the recommendation of the Superintendent of Water Department or other applicable inspection
43
agencies, and shall conform with accepted standards of good practice for municipal water systems.
8. Sanitary sewers
a. Where lots cannot be economically connected with a sewerage system, they must contain adequate area for the installation of approved septic tank and disposal fields and must be approved in writing by the county health officer.
b. All lots connected to the city sewerage system shall meet all requirements of the water and sewer board.
c. All lots connected to a sewer system shall be approved by the utility operating the system. They shall meet all requirements of the state health department and shall be approved by the Sevier County Health Department.
d. Subdividers shall supply all data required for the installation and or operation of the sewerage system to the water and sewer board, Sevier County Health Department and the Tennessee State Department of Health.
9. Street name signs
Appropriate street signs also add sales value to land subdivisions and enable strangers, delivery concerns and even potential lot buyers to find their way around. Street names should appear at all intersections. Upon request the planning commission will aid the subdivider with specifications for the construction, placing and setting of such signs.
B. Guarantee in Lieu of Completed Improvements
No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the planning commission or accepted for record by the County Registrar of Deeds until one of the following conditions has been met:
1. All required improvements have been constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by the City of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.
2. The planning commission has accepted a security or performance bond in an amount equal to the estimated cost of installation of the required improvements, whereby improvements may be made and utilities installed without cost to the city in the event of default of the subdivider. The conditions of such security or performance bond shall provide for the installation of the improvements covered by such bond within a period of not
44
to exceed one (1) year; provided, however, that such period may be extended by the planning commission with the consent of the parties thereto if the planning commission finds that the public interest will not be adversely affected by such extension. If the planning commission shall decide at any time during the performance bond that the extent of the building development that has taken place in the subdivision is not sufficient to warrant all the improvements covered by such performance bond, that required improvements have been installed as provided in this Section in sufficient amount to warrant reduction in the face amount of said bond, or that the character and the extent of such development require additional improvements for any or all such improvements, the face value of such performance bond shall thereupon be reduced or increased by an appropriate amount so that the new face amount will cover the cost in full of the amended list of improvements.
Performance bonds which are submitted in lieu of the installation of required improvements shall be in cash or made by a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Tennessee. In the case of a surety company, the performance bond shall be prepared according to the form as shown in Appendix A, said Appendix A is made a part of these subdivision regulations.
ARTICLE V. REGULATIONS FOR THE REVIEW AND
APPROVAL OF MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
This article sets forth procedures designed to expedite the review and approval process for minor subdivisions. Due to the nature of minor subdivisions, no development other than the platting process is required. Therefore, Article IV of the Pigeon Forge Subdivision Regulations does not apply to minor subdivisions.
A. Definition
In order to be considered a minor subdivision the tract or parcel of land to be subdivided shall be located in an existing open public road that has been accepted and is being maintained by the county or state highway departments and shall be situated in a manner that there are no changes in existing streets, no new streets or easements of access, and no excavation, grading or physical development needed and the property must be adequately provided with existing community facilities to the extent that no extensions of water, sewer or gas lines are required.
B. General Requirements
All requirements and design standards including requirements for the preparation of subdivision plats will be the same as set forth in Article I through III of the Pigeon Forge Subdivision Regulations.
45
Minor subdivisions will be considered for official approval at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Pigeon Forge Planning Commission. In the event that it places an extreme and undue hardship on the developer or selling agent a special review committee may review the subdivision prior to the regular monthly meeting. The special review committee may grant tentative approval and permission to sell pending official approval by the Pigeon Forge Regional Planning Commission. The following procedures and policies shall govern the review and approval of minor subdivisions:
1. At least ten (10) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered, the subdivider shall submit to the secretary of the planning commission or the planning commission technical staff four (4) copies of the subdivision plat.
2. Requests for special review and approval due to hardship must be accompanied by a statement explaining the nature of the hardship and reasons why special review is necessary.
3. Preliminary approval may be granted prior to health department approval (includes layout design of the subdivision and development requirements).
4. Permission to sell subject to final approval may be granted by the full commission or the minor subdivision committee.
5. Permission to see cannot be granted unless the plat has received health department approval.
6. Subdivisions must be properly marked at all corners and survey points with iron pipe or solid steel rods not less than one half (1/2) inches in diameter and twenty-four (24) inches in length.
7. If permission to sell is granted, the sale is made subject to any changes or additional requirements requested by the planning commission for final approval and buyers of the property shall be properly informed of this con-dition by the person or persons selling the property.
ARTICLE VI. ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS
The enforcement of these regulations and penalties for the unapproved recordation or transfer of land is provided by state law in the authority granted by public acts of the State of Tennessee.
A. Enforcement
1. No plat or plan of a subdivision of land into two (2) or more lots located within the Pigeon Forge Planning Region shall be admitted to the land records of
46
the county or received or recorded by the County Registrar of Deeds until said plat or plan has received final approval in writing by the planning commission as provided in Section 13-3-402, Tennessee Code Annotated.
2. No board, public officer, or authority shall light any road, lay or authorize the laying of water mains or sewers, or the construction of other facilities or utilities in any road located within the planning region unless such road shall have been accepted, opened or otherwise received the legal status of a public road prior to the adoption of these regulations, or unless such road corresponds in its location and lines to a road shown on a subdivision plat approved by the planning commission, or on a road plan made and adopted by the commission as provided in Section 13-3-406, Tennessee Code Annotated.
B. Penalties
1. No county registrar shall receive, file, or record a plat of a subdivision within the planning region without the approval of the planning commission as required in Section 13-3-402, Tennessee Code Annotated, and any county registrar so doing shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by law.
2. Sections 13-3-410 and 13-4-306, Tennessee Code Annotated, provides that "Whoever being the owner or agent of the owner of any land, transfers or sells or agrees to sell or negotiates to sell such land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of subdivision of such land without having submitted a plat of such subdivision to the planning commission and obtained its approval as required by this Act and before such plat be recorded in the office of the county registrar, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by the law; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties." In the case of the regional planning commission, Section 13-3-410 provides that the county through its county attorney, or other official designated by the quarterly county court may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by action or injunction.
3. Any building or structure erected or to be erected in violation of the subdivision regulations shall be deemed an unlawful building or structure, and the building commissioner or the solicitor of the municipality or other official designated by the chief legislative body and/or county attorney or other official designated by the quarterly county court may bring action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed as provided in Section 13-3-411, Tennessee Code Annotated.
47
ARTICLE VII. ADOPTION AND EFFECTIVE DATE
A. Before adoption of these subdivision regulations or any amendment thereof, a public hearing thereon shall be held by the planning commission; thirty (30) days' notice of the time and place of which shall be given by one (1) publication in a newspaper of general circulation in each county lying wholly or partly in the planning region.

singular; words used in the present tense shall include the future tense. The word
"shall" is mandatory and not discretionary. The word "may" is permissive.
Words not defined in this section shall be construed to have the meaning given by
common and ordinary use as defined in the latest edition of Webster's Dictionary.
(1) Agricultural operations. Activities related to the production of goods through the
growing of plants and/or animals.
(2) As built plans - means drawings depicting conditions as they were actually constructed.
(3) Base flood. The flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
(4) Best management practices - or BMPs are physical, structural, and/or managerial
practices that, when used singly or in combination, prevent or reduce pollution of water,
that have been approved by the City of Pigeon Forge, and that have been incorporated by
reference into this ordinance as if fully set out therein.
(5) Blue line stream. Any stream, creek, lake, pond, or other body of water shown as a blue
line on a 7.5 minute USGS quadrangle map.
(6) Board of Mayor and City Commissioners (City Council). The governing body of the
City of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.
(7) Buffer Zone. As used in this ordinance, a strip of undisturbed perennial native
vegetation, either original or re-established, that borders streams and rivers, ponds and
lakes, wetlands and seeps. Buffer zones are established for the purposes of slowing water
runoff, enhancing water infiltration, and minimizing the risk of any nutrients or pollutants
from pollutants from leaving the upland area and reaching surface waters.
(8) Channel - means a natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed and banks that
conducts flowing water continuously or periodically.
(9) Clearing - Typically refers to the removal of vegetation and disturbance of soil prior to

physical demarcation (including boundary signs, lot stakes, survey markings, etc.)
indicating construction activities may occur on a specific plot. A common plan of
development or sale identifies a situation in which multiple areas of disturbance are
occurring on contiguous areas. This applies because the activities may take place at
different times, on different schedules, by different operators.
(12)Contaminant - means any physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance or
matter in water.
8

discharge from a site is causing, contributing to or is likely
to contribute to a violation of a state water quality
violation;
(b) The Authority has determined that a stormwater
discharge is, or is likely to be a significant contributor of
pollutants to waters of the state, or;
(c) Changes in state or federal rules require sites of less that
one acre that are not part of a larger common plan of
development or sale to obtain a stormwater permit.;
(4) The creation and use of borrow pits where material is excavated
and relocated offsite, and fill sites where materials or earth is
deposited by mechanized methods resulting in an increase
elevation or grade;.

long as it conforms to conditions established by the Pigeon Forge Public
Works Dept. Storm Water Technician
(c) No development plans will be released until the land disturbance permit
has been approved.
(d) Disclaimer of liability. Neither the submission of a plan under the
provisions herein, nor compliance with the provisions of these regulations
shall relieve any person from responsibility for damages to any person or
property otherwise imposed by law: nor impose any liability upon the City
of Pigeon Forge or its representatives for damages to any person or
property.
(6). Permit duration.
Every land disturbance permit may expire and become null and void if in the
judgment of the Public Works Dept. Storm Water Technician substantial work
authorized by such permit has not commenced within one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days of issuance, or has not been completed within an amount of time
deemed reasonable by the Public Works Dept. Storm Water Technician
(7). Notice of construction.
The applicant must notify the Pigeon Forge Public Works Dept. Storm Water
Technician at least ten (10) working days in advance of the commencement of
construction. Inspections of the stormwater management system construction
may be conducted by the Pigeon Forge Public Works Dept. Storm Water
Technician
(8). Performance bonds.
(a) The Pigeon Forge Public Works Dept. Storm Water Technician may, at its
discretion, require the submittal of a performance security or performance
bond prior to issuance of a permit in order to ensure that the stormwater
practices are installed by the permit holder as required by the approved
stormwater management plan. The bond provider shall be responsible to
keep the bond in effect until such time the bond is released by the City of
Pigeon Forge Public Works Dept. Storm Water InTechnician in the event
the bond provider allows the bond to expire, the bond provider shall be
responsible for the cost of completion of the work required by the permit
and be responsible for any damages resulting from non-completion of the
work. The amount of the installation performance security or performance
bond shall be the total estimated construction cost of the structural BMPs
approved under the permit plus any reasonably foreseeable additional
related costs, e.g., for damages or enforcement. [Or plus a certain
percentage of the total estimated costs.] The performance security shall
contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified in the
stormwater management plan. The applicant shall provide an itemized
construction cost estimate complete with unit prices which shall be subject
16
to acceptance, amendment or rejection by the Pigeon Forge Public Works
Dept. Storm Water Technician Alternatively the Pigeon Forge Public
Works Dept. Storm Water Technician shall have the right to calculate the
cost of construction cost estimates.

plan and other applicable provisions of this ordinance may be required at
the discretion of the Forge Public Works Dept. Storm Water Technician
The Pigeon Forge Public Works Dept. Storm Water Technician may make
a final inspection of the structural BMP to ensure that it is in compliance
with the approved plan and the provisions of this ordinance. Provisions
for a partial pro-rata release of the performance security or performance
bond based on the completion of various development stages may be made
at the discretion of the Pigeon Forge Public Works DirectorStormwater
Technician or his designee.
(9) Transfer of Ownership
(a) Some construction projects, such as residential or commercial
subdivisions and/ or developments or industrial parks are subdivided.
Subdivided lots are sometimes sold to new owners prior to completion of
construction. The site wide developer/ owner must describe erosion
control and sediment prevention measures implemented at those lots. Once
the property is sold, the new operator must obtain coverage under this
permit.
(b) If the transfer of ownership is due to foreclosure or a permittee filing for
bankruptcy proceedings, the new owner (including but not limited to a
lending institution) must obtain permit coverage if the property is inactive,
but is not stabilized sufficiently. If the property is sufficiently stabilized
permit coverage may not be necessary, unless and until construction
activity at the site resumes.
(10) Inspections
(a) The permit holder shall perform inspections of erosion prevention and
sediment control practices on all construction sites as indicated by the
current “NPDES Permit for Discharges Associated with Construction
Activities” twice weekly and at least 72 hours apart (3.5.8.2). This
standard is the same for “priority construction sites”. Based on the results
of the inspections, any inadequate control measures or control measures in
disrepair shall be replaced or modified, or repaired as necessary, before
the next rain event if possible. Inspections should be documented. Quality
17
assurance of erosion prevention and sediment controls shall be done by
performing site assessment at a construction site. The site assessment shall
be conducted at each outfall involving drainage totaling 10 acres or more
(of disturbed and undisturbed acreage combined) or 5 or more acres if
draining to impaired or exceptional quality waters, within 1 month of
construction commencing. The site assessment shall be performed by
individuals with one or more of the following qualifications:
(1) A licensed professional engineer or landscape architect;
(2) A Certified Professional in Erosion and Sediment Control
(CPESC); or
(3) A person that has successfully completed the “Level II
Design Principles for Erosion Prevention and Sediment
Control for Construction Sites” course.
As a minimum, a site assessment should be performed to verify the
installation, functionality and performance of the erosion prevention and
sediment control measures described in the SWPPP. The site assessment
findings shall be documented and the documentation kept with the SWPPP
on site. The site assessment should be performed with the site inspector,
and should include a review and update (if applicable) of the SWPPP.
Modifications of plans and specifications for any building or structure,
including the design of sediment basin or other sediment controls
involving structural, hydraulic, hydrologic or other engineering
calculations shall be performed by a licensed engineer or landscape
architect and stamped and certified in accordance with state law. The site
assessment can take the place of one of the twice weekly inspections.
(b) The Stormwater Authority shall perform inspections on priority
construction sites, and other construction sites as warranted by site
location and complaints. If the Stormwater Authority finds that the permit
holder has failed to properly install, maintain, or use proper structural
and/or vegetative erosion and sediment control practices as specified in the
erosion and sediment control plan and the post construction design and
maintenance plan the permit holder may be subject to a notice of violation
order or additional penalties as set forth in Section eight (8) of this
ordinance.
(c) The Stormwater Authority may require an inspection by a registered
Engineer licensed in the State of Tennessee, if deemed necessary, for any
erosion and sediment control measure or post construction stormwater
management facility to ensure they meet the design standards as described
in the Construction Site and Post Construction Site plans.
(d) If the Stormwater Authority determines that significant erosion and/or
sedimentation is occurring on a graded site despite approved structural
and/or vegetative erosion and sediment control practices, the Stormwater
18
Authority shall require the permit holder to take additional corrective
action to protect the adversely affected area. The additional corrective
action required shall be part of an amended erosion and sediment control
plan.
(e) Where sites or portions of construction sites have been temporarily
stabilized, or runoff is unlikely due to winter conditions (e.g., site covered
with snow or ice) or due to extreme drought, such inspection only has to
be conducted one per month until thawing or precipitation results in runoff
or construction activity resumes. Inspection requirements do not apply to
definable areas that have been finally stabilized.
(f) Inspections and maintenance for post construction stormwater facilities
shall be performed as required in Section five (5) for post construction
design and maintenance.
(11) Appeals. Appeals may be made to the Stormwater Appeals Board as outlined in
Section 9 of this Ordinance.
19
Section 4. Stormwater System Design and Management Standards.
(1) Storm water design or BMP manual.
(a) The City adopts as its storm water design and best management practices
(BMP) manual the most recent edition and/or amendment following
publications, which are incorporated by reference in this ordinance as is
fully set out herein:
(1) TDEC Sediment and Erosion Control Manual
(2) TDEC Manual for Post Construction
(b) This manual includes a list of acceptable BMPs including the specific
design performance criteria and operation and maintenance requirements
for each storm water practice. The manual may be updated and expanded
from time to time, at the discretion of the governing body of the
municipality, upon the recommendation of the Stormwater Technician,
based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and local
maintenance experience. Storm water facilities that are designed,
constructed and maintained in accordance with these BMP criteria will be
presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.
(2). General performance criteria for storm water management. The following
performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all sites:
Storm Event Design Criteria. All site designs shall control the peak flow rates of
storm water discharge associated with the one (1) year, two (2) year, five (5) year,
and ten (10) year, year NRCS Type II twenty-four (24) hour design storm
frequency and reduce the generation of post construction storm water runoff to
pre-construction quantities.
(a) These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment
and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops,
parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide
treatment for both water quality and quantity. Whenever detention or
retention ponds are employed as part of a storm water management system,
then such ponds and related storm water management equipment and facilities
shall be maintained in perpetuity, as provided for in Section 4, subsection (4)
(g) below.
(b) To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel protection
criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the BMP manual, and as set out in
4(6) below.
(c) Storm water discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., cold
water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, water
supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may
need to utilize or restrict certain storm water management practices.
(d) Storm water discharges from Hot Spots may require the application of specific
structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices.
(e) Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land disturbance
permits shall consult with the Stormwater Technician to determine if they are
subject to additional storm water design requirements.
20
(f) The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the BMP manual
shall be used for sizing all storm water facilities.
(g). Minimum control requirements.
(1) Effective erosion prevention and sediment controls should be designed,
installed and maintained to minimize the discharge of pollutants. At a
minimum, such controls must be designed, installed and maintained to:
(i) Control stormwater volume and velocity within the site to minimize
soil erosion;
(ii) Control stormwater discharges, including both peak flow rates and
total stormwater volume, to minimize erosion at outlets and to
minimize downstream channel stream bank erosion;
(iii) Minimize the amount of soil exposed during construction activity;
(iv)Minimize the disturbance of steep slopes;
(v) Eliminate (or minimize if complete elimination is not possible)
sediment discharges from the site. The design, installation and
maintenance of erosion prevention and sediment controls must address
factors such as the design storm and soils characteristics, including the
range of soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site;
(vi)Provide and maintain natural buffers around surface waters, direct
stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment removal and
maximize stormwater infiltration, unless infeasible; and
(vii) Minimize soil compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil
(2) Storm water designs shall meet the multi-stage storm frequency storage
requirements as identified in Section 4(2)(a).
(3) Detention of storm water shall be required if there is to be a net increase in
runoff from the site during a ten (10) year storm event following
development (or redevelopment), regardless of the size of the site; or, if
the site will contain one-half (1/2) acre or more of impervious area
(driveways, parking lots, sidewalks, patios, roofs) following development
(or redevelopment). Where a detention pond or retention pond, and related
equipment and facilities are designed and intended to provide storm water
management for more than one lot and/or for more than one property
owner, such as is the case for residential and commercial subdivisions, and
residential and commercial condominiums, including interval ownership
(time-share) tourist housing, then a legally established property owner’s
association shall have the responsibility of ownership and maintenance of
such areas in perpetuity. The maintenance plan and maintenance
agreement shall be constructed as provided for in Section 4(4)(g) of this
ordinance.
(4) Soil, sediment, and debris brought onto streets, roads and public ways
must be removed by the end of the work day by machine, broom, shovel,
etc. to the satisfaction of the Authority. Any time work is performed on or
adjacent to any road safety will be the primary consideration. Safety
considerations will extend to the traveling public, local bystanders, and
work crews. Work crews will strictly adhere to the Manual of Uniform
21
Traffic Control Devices, Part VI, Work Zone Safety. Failure to remove the
sediment, soil or debris shall be deemed as a violation of this ordinance.
(5) If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that
provided by the minimum control requirements, the Stormwater
Technician may impose any and all additional requirements deemed
necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
(3). Storm water management plan requirements. The storm water management
plan shall include sufficient information to allow the Stormwater Technician to
evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts
of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water
resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for
managing storm water generated at the project site. To accomplish this goal the
storm water management plan shall include the following:
(a) Topographic Base Map: A 1" = 100’ topographic base map of the site,
unless otherwise required by site conditions, which extends a minimum of
fifty (50) feet beyond the limits of the proposed development and
indicates:
(1) Existing surface water drainage including streams, ponds, culverts,
ditches, sink holes, wetlands, high quality and/or impaired streams;
and the type, size, elevation, etc., of nearest upstream and
downstream drainage structures;
(2) Current land use including all existing structures, locations of
utilities, roads, and easements;
(3) All other existing significant natural and artificial features;
(4) Proposed land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area
to be adapted to various uses; drainage patterns; locations of
utilities, roads and easements; the limits of clearing and grading;
(5) Proposed structural BMPs. In instances in which a detention or
retention basin is to be employed as a part of the storm water
management system, the outlet structures from such basins shall be
reinforced concrete pipe (RCP);
(6) A written description of the site plan and justification of proposed
changes in natural conditions may also be required, as set forth by
the Stormwater Technician.
(b) Calculations: Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the predevelopment
and post-development conditions for the design storms
specified in the BMP manual. These calculations must show that the
proposed storm water management measures are capable of controlling
runoff from the site in compliance with this ordinance and the guidelines
of the BMP manual. Such calculations shall include:
(1) A description of the design storm frequency, duration, and
intensity where applicable;
(2) Time of concentration;
(3) Soil curve numbers or runoff coefficients including assumed soil
moisture conditions;
22
(4) Peak runoff rates and total runoff volumes for each watershed area;
(5) Infiltration rates, where applicable;
(6) Culvert, storm water sewer, ditch and/or other storm water
conveyance capacities;
(7) Flow velocities;
(8) Data on the increase in rate and volume of runoff for the design
storms referenced in the BMP manual; and
(9) Documentation of sources for all computation methods and field
test results.
(c) Soils Information:
(1) If a storm water management control measure depends on the
hydrologic properties of soils (e.g., infiltration basins), then a soils
report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site
boring logs or soil pit profiles and soil survey reports. The number
and location of required soil borings or soil pits shall be
determined based on what is needed to determine the suitability
and distribution of soil types present at the location of the control
measure.
(2) Instances in which pipes, culverts, or other types of storm water or
utility conduits are located within and/or pass through an earthen
berm, special care shall be taken to choose an appropriate soil type,
which is properly compacted so that all piping remains stable and
watertight.
(d) Runoff Reduction. Site design for all new and redevelopment projects
require, in combination or alone, management measures that are designed,
built and maintained to infiltrate, evapotranspire, harvest and/or use, at a
minimum, the first inch of every rainfall event preceded by 72 hours of no
measureable precipitation. This first inch of rainfall must be 100%
managed with no discharge to surface waters.
(1) Limitations to the application of runoff reduction requirements
include, but are not limited to:
(a) Where a potential for introducing pollutants into the
groundwater exists, unless pretreatment is provided;
(b) Where pre-existing soil contamination is present in areas
subject to contact with infiltrated runoff;
(c) Presence of sinkholes or karst features;
(d) Pre-development infiltrative capacity of soils at the site
must be taken into account in selection of runoff reduction
management measures.
(e) Incentive Standards for redeveloped sites: a 10% reduction
in the volume of rainfall to be managed for any of the
following types of developments. Such credits are additive
so that a maximum reduction of 50% of the runoff
reduction requirements for a project that meets all 5
criteria:
23
(1) Redevelopment;
(2) Brownfield redevelopment;
(3) High density (>7 units per acre);
(4) Vertical density
(5) Mixed use and Transit Oriented Development
(within ½ mile).
(e) Pollutant Removal. For projects that cannot meet 100% of the runoff
reduction requirement unless subject to the incentive standards, the
remainder of the stipulated amount of rainfall must be treated prior to
discharge with a technology reasonably expected to remove 80% of the
total suspended solids (TSS). The treatment technology must be designed,
installed and maintained to continue to meet this performance standard.
(f) Off-site Mitigation. For projects that cannot meet 100% of the runoff
reduction requirements, the Authority may allow runoff reduction
measures to be implemented at another location within the same USGS
12- digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) as the original project. Off-site
mitigation must be a minimum of 1.5 times the amount of water not
managed on site. The off-site mitigation location (or alternative location
outside the HUC 12) and runoff reduction measures must be approved by
the Authority. The Authority shall identify priority areas within the
watershed in which mitigation projects can be completed to the applicant.
The Authority will select the mitigation project from an inventory of
appropriate mitigation projects. The project must meet appropriate
institutional standards and provide whatever effort is required to assist the
Authority to value, to evaluate, and track the transaction. Mitigation can
be used for retrofit or redevelopment projects, but should be avoided in
areas of new development.
(g) Maintenance and Repair Plan: The design and planning of all storm
water management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair
procedures to ensure their continued performance. These plans will
identify the parts or components of a storm water management facility that
need to be maintained and the equipment and skills or training necessary.
Provisions for the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness of
the maintenance program and the need for revisions or additional
maintenance procedures shall be included in the plan. A permanent
elevation benchmark shall be identified in the plans to assist in the
periodic inspection of the facility.
(h) Landscaping Plan: The applicant must present a detailed plan for
management of vegetation at the site after construction is finished,
including who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the
site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate
vegetative cover is preserved. This landscaping plan shall comply with
the City of Pigeon Forge Zoning Ordinance.
(i) Maintenance Easements: The applicant must ensure access to the site for
the purpose of inspection and repair by securing all the maintenance
easements needed. These easements must be binding on the current
24
property owner and all subsequent owners of the property and must be
properly recorded in the Register of Deeds Office for Sevier County
Tennessee.
(j) Maintenance Agreement:
(1) The owner of property to be served by an on-site storm water
management facility must execute an inspection and maintenance
agreement that shall operate as a deed restriction binding on the
current property owner and all subsequent property owners, and
shall be recorded in the Register of Deeds Office for Sevier
County, Tennessee.
(2) The maintenance agreement shall:
(a) Assign responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the
storm water facility to the owner of the property upon
which the facility is located and be recorded as such on the
plat for the property by appropriate notation.
(b) Provide for a periodic inspection by the property owner for
the purpose of documenting maintenance and repair needs
and ensure compliance with the purpose and requirements
of this ordinance. The property owner will arrange for this
inspection to be conducted by a registered professional
engineer licensed to practice in the State of Tennessee who
will submit a sealed report of the inspection to the City
Engineer. It shall also grant permission to the city to enter
the property at reasonable times and to inspect the storm
water facility to ensure that it is being properly maintained.
(c) Provide that the minimum maintenance and repair needs
include, but are not limited to: the removal of silt, litter and
other debris, the cutting of grass, grass cuttings and
vegetation removal, and the replacement of landscape
vegetation, in detention and retention basins, and inlets and
drainage pipes and any other storm water facilities. It shall
also provide that the property owner shall be responsible
for additional maintenance and repair needs consistent with
the needs and standards outlined in the BMP manual.
(d) Provide that maintenance needs must be addressed in a
timely manner, on a schedule to be determined by the City
Engineer.
(e) Provide that if the property is not maintained or repaired
within the prescribed schedule, the City of Pigeon Forge (or
its contractor) shall perform the maintenance and repair at
its expense, and bill the same to the property owner. The
maintenance agreement shall also provide that the City of
Pigeon Forge’s cost of performing the maintenance shall be
a lien against the property, shall run with the land and be
recorded in the Register of Deeds Office for Sevier County
Tennessee.
25
(3) The City shall have the discretion to accept the dedication of any
existing or future storm water management facility, provided such
facility meets the requirements of this ordinance, and includes
adequate and perpetual access and sufficient areas, by easement or
otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. Any storm
water facility accepted by the City must also meet the City’s
construction standards and any other standards and specifications
that apply to the particular storm water facility in question.
(a) Sediment and Erosion Control Plans: The applicant must
prepare a sediment and erosion control plan for all
construction activities that complies with Section 4(5)
below.
(b) Buffer Plans: The applicant must prepare a buffer plan for
all streams, rivers, creeks, ponds, lakes, or other bodies of
water that complies with Section 4(6) below.
(4). Sediment and erosion control plan requirements. The sediment and erosion
control plan shall accurately describe the potential for soil erosion and
sedimentation problems resulting from land disturbing activity and shall explain
and illustrate the measures that are to be taken to control these problems. The
plan shall incorporate designs and standards as described in the current BMP
manual adopted in this ordinance as well as the current Tennessee Construction
General Permit (TNCGP). The length and complexity of the plan is to be
commensurate with the size of the project, severity of the site condition, and
potential for off-site damage. A registered professional engineer licensed in the
state of Tennessee shall seal the plan.
Erosion prevention and sediment control measures shall be designed according to
the size and slope of disturbed drainage areas with the goal of detaining runoff
and trapping sediment. Erosion prevention and sediment controls shall be
designed to control the rainfall and runoff from a 2 year, 24 hour storm, as a
minimum. For sites with over 10 acres disturbed at one time a temporary (or
permanent) sediment basin that provides storage for a calculated volume of runoff
from a 2-year, 24 hour storm for each acre drained, or equivalent control
measures, shall be provided until final stabilization of the site. Where no such
calculation has been performed, a temporary (or permanent) sediment basin
providing 3,600 cubic feet of storage per acre drained, or equivalent control
measures, shall be provided until final stabilization of the site.
All sites that are draining to either sediment impaired or high quality waters
identified by TDEC on the most current 303(d) list shall be designed at a
minimum to control storm runoff generated by a 5-year, 24 hour storm event.
For sites over 5 acres that are draining to either sediment impaired or high quality
waters, refer to the latest edition of the Tennessee Construction General Permit
(TNCGP) Section 4.4 Discharge Into Impaired or High Quality Waters for design
controls.
The plan shall also conform to the requirements found in the BMP manual, and
shall include at least the following:
26
(a) Project Description - Briefly describe the intended project and proposed land
disturbing activity including number of units and structures to be constructed
and infrastructure required.
(b) Identify all potential sources of pollution which are likely to affect the quality
of stormwater discharges from the construction site;
(c) Describe practices to be used to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharges
from the construction/ permitted site;
(d) Assure compliance with the terms and conditions of this permit.
(e) A general location map (e.g. portion of a county tax map or similar plat)
indicating the locations of existing roads or landmarks, any high quality
and/or impaired streams, drainage patterns and approximate slopes anticipated
after major activities, areas of soil disturbance and outline of areas that are not
to be disturbed, the size and location of major structural and nonstructural
controls identified in the plan, the location of areas where stabilization
practices are expected to occur, the location of receiving water(s), locations of
discharges into or immediately up stream of high quality or impaired waters,
wetlands, sinkholes and all outfalls where runoff will leave the property
should be identified. Stream(s) receiving the discharge, and storm sewer
system(s) conveying the discharge from all site outfalls should be clearly
identified and marked on the map. NOIs for linear projects must specify the
location of each end of the construction area and all areas to be disturbed.
Commercial and/ or industrial builders that develop separate SWPPPs that
cover only their portion of the project shall also submit a site or plat map that
clearly indicates the lot(s) which they are applying for permit coverage and
the location of streams, conveyances, storm sewer connections and outfalls
leaving the permitted portion of the property
(f) Where properties, lots and/or parcels have an average of 20% slope or greater,
detailed development and design standards shall be referred to within the
“Critical Slope Overlay Zone” (steep slope) requirements adopted in the
current Sevier County Zoning Resolution. Additional drainage system design
criteria are established for street designs, ditches, grades, driveway accesses,
utilities placements, as well as “as-built” certifications, etc., within the current
Sevier County Subdivision Regulations. Also, when steep slopes and/ or fine
particle soils are present at the site, additional physical or chemical treatment
of stormwater runoff may be required.
(g) A topographic map with contour intervals of five (5) feet or less showing
present conditions and proposed contours resulting from land disturbing
activity.
(h) All existing drainage ways, including intermittent and wet-weather. Include
any designated floodways or flood plains and high quality and/or impaired

(i) A general description of existing land cover. Individual trees and shrubs do
not need to be identified.
(j) Stands of existing trees as they are to be preserved upon project completion,
specifying their general location on the property. Differentiation shall be
made between existing trees to be preserved, trees to be removed and
27
proposed planted trees. Tree protection measures must be identified, and the
diameter of the area involved must also be identified on the plan and shown to
scale. Complete landscape plans may be submitted separately.
(k) Approximate limits of proposed clearing, grading and filling.
(l) Approximate flow volumes of existing storm water leaving any portion of the
site.
(m)A general description of existing soil types and characteristics and any
anticipated soil erosion and sedimentation problems resulting from existing

include projected effects on property adjoining the site and on existing
drainage facilities and systems, including but not limited to high quality
and/or impaired waters, wetlands, sinkholes, and locations where storm water
is discharged to surface water. The plan must address the adequacy of outfalls
from the development: when water is concentrated, what is the capacity of
waterways, if any, accepting storm water off-site; and what measures,
including infiltration, sheeting into buffers, etc., are going to be used to
prevent the scouring of waterways and drainage areas off-site, etc.
(r) The projected sequence of work represented by the grading, drainage and
sedimentation and erosion control plans as related to other major items of
construction, beginning with the initiation of excavation and including the
construction of any sediment basins or retention facilities or any other
structural BMP’s.
(s) Specific remediation measures to prevent erosion and sedimentation run-off.

(t) Specific details for: the construction of rock pads, wash down pads, and
settling basins for controlling erosion; road access points; eliminating or
keeping soil, sediment, and debris on streets and public ways at a level
acceptable to the Stormwater Technician. Soil, sediment, and debris brought
onto streets and public ways must be removed by the end of the workday by
machine, broom or shovel to the satisfaction of the Stormwater Technician.
Failure to remove the sediment, soil or debris shall be deemed a violation of
this ordinance.
(u) Proposed structures; location (to the extent possible) and identification of any
proposed additional buildings, structures or development on the site.
(v) A description of on-site measures to be taken to recharge surface water into
the ground water system through infiltration.
28
(w)The SWPP must include documentation supporting a determination of permit
eligibility with regard to waters that have an approved TMDL for pollutant of
concern, including:
(1) Identification of whether the discharge is identified, either specifically or
generally, in an approved TMDL and any associated wasteload allocations,
site specific requirements, and assumptions identified for the construction
stormwater discharge;
(2) Summaries of consultation with the Authority and TDEC on consistency
of SWPPP conditions with the approved TMDL, and;
(3) Measures taken to ensure that the discharge of TMDL identified pollutants
from the site are consistent with the assumptions and requirements of the
approved TMDL, including any specific waste-load allocation that has been
established that would apply to the construction stormwater discharge.
(x) The plan shall include detailed drawings of all structural and non-structural
controls and stabilization measures which shall be designed to minimize
erosion and maximize sediment removal resulting in storm water discharge
associated with the two (2) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm event as
a minimum, either from total rainfall in the designated period or the
equivalent intensity as specified on the following website
http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pdfs/orb/tn_pdfs.html. These specific details
for constructing stabilized construction entrance/exits, concrete washouts,
sediment basins for controlling erosion, and road access points, etc., should be
designed to eliminate or keep soils, sediment, and/or debris to a minimum.
(y) Other Items needing control:
1. No solid materials, including building materials, shall be placed in waters
of the state, except as authorized by a section 404 permit and/ or ARAP
permit.
2. For installation of any waste disposal systems on site, or sanitary sewer or
septic system, the SWPPP shall identify these systems and provide for the
necessary erosion prevention and sediment controls. Permittees must also
comply with applicable state and/ or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer
or septic system regulations for such systems to the extent these are
located within the permitted area.
3. The SWPPP shall include a description of construction and waste
materials expected to be stored on site. The SWPPP shall also include a
description of controls used to reduce pollutants from materials stored on
site, including storage practices to minimize exposure of the materials to
stormwater, and spill prevention and response.
4. A description of stormwater sources from areas other than construction
and a description of controls and measures that will be implemented at
those sites.
5. A description of measures necessary to prevent a “taking” of legally
protected state or federal listed threatened or endangered aquatic fauna
and/ or critical habitat (if applicable). The Permittee must describe and
implement such measures to maintain eligibility for coverage under this
permit.
29
(z) Plans Modification(s)
(i) A SWPPP must be modified and updated if any of the following are
met:
1. Whenever there is a change in the scope of the project, which
would be expected to have a significant effect on the discharge of
pollutants to the waters of the state and which has not otherwise
been addressed in the SWPPP;
2. When inspections or investigations by site inspectors, local, state
or federal officials indicate the SWPP is proving ineffective in
eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants from being
discharged, or is otherwise not achieving the general objectives of
controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges associated with
construction activity.
3. To identify any new permittee (e.g., owner, contractor, subcontractor)
as needed to reflect operational or design control that
will implement a measure of the SWPPP;
4. To include measures necessary to prevent a negative impact to
legally protected state or federally listed fauna or flora;
5. A TMDL is developed for the receiving water(s) for a pollutant of
concern (siltation and/ or habitat alteration)
(ii) In the event the Authority finds that a Permittee is complying with the
SWPPP, but contributing to the impairment of a receiving stream, then the
discharger will be notified by the Authority in writing that the discharge is
no longer eligible for coverage under the general permit. The Permittee
may update the SWPPP and implement the necessary changes designed to
eliminate further impairment to the stream. If the Permittee does not
implement the SWPPP changes within a reasonable amount of time, the
operator must file an individual permit with TDEC. To obtain the
individual permit, the operator must file an individual permit application
(EPA 1 &2F). The project must be stabilized immediately until the
SWPPP is updated and the individual permit is issued. Only discharges
from earth disturbing activities necessary for stabilization are authorized
to continue until the individual permit is issued.
(5,) Discharges to Impaired or High Quality Waters
Discharges that would add loadings of a pollutant that is identified as causing or
contributing to an impairment of a water body on the list of impaired waters (303D List)
or which would cause degradation to waters designated by TDEC as high quality waters
are subject to and shall comply with the requirements of the Tennessee Construction
General Permit (TNCGP) currently adopted by the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation (TDEC).
30
(6.) Buffer requirements.
(a) Blue line stream and other bodies of water: Whenever a development or
redevelopment site has a blue line stream or other body of water (pond,
stream, creek, lake) on such site, flowing through such site, or bordering
such site, a buffer of natural and/or man made vegetation shall be
maintained and/or installed which is at least thirty (30) feet in width, as
measured from the top of the bank of such stream or body of water.
Except as may be in conflict with the intent of this ordinance, provisions
of the zoning ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, or other
ordinances and regulations of the city, buffer areas may be occupied by
non-polluting uses and areas such as grassed or landscaped yards, park and
picnic areas, greenways, walking trails, and/or undisturbed native
vegetation. The Stormwater Technician may allow driveway and road
construction to occur through a buffer upon finding that the integrity of the
buffer will not be compromised. Permits for stream crossings may also
require permits from federal, state, and other local agencies.
(b) Whenever a development or redevelopment is adjacent to a stream or has a
stream flowing through the property designated as impaired or high
quality then a buffer zone shall be maintained in accordance with the most
current TNCGP Section 4.4 Discharges into Impaired or High Quality
Waters. An undisturbed vegetative buffer of thirty (30) feet (as measured
from the top-of-bank) shall be maintained adjacent to all free-flowing
waters of the state located including bodies of water such as perennial and
intermittent streams, rivers, ponds and lakes and wetlands. Buffer width
depends on the size of the drainage area. Streams or other waters with
drainage areas less than 1 square mile will require buffer widths of 30ft of
buffer zone. Streams or other waters with drainage areas greater that 1
square mile will require buffer widths of 60ft minimum in all urbanized
areas.
A 60 ft buffer width has been established for sites that contain or are
adjacent to a receiving stream designated as impaired or exceptional
waters. This 60ft buffer can be established on an average width basis at a
project, as long as the minimum width of the buffer is more than 30 ft at
any measured location.
In areas of the jurisdiction, an undisturbed vegetative buffer of thirty (30)
feet can be established on an average basis at a project, as long as the
minimum width of the buffer is no more than fifteen (15) feet at any
measured location.
Vegetated, preferably native, water quality buffers protect water bodies by
providing structural integrity and canopy, as well as storm water
infiltration, filtration and evapotranspiration. Buffer zones are not primary
sediment control measures and should not be relied upon as such.
Every effort should be made of construction activities not to take place
within the buffer and the buffer should remain in its undisturbed state of
vegetation. BMPs providing equivalent protection to a receiving stream as
31
a natural riparian buffer zone may be used at a construction site. Such
BMPs shall be designed to be effective in protecting the receiving water
from effects of stormwater runoff as a natural riparian zone. A justification
for use and a design of equivalent BMPs shall be included in the SWPPP.
Such equivalent BMPs are expected to be routinely used at a construction
project typically located adjacent to surface waters. These projects
include, but ate not limited to: sewer line construction, Roadway
construction, utility line or equipment installation, greenway construction,
construction of a permanent outfall or a velocity dissipating structure, etc.
Enhancements, restoration and re-establishment may be allowed with
proper permit(s).
The Authority may allow a variance to the water quality buffer
requirements. When a variance is allowed by the Authority, mitigation
must be at least as protective of the natural resources and the environment
as the undisturbed buffer. A determination that standards cannot be met
may not be based solely on the difficulty or cost associated with
implementation.
If it is infeasible to provide an undisturbed naturally vegetated buffer of
any size between the disturbed portion of your site and any waters of the
state, sediment and erosion controls certified by a TN licensed
professional engineer to achieve the equivalent sediment load reduction as
an undisturbed naturally vegetated, 30-foot buffer may be implemented on
approval by the Storm Water Appeals Board.
(1) Exception. If pre-existing development on the site has
resulted in significant disturbances within the 30-foot buffer (for
example, sites where all vegetation in the 30-foot buffer area has
been removed and replaced with impervious surfaces as a result of
prior development), you are exempt from complying with the
buffer requirements as long as the area of encroachment is not
extended.
32
Section 5. Post Construction.
1. Landscaping and stabilization requirements.
(a) Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either
partially or wholly cleared by development activities shall be revegetated
according to a schedule approved by the Pigeon Forge Public Works Dept. Storm
Water Technician The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts:
(1) Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established
over ninety percent (90%) of the seeded area.
(2) Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are
capable of controlling erosion.
(3) Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of
seventy-five percent (75%) of the cover crop throughout the year
immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in
successive years until the minimum seventy-five percent (75%) survival
for one (1) year is achieved.
(4) If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control
than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the Authority
may impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to
control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
(5) For projects discharging to waters considered impaired by
sediment or habitat alteration due to in-channel erosion, the SWPPP shall
include a description of measures that will be installed during the
construction process to control pollutants and any increase in the volume
of stormwater discharges that will occur after construction operations have
been completed. For steep slopes sites, the SWPPP shall also include a
description of measures that will be installed to dissipate the volume and
energy of the stormwater runoff to pre-development levels.
(6) Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations
and along the length of any outfall channel to provide a non-erosive
velocity flow from the structure to the receiving stream so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions of the stream are
maintained and protected (e.g., there should be no significant changes in
the hydrological regime of the receiving water). The SWPPP shall include
an explanation of the technical basis used to select the velocity dissipation
devices to control pollution where flows exceed pre-development levels.
The Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook provides
measures that can be incorporated into the design or implemented on site
to decrease erosive velocities. An Aquatic Resources Alteration Permit
(ARAP) may be required if such velocity dissipation devices installed
would alter the receiving stream and- or its bank.
33
(b) In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be
submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and
management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed. This
plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but
who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what
practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved.
2. Runoff Reduction
Site design for all new and redevelopment projects in urbanized areas require, in
combination or alone, management measures that are designed, built and
maintained to infiltrate, evapotranspire, harvest and/or use, at a minimum, the first
inch of every rainfall event preceded by 72 hours of no measureable precipitation.
This first inch of rainfall must be 100% managed with no discharge to surface
waters.
(a) Limitations to the application of runoff reduction requirements include,
but are not limited to:
(1) Where a potential for introducing pollutants into the groundwater
exists, unless pretreatment is provided;
(2) Where pre-existing soil contamination is present in areas subject to
contact with infiltrated runoff;
(3) Presence of sinkholes or karst features;
(b) Pre-development infiltrative capacity of soils at the site must be taken into
account in selection of runoff reduction management measures
(c) Incentive Standards for redeveloped sites: a 10% reduction in the volume
of rainfall to be managed for any of the following types of developments. Such
credits are additive so that a maximum reduction of 50% of the runoff reduction
requirements for a project that meets all 5 criteria:
(1) Redevelopment
(2) Brownfield redevelopment
(3) High density development
(4) Vertical density
(5) Mixed use and transit oriented development (within ½ mi.)
(d) Pollutant Removal - For projects in urbanized areas that cannot meet
100% of the runoff reduction requirement unless subject to the incentive
standards, the remainder of the stipulated amount of rainfall must be treated prior
to discharge with a technology reasonably expected to remove 80% of the total
suspended solids (TSS). The treatment technology must be designed, installed and
maintained to continue to meet this performance standard.
(e) Off-site Mitigation - For projects in urbanized areas that cannot meet
100% of the runoff reduction requirements, the Authority may allow runoff
reduction measures to be implemented at another location within the same USGS
12- digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) as the original project. Off-site mitigation
must be a minimum of 1.5 times the amount of water not managed on site. The
off-site mitigation location (or alternative location outside the HUC 12) and
runoff reduction measures must be approved by the Authority. The Authority
shall identify priority areas within the watershed in which mitigation projects can
34
be completed to the applicant. The Authority will select the mitigation project
from an inventory of appropriate mitigation projects. The project must meet
appropriate institutional standards and provide whatever effort is required to assist
the Authority to value, to evaluate, and track the transaction. Mitigation can be
used for retrofit or redevelopment projects, but should be avoided in areas of new
development.
