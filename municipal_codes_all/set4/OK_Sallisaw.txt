PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Sallisaw, Oklahoma. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1994 Code, as supplemented through January 1, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1994 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. John Robert Montgomery, City Attorney, and the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The City of Sallisaw shall have all powers possible for a City operating under a home-rule charter to have under the Constitution and laws of the State of Oklahoma as fully and completely as though the same were specifically enumerated in this Charter.

If the tower is not removed within 90 days, the bond secured by the tower owner shall be used to remove the tower and any accessory equipment and structures. If the tower has a preexisting tower approval before implementation of these ordinances, and the tower owner has not yet obtained the bond to remove the tower, the tower owner shall be required to remove the tower at their expense. If the tower is not removed within 90 days, the tower owner shall be subject to a fine for each month the tower remains in place, and shall be subject to a mandatory injunction for the removal and the owner shall be responsible for all costs, including attorney's fees, for securing the removal. 
(b)  Bond requirements. When an application is filed to construct a cell tower, the applicant must obtain an estimate to remove the tower from a company acceptable to the City of Sallisaw and experienced in contracting for removal of towers and provide that estimate to the City of Sallisaw along with the application for approval of a special permit to install said tower.

The bond must be provided within 30 days of the date of the approval, but prior to construction beginning. Replacement bonds must be provided 90 days prior to the expiration of any previous bond. At any time, the City of Sallisaw has good cause to question the sufficiency of the bond at the end of any three-year period, the permit holder must provide an updated estimate and bond in the appropriate amount. Failure to keep the bonds in effect is cause for removal of the tower at owner's expense. A separate bond will be required for each cell tower, regardless of the number of owners or the location.

The City of Sallisaw may at any time request the tower owner to perform additional inspections if damaging winds, earthquakes, other natural phenomenon, or unexpected damages occur that may cause structural failure of the cell tower or facilities. If, upon inspection, the tower owner determines that the facility fails to comply with such applicable codes and that such failure constitutes a danger to persons or property, then the owner of the facility must immediately notify the City of Sallisaw. The owner shall have 30 days to bring the facility into compliance with the applicable codes and standards. Failure to bring the facility into compliance within the said 30 days shall constitute cause for the removal of the facility at the owner's expense. 
(b)  Testing. When construction of the tower is first completed and all initial power antenna are installed on the tower, the tower owner shall be required, at their expense, to measure the non-ionizing radiation levels within 30 days to determine if the emissions are within the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidelines for safety regarding uncontrolled exposure to the general public. In order to effectively measure the radiation levels of both directional and omni-directional antenna at cell tower locations, the following measurements are required. 
(1)  For cell towers with only omni-directional antennas, the owners are required to take a minimum of three measurements. The measurements must be taken in a circular pattern at the base of the tower spaced at approximately 120 degree increments. 
(2)  For cell tower locations having directional antennas or a combination of omni-directional and directional antennas, a minimum of six measurements must be taken in a circular pattern at the base of the tower spaced at approximately 60 degree increments with the first measurement taken directly below one of the directional antenna.

(a)  Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances may be such as to justify, and even to require the city manager or other appropriate officer or agency of the city government to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement. 
(b)  The chief of the fire department, the chief of police, the city attorney, the health officer, the building inspector, the electrical inspector, the plumbing inspector, or any other officer subordinate to the city manager or any commissioner or resident may submit, through or with the consent of the city manager to the code enforcement officer, a statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city or law, and a request or recommendation that it be abated. 
(c)  Upon receiving the complaint or observing the nuisance himself, the city manager or his designee will investigate the alleged nuisance. If he determines that a public nuisance exists, he will notify the person responsible for the nuisance. Such notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing, by mail or by service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the names and addresses are not known, and the public peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare would not be unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation within the city. Such notice shall provide not less than ten days nor more than 60 days, at the discretion of the city manager or his designee, in which to abate such nuisance or to request a hearing as set forth in this section. 
(d)  If the person receiving the abatement notice wishes a hearing, he must request it in writing within ten days and mail or file it with the city clerk. The hearing on his request will be before the city manager and will be held as soon as possible after the request is filed. The city manager shall render his decision by written memorandum and file the decision with the city clerk, who shall thereupon mail a copy to the person or persons requesting the hearing at the last known mailing address. 
(e)  If the person responsible for a nuisance wishes to appeal the city manager's decision, he may request a hearing before the board of city commissioners. Such request must be in writing and submitted to the city clerk within five days after notice of the decision of the city manager is mailed to him. 
(f)  The board of city commissioners shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the board of city commissioners shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and other effects. 
(g)  If the board of city commissioners finds that a nuisance does in fact exists, it shall direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate it within the specified time, the board of city commissioners shall direct the city manager to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as authorized by 50 O.S.  16. The city clerk shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if the names and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the city, collectible as other debts of the city may be collected.

Such report shall be itemized as to each tract, as follows: labor, machinery rental or depreciation, fuel and supplies, cost of notice, and other costs. The city manager shall determine the total actual costs of the work, and shall direct the city clerk to forward a statement and demand payment thereof by certified mail with return receipt requested to the owner of the property at the address shown by the current tax rolls in the office of the treasurer of the county in which the property lies. If the statement is not paid within 20 days after such statement is mailed, the board of city commissioners may direct the city attorney to institute action to establish its lien against the property on which such work was done and to request the court to cause such property to be sold and the lien paid.

Such order shall be in writing and may be served personally on the owner or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the health officer or by a police officer, or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual place of abode of the owner, occupant, or agent, if known and within the state. If the premises are unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant, or agent is unknown, or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a copy thereof on the premises, or by publication in at least one issue of a newspaper having a general circulation in the city. 
(b)  If the order is not complied with, the health officer may cause the order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified to the city clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if he is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility service. The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it is added, and shall become due and payable, and be subject to the same regulations relating to delinquency in payment, as the utility bill itself. If such owner or occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost, after certification to the city clerk, may be collected in any manner in which any other debt due the city may be collected.

All generators and transporters will keep their copies of manifests on file for a time period of at least three (3) years. The manifests will be kept in a conspicuous location and will be immediately available to a representative of the city who is performing inspections. 
(Ord. No. 2013-10,  1, 10-14-2013) 
Sec. 38-111. - Cleaning schedule. 
    Grease traps, grease interceptors, oil/water separators and grit traps shall be cleaned as often as necessary to ensure that sedimentation and floating debris does not accumulate to impair the efficiency of the grease trap, grease interceptor, oil/water separator and grit trap, and to ensure that the discharge is in compliance with local discharge limits and no visible grease is observable in the discharge. 
(1)  All grease interceptors/traps shall be serviced and completely pumped of accumulated waste content when the 25 percent rule is reached, or every three months for grease interceptors and monthly for 50 to 100-pound capacity grease traps, whichever first occurs. At any point in time if solidification occurs in the grease interceptor or trap, service needs to be conducted immediately. All devices must be inspected for damages by the transporter every time they are serviced. 
(2)  Grease interceptors and traps shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle in the sludge pocket thereby reducing the effective volume of the device. 
(3)  Oil/water separators and grit traps shall be serviced and completely pumped of accumulated waste content when the 25 percent rule is reached or every six months, whichever first occurs. If a car wash has a water reclamation system in use, the first two to three compartments must be completely pumped of accumulated waste when the 25 percent rule is reached or every six months, whichever first occurs. All of the chambers must be completely emptied and cleaned at least once a year. 
(Ord. No. 2013-10,  1, 10-14-2013) 
Sec. 38-112. - Fees, charges and enforcement. 
(a)  Purpose. It will be the sole purpose of this section to recover any costs incurred by the city from the generators and transporters. 
(1)  Manifest fees. Manifest fees will be established to recover any costs incurred by the city. The manifest fee shall be $50.00 per 100 manifest issued to the hauler. 
(2)  Grease hauler permit fees. The permit fee for each grease hauler permit application approved by the city clerk is $200.00 for the initial permit together with a $50.00 vehicle fee for each vehicle included on the permit. Annual permit renewal fees shall be $100.00 for the permit and a $25.00 vehicle fee for each registered vehicle. 
(b)  Enforcement. 
(1)  Recovery of costs incurred. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article or causing damage to, or otherwise inhibiting, the city's sanitary sewer collection system and/or the POTW shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The cost incurred by the city for any cleaning, repair or replacement work caused by the violation will be added to the person's monthly water bill for payment. Failure or refusal to pay the assessed costs may result in a citation being issued. 
a.  Any facility with or without a grease trap/interceptor causing a bypass due to the facility's discharge of FOG will be liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage incurred. Any facility without a grease trap/interceptor, oil/water separator and/or grit trap will then automatically be required to install, operate and maintain a grease interceptor/trap, oil/water separator and/or grit trap. 
b.  Any facility whose discharge causes a city main to become restricted and require flushing due to FOG, wet wipes and/or paper towels will be liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage incurred. 
(2)  Violations and fines. It shall be unlawful and an offense to violate or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this article. Upon conviction, the penalty shall be a fine of up to $1,000.00, but in no case less than $100.00, plus court costs per day for each day the violation continues.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 46-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma has in 11 O.S.  41-47, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt ordinances designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City of Sallisaw, Oklahoma, ordains the following, to become effective immediately. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter used the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-5. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Accessory structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Examples of accessory structures include, but are not limited to, garages and storage sheds.

    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation means the elevation in feet above mean sea level of the base flood or one percent chance [of] flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    BFE means base flood elevation. 
    CFR means Code of Federal Regulations. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Development permit means a permit issued by the City of Sallisaw Floodplain Administrator which authorizes development in a special flood hazard area in accordance with this chapter. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building built, in the case of a building in zones AE, A, and X, to have the top of the elevated floor adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones AE, A, and X, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 4, 1972. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    FIRM means flood insurance rate map. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map means an official map of the City of Sallisaw on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the city. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by FEMA for City of Sallisaw which contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the floodway width, section area and mean velocity. 
    Floodplain administrator means a person accredited by the OWRB, the city manager, or a person designated by the city manager to administer and implement laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the management of floodplains. 
    Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flood). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations [means] zoning codes and ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose regulations and ordinances, (such as floodplain, grading and erosion control regulations and ordinances), other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within the city subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. A floodway is located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-7. A floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of Title 44 CFR. 
    Manufactured/mobile home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width or 30 body feet or more in length, or, when erected on-site, is 300 or more square feet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities, and includes the plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein. Calculations used to determine the number of square feet in a structure will be based on the structure's exterior dimensions measured at the largest horizontal projections when erected on-site. These dimensions will include all expandable rooms, cabinets, and other projections containing interior space, but do not include bay windows. 
    Manufactured/mobile home subdivision means two or more manufactured/mobile homes on separate lots developed under the provisions of manufactured/mobile homes that are permanently installed for residential use on individually owned lots. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on the city's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the City of Sallisaw City Council and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured/mobile home park means a tract of land under single ownership or control for the purpose of rental or lease upon which two or more manufactured/mobile homes occupy as individual single family dwellings. 
    OWRB means the Oklahoma Water Resources Board. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured/mobile home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance is a grant of relief by the City of Sallisaw Board of Adjustments to a person from the terms of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of Title 44 CFR.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this flood damage prevention ordinance. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-7. - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by FEMA in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for Sequoyah County, Oklahoma and Incorporated Areas" dated September 29, 2010, with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are hereby adopted on September 29, 2010, by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. However, until this date the current effective flood maps for Sequoyah County dated May 4, 1992, shall be used for this purpose until September 29, 2010. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-8. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this floodplain management chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-9. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-10. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and any other ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-11. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-12. - Warning and disclaimer or liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Sallisaw or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(Ord. No. 2010-09,  1, 9-13-2010) 
Sec. 46-16. - Variances. 
(a)  General provisions. 
(1)  The board of appeals may grant variances for uses which do not satisfy the requirements of the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or this chapter, if the applicant for the variance presents adequate proof that (i) compliance with this chapter will result in an arbitrary and unreasonable taking of property without sufficient benefit or advantage to the people and (ii) satisfies the pertinent provisions of this section. However, no variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit the continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards. 
(2)  Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or by other laws of the state. 
(3)  In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than 20 years. 
(4)  Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the board of adjustments, accompanied by a filing fee as designated in the current City of Sallisaw Master Fee Schedule. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half-acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 46-15(b) and provisions of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half-acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(6)  Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the chairman of the board of adjustment or the floodplain administrator which states that (i) the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than the base flood elevation, and (ii) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. 
(7)  At such time as the floodplain administrator deems the petition ready for notification to the public, the board of adjustment or their designee shall schedule a hearing and publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in Sequoyah County in accordance with Oklahoma Title 11. 
(8)  The board of adjustment shall conduct the hearing and make determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section. This appeals group shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted. 
(9)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and 
d.  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(10)  Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the intent of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives stated in section 46-3. 
(11)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any variance issued by the board of adjustment shall be sent by the floodplain administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within 15 days after issuance of the variance. 
(b)  Special provisions. 
(1)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
a.  The criteria of subsection (a)(5); subsection (a)(9); subsection (b)(2); and subsection (b)(3) are met, and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 50-63. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or who believes that he will be irrevocably injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur (hereafter "person aggrieved") may file a complaint with the chief executive officer. Complaints shall be in writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as the chief executive officer requires. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the chief executive officer shall furnish a copy of the complaint to the person or persons who allegedly committed or are about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, or within 30 days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c) of this section, the chief executive officer shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it. If the chief executive officer decides to resolve the complaints, he shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this article without the written consent of the persons concerned. Any employee of the chief executive officer who shall make public any information in violation of this provision shall be, upon conviction, punished as provided in section 1-8. 
(b)  A complaint under subsection (a) of this section shall be filed within 180 days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred.

If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate. 
(e)  In any proceeding brought pursuant to this section, the burden of proof shall be on the complainant.

The chief executive officer may issue subpoenas to compel his access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States District Court for the district in which the investigation is taking place. The chief executive officer may administer oaths. 
(b)  Upon written application to the chief executive officer, a respondent shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the chief executive officer to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent, which subpoenas shall show on their face the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were issued at his request. 
(c)  Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the chief executive officer shall be entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United States District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him. 
(d)  Within five days after services of a subpoena upon any person, such person may petition the chief executive officer to revoke or modify the subpoena.

Such modification thus granted shall be made at the written request of the developer stating the reasons for such modification and shall be waived only by three-fourths vote of the regular membership of the planning commission.

(3)  Cable service shall be available to all residences and businesses within the city on the following terms: whenever the franchisee shall receive a request for service from at least 15 potential subscribers within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to such subscribers for cable system extension, other than the usual connection fees for all subscribers; provided that such extension is technically feasible, or as provided in this section. 
(4)  No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily; however, for unusual circumstances, such as a subscriber's request to locate his cable drop underground, existence of more than 125 feet of distance from distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers, or a density of less than 15 potential subscribers within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the franchisee and subscribers in the area in which service may be expanded, the franchisee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential subscribers within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 15. Subscribers who request service hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The franchisee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance. 
(5)  The franchisee shall provide the city, without charge, channel capacity for public, educational and/or governmental use, as set forth in the franchise agreement.

Section 11.18. 
(8)  The city shall permit only appropriately trained and authorized persons to operate the EAS equipment and shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the franchisee's cable system in any manner that results in inappropriate use thereof, or any loss or damage to the cable system. Except to the extent expressly prohibited by law, the city shall hold the franchisee, its employees, officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of the emergency use of its facilities by the city, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees and costs. 
(9)  The cable system will provide standby power to be installed at locations as determined by franchisee, but shall include backup power at the headend. The power system shall be capable of self-activation at any time there is a loss of commercial power and shall be capable of continuous generation for an undetermined amount of time. 
(10)  When constructing or reconstructing the cable system, the franchisee shall place all cable, appurtenances, and transmission facilities in accordance with the following requirements:

Nothing contained in this section shall require the franchisee to construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals, or other related equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, in the event that the existing or proposed transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are placed underground after the effective date of the franchise, the franchisee shall only be required to construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if it is given reasonable notice. 
b.  Where aerial cable is allowed, franchisee shall not erect any poles along any public way except as may be reasonably necessary to fill small gaps in the existing aerial utility systems and only then with approval of the city, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such poles erected by franchisee shall be removed or modified at the franchisee's expense upon reasonable determination of public convenience. 
(11)  Franchisee shall make no pavement cuts in the installation, maintenance, or removal of its cable system, except upon compliance with this Code.

Sec. 98-75. - Reimbursement of advance payments. 
    The city will make a reimbursement payment to the trustee one time each fiscal year (during the second month of the city's fiscal year) from pro rata charges collected during the preceding fiscal year. The total amount of reimbursement shall never exceed the amount of advance payments paid to the city upon initiation of an extension, nor shall the eligibility to receive reimbursement payments extend for more than seven years from the date the city accepted the water or sanitary sewer line for maintenance. The persons entitled to reimbursements having previously designated a "trustee" shall collect their reimbursement from the trustee who shall receive the reimbursement payment from the city. The trustee shall be responsible to the person entitled thereto for making proper distribution of the moneys; and the trustee shall be the person's agent and representative and the city shall not have, nor incur any liability either for failing to collect the connection charges or failing to pay the amounts to the trustee. The city shall likewise neither have nor incur any liability for any acts or omissions of the trustee. The trustee shall give written receipts to the city for sums received by him on behalf of the person. However, the cancelled warrants or checks of the city purporting to have been endorsed by the trustee shall be conclusive proof of such payment by the city. Following termination of the seven-year reimbursement eligibility period, any person, firm or corporation making use of any water or sanitary sewer line constructed under the provisions of this article shall pay to the city the same pro rata connection charge which is assessable to the project, which shall be deposited in a water and sewer capital improvement account. 
(Code 1994,  12-505) 
Sec. 98-76. - City services outside the corporate limits. 
(a)  Any property adjacent to a city water or sewer line may be permitted to connect thereto upon making application therefor to the city manager and paying the applicable pro rata connection charge as provided in this article, plus a charge as set by the board of commissioners for each single-family residence or single-family residential equivalent served. This latter charge shall represent the cost of plant and main capacity required to accommodate the connection. 
(b)  The city may permit the extension of its water or sanitary sewer lines outside its corporate limits to serve residential, commercial, or industrial property under the same application procedures for extensions inside the city, provided the owner or developer petitions for annexation of the property. The city shall have no obligation to annex the property pursuant to the petition; however, the petition for annexation shall be a prerequisite to the extension of the water or sewer lines. If the city finds that such extension is feasible and capacity exists to properly serve property within and outside the boundaries of the city and approves the plans and specifications submitted, the board of commissioners may permit such extension. The permit shall provide that all lines constructed within the property of the owner or developer shall be at the sole cost and expense of the owner or developer. That portion of the lines constructed off of the property of the owner or developer shall also be paid at the sole cost and expense of the owner or developer. However, at the option of the city, the city may enter into an agreement to provide reimbursement to the owner or developer for connection charges collected by the city from the property that subsequently connects to the off-site extension. The owner or developer shall never receive more than the cost of the off-site extension less than his own pro rata connection charges. The lines so extended shall extend across the entire frontage of the property of the owner or developer. Provided that if adequate water pressure is available, the city shall allow residential service to those adjoining the water lines acquired from Rural Water District Number 1, Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, upon paying the same fees and charges as those served within the city. 
(c)  The regular monthly charge established by ordinance for water or sanitary sewer service will be made to those properties served under the provisions of this article. The city shall have the right to discontinue service to any property failing or refusing to pay when due the charges made by the city for such service by disconnecting the service line of the property from the main to which it is connected, as provided in this chapter. Service to the property may be restored upon payment by the property owner of the delinquent account and any penalties due plus costs for disconnection and reconnection of the service. Each and every resident or owner of property, whether agricultural, residential, commercial or industrial, in receiving services under the provisions of this article, thereby releases the city from any and all cause of action and claim for damage that they might have as a result of the city exercising any right reserved to itself under the provisions of this article.

Sec. 98-222. - Sewer use restrictions. 
(a)  Prohibited discharge standards. 
(1)  General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. The general prohibitions in this section apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(2)  Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater: 
a.  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; 
b.  Wastewater having a pH less than 5.5 or more than 9.5, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment; 
c.  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference but in no case solids greater than one-half inch or 1.27 centimeters in any dimension; 
d.  Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW; 
e.  Wastewater having a temperature greater than 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius); 
f.  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; 
g.  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems; 
h.  Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the superintendent in accordance with section 98-223(d); 
i.  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair; 
j.  Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the city's NPDES permit; 
k.  Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations; 
l.  Stormwater, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the superintendent; 
m.  Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes; 
n.  Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the superintendent in a wastewater discharge permit; 
o.  Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test; 
p.  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; 
q.  Fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in concentrations greater than 100 mg/l; or 
r.  Wastewater causing two readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, of more than the percentage established by the board of commissioners or any single reading over the percentage established by the board of commissioners of the lower explosive limit of the meter. 
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
(b)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR 405-471 are hereby incorporated. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the superintendent shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits established by the board of commissioners for the following substances: 
(1)  Arsenic. 
(2)  Benzene. 
(3)  Beryllium. 
(4)  BOD 5 . 
(5)  Cadmium. 
(6)  Chromium. 
(7)  Copper. 
(8)  Cyanide. 
(9)  Lead. 
(10)  Mercury. 
(11)  Nickel. 
(12)  Oil and grease. 
(13)  Selenium. 
(14)  Silver. 
(15)  Total phenols. 
(16)  Total suspended solids. 
(17)  Zinc. 
The limits in this subsection apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations set out in this subsection. 
(c)  City's right of revision, The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
(d)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
Sec. 98-223. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 98-222(a)(1) or the specific prohibitions in sections 98-222(a)(2)c through (a)(2)r if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section: 
a.  The term "bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  The term "severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  Allowed for maintenance and operation. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. 
(3)  Notice submitted. 
a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Enforcement. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
b.  The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4)a of this section. 
Sec. 98-224. - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
(a)  Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 98-222(a) within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. 
(b)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this division. 
(2)  The superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(3)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the superintendent and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense. 
(4)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(c)  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, the superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The superintendent may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by section 98-227(f); and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(d)  Hauled wastewater. 
(1)  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the superintendent, and at such times as are established by the superintendent. Such waste shall not violate section 98-222 or any other requirements established by the city. The superintendent may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
(2)  The superintendent shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The superintendent may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The superintendent also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this division. 
(3)  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the superintendent. The superintendent may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The superintendent may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
(4)  Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. 
Sec. 98-225. - Pretreatment charges and fees. 
    The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program which may include: 
(1)  Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications; 
(2)  Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
(3)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  Fees for filing appeals; and 
(5)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained in this division. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this division and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the city. 
Sec. 98-226. - Wastewater discharge permit application. 
(a)  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the superintendent, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 30 days of the request. The superintendent is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
(b)  Wastewater discharge permit requirement. 
(1)  No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the superintendent, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein. 
(2)  The superintendent may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this division. 
(3)  Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this division and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in this division. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and local law. 
(c)  Wastewater discharge permitting: existing connections. Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date this division and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall, within 30 days after such date, apply to the superintendent for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 60 days of the effective date of this division except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the superintendent. 
(d)  Wastewater discharge permitting; new connections.

h.  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the superintendent to ensure compliance with this division, and state and federal laws, rules, and regulations. 
(j)  Wastewater discharge permit appeals. 
(1)  The superintendent shall provide public notice of the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit. Any person, including the user, may petition the superintendent to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit within ten days of notice of its issuance. 
(2)  Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal. 
(3)  In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit. 
(4)  The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal. 
(5)  If the superintendent fails to act within 20 days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review. 
(6)  Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so in accordance with law. 
(k)  Wastewater discharge permit modification. The superintendent may modify a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements; 
(2)  To address significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of wastewater discharge permit issuance; 
(3)  A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge; 
(4)  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the city's POTW, city personnel, or the receiving waters; 
(5)  Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge permit;

This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the superintendent, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and longterm average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (j) of this section. 
3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (k) of this section. 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance.

A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection (b) of this section. 
h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 98-226(f). 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (a)(2)g of this section; 
(1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
(2)  No increment referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section shall exceed nine months; 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the superintendent. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the superintendent a report containing the information described in subsections (a)(2)d through (a)(2)f of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's longterm production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 98-226(f). 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the superintendent but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 98-226(f). 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (k) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. 
(1)  Each user must notify the superintendent of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before the change. 
(2)  The superintendent may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 98-226(e). 
(3)  The superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 98-226(g) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 98-226(k) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(4)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the superintendent as the superintendent may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the superintendent monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the superintendent samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. The following provisions apply only if the discharge of hazardous waste is not prohibited. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e) of this section. The notification requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (a), (c) and (d) of this section. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (i)(1) of this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 40 CFR 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the superintendent, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (k)(2) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(l)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the superintendent. 
Sec. 98-228. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Right of entry for inspection and sampling. 
(1)  The superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this ordinance and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(2)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(3)  The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(4)  The superintendent may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated frequency established by the board of commissioners to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued under this division, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant. 
Sec. 98-229. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the superintendent, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined in 40 CFR 2.302, will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
Sec. 98-230. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation that the superintendent believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the superintendent's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation which the superintendent determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
Sec. 98-231. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative fines. 
(1)  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty determined by the board of commissioners and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate determined by the board of commissioners per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(3)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. If the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(4)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. 
(1)  The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(2)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user. 
(3)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection (c) or (h) of this section. 
(4)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in section 28-226(m), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 98-222. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
Sec. 98-232. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may petition the courts through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of the user. The superintendent may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other longterm average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
Sec. 98-233. - Criminal prosecution. 
(a)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. 
(b)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(c)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this division, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. 
Sec. 98-234. - Remedies nonexclusive. 
    The remedies provided for in this division are not exclusive. The superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the superintendent may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the superintendent is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

(b)  The city manager may, at his discretion, require any apartment building or complex or trailer park to use the commercial container system for collecting garbage or trash. Nevertheless, it is the intention of the board of commissioners that a monthly charge as set by the board of commissioners be made on every residential dwelling unit, be it a single-family dwelling, duplex, triplex, apartment or trailer, and such charge shall prevail in the case of residential units rather than the charges hereinafter provided for the commercial container system service. 
(c)  Public, business and commercial institutions shall be designated to receive commercial sanitation container system service for the removal of garbage and trash under the rates and rules hereinafter set forth. Under the commercial sanitation system service, the city will furnish a container or containers to be used in the collection and removal of garbage and trash.
