PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Warwick, Rhode Island. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1971 Code, as supplemented through October 18, 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1971 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Marie Bennett, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Secs. 2.5-2.7. - Reserved.

    The proceeds arising from the sale of any bonds or notes issued under authority of this act shall be delivered to the city treasurer and shall be kept in separate accounts and shall be expended only for the purposes, and in the manner, prescribed by this act; provided that the proceeds of the sale of any issue of serial bonds or notes shall first be applied to the payment of such temporary notes as may have been issued in anticipation of such issue; and provided, further, that any premium received over the par value of the serial bonds or notes of any issue, less the cost of preparing, issuing, and marketing such serial bonds or notes shall be applied to the payment of the principal of the first bonds or notes of such issue first to mature. 
(P.L. 1962, ch. 254, § 8; P.L. 2016, ch. 061, § 1) 
Sec. 2.9. - Apportionment of costs; sewer assessments and charges; enforcement of charges and assessments. 
    The authority, with the advice and consent of the mayor, shall prescribe just and equitable sewer assessment rates on account of the construction costs and the cost of principal and interest for any bonds or notes issued for sewage works, to be levied against owners of parcels abutting on that portion of any highway in which a common sewer is laid under this act and also rates of user charges on account of operation and maintenance costs and renewal and replacement funding and the cost of principal and interest for any bonds or notes issued for sewage works, to be levied against owners of parcels which are connected to a common sewer or in accordance with section 17(b). 
    Such assessments herein referred shall be paid by every parcel owner whose parcel abuts on that portion of any highway in which a common sewer is laid, under this act, in a manner prescribed by the authority, with the approval of the mayor and the finance director. Such annual user charges herein referred shall be paid by every parcel owner whose parcel is connected to a common sewer, or in accordance with section 17(b), in a manner prescribed by the authority, with the approval of the mayor and the finance director. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority may defer sewer assessments against parcels that are undeveloped or not developed to the extent permissible by city zoning ordinances; provided, that such parcels remain subject to assessment upon the development or redevelopment of such parcels in accordance with the authority's rules and regulations. The authority may defer sewer assessments against any parcels if the owner of a parcel has installed a new OWTS within twenty (20) years of sewer service initially becoming operational: provided that such parcel shall remain subject to assessment and shall begin paying such assessment twenty (20) years from the date of the installation of the OWTS, or upon connection to the sewer system, whichever occurs first. 
    The sewer assessments shall be determined by a method(s) adopted by the sewer authority that assesses charges for use of the sewers and the sewer systems in an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the cost of construction to the city and authority of the service rendered to the users, which method(s) may include, but is not limited to, the frontage along the highway of each parcel of land abutting on a common sewer; the area of such land within a fixed depth from the highway; or other alternative methods. The sewer authority, with the advice and consent of the mayor, may, from time to time, redetermine the rates fixed for sewer assessments, if construction costs warrant, and may redetermine rates for user charges, if costs so warrant. 
    The sewer assessments herein referred to shall be paid by every parcel owner whose parcel is abutting on that portion of any highway in which a common sewer is laid under this act or is connected to the city's sewage works. 
    Sewer assessments levied hereunder may be paid in as many as thirty (30) annual installments in accordance with the terms of the loan secured for sewer construction, upon application by the parcel owner and approval of the sewer authority. In the case of installment payments, interest at a rate not to exceed a maximum rate of one and twenty-five hundredths percent (1.25%) above the average interest rate the authority is charged on the loan used to fund the construction of the sewers shall be charged annually on the unpaid balance of the total sewer assessment. Such annual installment payments may be paid on a quarterly basis. 
    Sewer assessments shall be levied at a uniform rate based upon the final cost of constructing all sewers, sewer service connections, and other sewage works belonging to the city. Sewer assessment revenues shall be used for the payment of the principal and interest costs for any bonds or notes issued for sewage works. 
    User charges shall be levied upon every parcel owner or institution whose parcel is connected to the city's sewage system. The charge shall be computed as annual rates based upon water consumption or other factors deemed equitable by the sewer authority. The user charge shall be set at a level sufficient to support operation and maintenance costs of the sewer system and the wastewater treatment plant, the renewal and replacement fund and the principal and interest for any bonds or notes issued for sewage works. The revenues to be raised by user charges will be reduced by revenues generated by sewer assessments. 
    The authority shall annually certify, to the finance director and to the mayor, all the charges and sewer assessments made by it under the authority of this act. Each charge or assessment made by the authority pursuant to this act shall be a lien upon the parcels, lands, buildings, and improvements upon which it is made in the same way and manner as taxes assessed on real estate, but such liens shall not expire until the charge or assessment, with all interest, costs, and penalties thereon, is paid in full, and, if the charge or assessment is not paid as required, it shall be collected in the same manner that taxes assessed on real estate are by law collected. The finance director, after receiving a list of charges or assessments under this act, shall forthwith, at the expense of the authority, send to each person assessed or charged notice of the amount of his assessment or charge. The notice shall substantially identify the person assessed, state the amount of the assessment or charge, and refer to the remedy available under section 19 of this act The notice shall be mailed postpaid and directed to the last known address of the person assessed. If there are persons whose addresses are unknown, a similar notice covering the assessments against such persons shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and such published notice may be a single collective notice for all such persons. No irregularity in the notice required by this section shall excuse the nonpayment of the assessment or charge or affect its validity or any proceedings for the collection thereof as long as there is substantial compliance with the provision hereof. No deficiency in the notice to the person assessed shall excuse the nonpayment by others of the assessment or charges assessed against them or affect the validity thereof or any proceedings for the collection thereof. The finance director shall, without further warrant, collect such charges and assessments in the same manner as the regular taxes of the city may be payable. Interest at the rate per annum fixed for nonpayment of city taxes shall be charged and collected upon all overdue charges and assessments from the date they become payable until paid; provided, however, that the total overdue charge for nonpayment of installment of sewer assessments shall be applied to past-due installments and not the total assessment; and provided, further, that there shall be no penalty on installment assessments deferred by reason of income subject to rules and regulations that the Warwick city council may prescribe by ordinance. 
    The authority, with the advice and consent of the mayor, may at any time modify, in whole or in part, any charge or assessment to the extent the authority determines such charge or assessment to have been improperly imposed. 
(P.L. 1962, ch. 254, § 9; P.L. 1988, ch. 479, § 9; P.L. 1991, ch. 86, § 9; P.L. 1998, ch. 39, § 1(9); P.L. 2016, ch. 061, § 1) 
Sec. 2.9.1. - Renewal and replacement account. 
    The city finance director shall establish in a separate account for renewal and replacement. The purpose of the account is to provide for the future renewal or replacement of the current and future physical assets of the wastewater treatment plant whose cost is in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.) with an economic life of at least five (5) years. The renewal and replacement account will be funded annually through user charges, as determined by the sewer authority, in an amount equal to total gross depreciation expense as computed under generally accepted accounting principles, including the amortization of local and nonlocal contributed capital, or an alternative amount based on industry standards. Interest earned on monies deposited in the renewal and replacement fund will be credited to the account. Withdrawals from the account, subject to the aforementioned limitations of cost and economic life, must be approved by the sewer authority. 
(P.L. 1988, ch. 479, § 9.1; P.L. 2016, ch. 061, § 1) 
Sec. 2.10. - Receipts from user charges and assessments. 
    The receipts from user charges and sewer assessments, as provided for in section 9 of this act, should be separately accounted for by the finance director, at the close of each fiscal year the city treasurer shall transfer from such funds to the treasury a sum sufficient to repay the sums appropriated and paid from the treasury during the fiscal year then close on account of the principal and interest of all borrowing for the purpose of this act and for the payment of charges and expenses incident to the operation, maintenance, renewal and replacement fund and repair of said sewage works or to the extension thereof. At the end of a fiscal year, if the finance director determines that the revenues referred to above, as well as prior year fund balances, were not sufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs, renewal and replacement funding, and principal and interest for any bonds or notes issued for sewage works, thereby creating insufficient end-of-year balances, charge shall be adjusted in the next fiscal year to assure sufficient balances in the sewer fund. If the receipts from said charges and assessments amount in any year to more than will be required for the aforesaid purposes, the surplus shall be added to the receipts of the next succeeding year. 
(P.L. 1962, ch. 254, § 10; P.L. 1988, ch. 479, § 10; P.L. 1998, ch. 39, § 1 (10); P.L. 2016, ch. 061, § 1) 
Sec. 2.11. - Recovery of assessment charge by joint, tenant, tenant in common, etc., and the like, from other tenant. 
    Whenever a tenant by the entirety, or a joint tenant, or a tenant in common of any parcel subject to a sewer charge or assessment under this act, shall pay the whole amount of such sewer charge or assessment, such tenant may recover from the other joint tenant, or tenant in common as the case may be, such proportional part of such charge or assessment as the value of the latter's interest in the parcel bears to the aggregate value of such parcel, by proceedings in the superior court for the county of Kent in the nature of an action of account as provided in § 10-2-1 et seq., and in any acts in amendment thereof or in addition thereto, and such action is hereby made available for the purposes of this section. The same shall apply as between a tenant for life or years and the owner of the fee with respect to construction assessments. Whenever the owner of the fee shall pay a user charge, such owner may recover the amount so paid from the tenant in a similar action to the extent is attributable to the period of the tenancy. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to impair any other right of action which the party paying such charge or assessment may have at law or in equity to secure a contribution from the other parties having an interest in the parcel subject to such charge or assessment.

    The sewer authority, with the advice and consent of the mayor on behalf of the city, may acquire by agreement, purchase, or condemnation such land or right or easement in land as may be necessary for the purposes of this act. Whenever the authority desires to take any such land or right or easement in land by condemnation, it shall file with the city clerk a plat, description, and statement of such land or right or easement in land to be taken and a statement that such land or right or easement in land is taken pursuant to the provisions of this act. 
    Upon the recording of said plat, description, and statement in the office of the city clerk, the land or right or easement in land defined in such plat, description, and statement to the extent and according to the nature of the interest therein taken, shall vest in the city and shall be subject to the use of the authority for the purposes of this act, and said authority may thereupon enter upon and enjoy the rights, interests, and easements taken as aforesaid; and after the filing of such plat, description, and statement, notice of such taking shall be served upon the owners of and persons having an estate in and interested in such land by any police officer of the city of Warwick leaving a true and attested copy of such description and statement with each of such persons personally, or at their land and usual place of abode in this state with some person living there, and, in case any of such persons are absent from the state and have no land and usual place of abode therein occupied by any person, such copy shall be left with the persons, if any, in charge of, or having possession of, such land of such absent persons, and another copy thereof shall be mailed to the address of such absent persons if the same is known to said officer; and after the filing of such description and statement, the city clerk of said city shall cause a copy of such description and statement to be published in some newspaper or newspapers published or circulated in said city at least twice a week for three successive weeks; and if any party shall agree with said authority for the price of the rights, interests, or easement so taken, the same shall be paid to him forthwith by said authority. 
    The authority, with the advice and consent of the mayor, shall have general authority to represent the city and to make any agreements for said city under the authority of this section and to do, with the advice and consent of the mayor, any acts or things necessary or incidental to executing settlements and agreements, and shall have authority to agree with the owner for the price of land so taken and the same shall be paid by the city treasurer out of the proceeds of bonds or notes issued hereunder or other funds made available for the purpose, upon vouchers approved by the authority and the finance director. 
    Any owner of or person entitled to any estate in, or interested in, any part of the land in which such fee, rights, interests or easements are so taken who cannot agree with said city or authority for the price of such fee, rights, interests, or easements so taken in which he/she is interested as aforesaid, may, within one year from the filing of the plat, description, and statement referred to in this section of this act, apply by petition to the superior court in and for the county of Kent, setting forth the taking of such fee, rights, interests, or easements in his land and praying for an assessment of damages by a jury. Upon the filing of said petition, the said court shall cause twenty (20) days' notice of the pendency thereof, to be given to said city by serving the mayor of said city with a certified copy thereof, and may proceed after such notice to the trial thereof; and such trial shall determine all questions of fact relating to the value of such fee, rights, interests or easements and the amount thereof, and judgment shall be entered upon the verdict of such jury and execution shall be issued therefor. 
    In case any owner of or person having an estate in or interested in such land shall fail to receive personal notice of the taking as aforesaid, and shall fail to file the petition as provided in this section, said court in its discretion may permit the filing of such petition subsequent to said period of one year from the filing of such description and statement; provided, such person shall have no actual knowledge of the taking of such fee, right, interest, or easement in season to file such petition. 
    If any lands, or any fee, rights, interests, or easements therein, in which any infant or other person not capable in law to act in his own behalf is interested, are taken by said authority under the provisions of this act, said superior court, upon the filing therein of any such petition by or in behalf of such infant or other person, may appoint a guardian ad litem for such infant or other person, and such guardian may appear and be heard in behalf of such infant or other person; and such guardian may also, with the advice and consent of said superior court, may prescribe, release to said city or authority all claims for damages for the fee, rights, interests, or easements in the lands of such infant or other person. Any lawfully appointed, qualified, and acting guardian of the estate of any such infant or other person, with the approval of the court of probate within this state having jurisdiction to authorize the sale of lands within this state of any such infant or person, may, before the filing of any such petition, agree with said authority upon the amount of damages suffered by such infant or other person by any such taking and may, upon receiving such amount, release to said city or authority all claims of damages of such infant or other person for such taking. 
    Any damages assessed as the result of petition to the superior court shall be paid by the city treasurer from the proceeds of bonds or notes issued hereunder or other funds made available for the purpose upon vouchers approved by the mayor and the authority and finance director; provided, however, that nothing in this act shall authorize the authority to condemn any portion of the land or right-of-way of any railroad, street, railway, or other public service company, except for the purpose of crossing the same below grade and of building and maintaining necessary manholes at such crossing in such manner as not to render unsafe, or to impair the usefulness of such land or right-of-way for railroad or street railway purposes or the purposes of such other public service company. If said authority and such railroad, street, railway, or other public service company are unable to agree as to the method of the construction and maintenance of such sewer and manholes at any such crossing, either party may apply to the division of public utilities for a determination thereof, and, after hearing, such sewer and manholes shall be constructed and maintained in such method and manner as may be ordered by said division. Either party aggrieved by such order of said division may appeal to the supreme court. 
    Prior to any taking hereunder, the authority shall provide specific funds for payment of compensation, the use of such funds for such purpose shall be a fixed obligation of the city, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the full faith and credit of the city shall be deemed pledged to pay such compensation.

(a)  The sewer authority, with the advice and consent of the mayor, in the interest of public health and safety is authorized to order any abutting owner or occupant of any parcel whereupon there is a cesspool, privy vault, OWTS, drain, or other arrangement that has failed by the Rhode Island department of environmental management definition upon any street in which there is a sewer, or in which a sewer may hereafter be constructed, to connect the sewage of such premises with such sewer, and to order any owner or occupant to fill up and destroy any cesspool, privy vault, drain, or other arrangement on such parcel for the reception of sewage. Upon the service of any such order, or copy thereof, upon any such owner or occupant, to connect the sewage as aforesaid, or to fill up or destroy any cesspool, privy vault, drain, or other arrangement for the reception of sewage, such owner or occupant shall comply therewith within thirty (30) days from the time of service of such order.

The pendency of any appeal from any such order shall not affect the power of the authority, after the expiration of said period of sixty (60) days, to cause such cesspool, privy vault, or other arrangement for the reception of sewage to be forthwith filled up and destroyed. 
    Whenever the authority shall cause any cesspool, privy vault, or other arrangement for the reception of sewage to be filled up and destroyed, or the sewage of any parcel to be connected with a common sewer, it shall keep careful account of the cost of such work and of any expense caused the city or authority by reason of the neglect or refusal of the owner or occupant of such parcel to comply with the order of the authority issued as aforesaid, and upon the completion of such work, the authority shall file statement of such cost and expense with the director of finance and thereupon the amount of such cost and expense shall be a lien upon the parcel, including improvements thereon, for which such cost and expense was incurred and the same shall be collected in the same manner as other assessments and charges are collected under this act. 
(b)  Any owner of any parcel upon any street in which there is a sewer must connect the sewage of such premises with such sewer and fill up and destroy any cesspool, privy vault, drain, or other arrangement on such parcel for the reception of sewage, excluding any Rhode Island department of environmental management OWTS approved system, prior to the one year anniversary of the sale or transfer in ownership. If such abutting owner or occupant of any parcel who is required to connect to the sewage system fails to do so in the prescribed time period, then such abutting owner or occupant of the parcel shall be required to pay usage fees as if such abutting owner or occupant of the parcel were connected to the sewage system. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, regulation, or agreement to the contrary, an abutting owner or occupant of any parcel upon any street in which there is a common sewer shall not be required to connect to the sewage system, except as provided under subsections (a) or (b) of this section.

CHAPTER 3. - WATER DEPARTMENT[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- The water department traces its origin to P.L. 1927, ch 1121, "An Act Providing for a Water Supply in the Town of Warwick." That chapter was amended by P.L. 1931, ch. 1852, "An Act to Establish the City of Warwick." 

Sec. 3.1. - Water supply board generally. 
    There is hereby established for the town of Warwick a water supply board, consisting of five members all of whom shall be qualified electors of said town. The board of water commissioners, appointed by the moderator at the annual financial town meeting of said town held on May 12, 1925, pursuant to resolutions adopted by said town meeting, is hereby continued in office until the members of said water supply board are elected as hereinafter provided. 
    The members of said water supply board shall be elected by the electors of the town of Warwick qualified to vote for general officers, at the special election to be called and held in said town in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of this act, and shall hold office from the date of their election until their duties relative to the construction of a water supply system are completed. 
    A person holding any other town office or representing said town as a senator or representative in the general assembly shall not be eligible for membership on said board and whenever any member of said board shall be elected to any other town office or shall be chosen as a senator or representative in the general assembly or shall cease to be a qualified elector of said town his membership on said board shall cease and determine. The town council of said town may by a majority vote remove any member of said board because of misconduct or incapacity on the part of such member in the discharge of his duties and said town council shall fill any vacancy occurring in the membership of said board from any cause, by the appointment of a properly qualified elector as a member to fill such vacancy. The members of said board shall serve without pay, but they may elect one of their number as secretary and fix his salary, which shall be paid in the same manner as other lawful obligations incurred by said board. 
    The board may adopt by-laws and rules regulating the transaction of its business but no by-laws shall authorize any action by the board except by majority vote thereof. The board from time to time may employ and fix the compensation of such attorneys, engineers, surveyors, draftsmen, clerks and other employees as may be necessary for the efficient performance of its duties hereunder, and may at any time discontinue the employment of any or all such employees. The board shall cause to be kept in books of the town a record of all its acts and proceedings and an accurate account of all its financial transactions and shall annually in the month of April report to the town council its doings and a summary at least of its financial accounts. The board shall be vested with the exclusive power and authority to construct a system of waterworks for said town, and to provide an adequate water supply for said town, and for said purposes is hereby authorized and empowered to make for and in behalf of said town all necessary contracts with the owners of privately owned water systems, quasi-municipal water companies and other municipalities, for the purchase or lease of their property and equipment and for the purchase of water to be distributed throughout said town or any portion thereof, and especially to contract for and in behalf of said town with the city of Providence and to act for and in behalf of said town in all matters relating thereto as are provided in P.L. 1915, ch. 1278, § 18, and all acts in amendment thereof and addition thereto. Before said board shall acquire by purchase or condemnation, or both, the necessary property for such water supply system, or before said board shall make contracts with the city of Providence, or with any other municipality, person or corporation for a supply of water, said board shall prepare a plan or plans for the construction of said waterworks and the acquisition of a water supply and shall submit such plan or plans to the town council, and after the same shall have been approved by said council, said board shall proceed as soon as may be to execute such plan or plans. All work and materials required for such construction, or any other construction authorized or required under this act shall be procured by contract made pursuant to and in [the] manner required by the provisions hereof.

(a)  The city council finds and determines that: 
(1)  An unacceptable number of healthy but abandoned cats are euthanized annually in Rhode Island.

(4)  A license system for breeding of cats owned or harbored in the City of Warwick combined with a program for spaying/neutering is a reasonable and effective means of reducing the population of abandoned or stray cats, and for eliminating the practice of euthanizing homeless cats except those for whom euthanasia is an escape from suffering or necessary to protect people and/or other animals from vicious behavior. 
(b)  Declaration of intent. The city council hereby finds and declares that it intends to provide for the public health, safety and welfare through a program requiring spaying and neutering cats unless appropriate licenses are acquired.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 6-71. - Establishment of regulations pertaining to removal of illegally parked vehicles. 
    The board of public safety may make further rules and regulations not inconsistent with chapter 76 to implement the provisions of section 76-7 et seq. 
(Code 1971, § 22-12) 
Sec. 6-72. - Permits: concealed carry weapons. 
(a)  Preamble: G.L. § 11-47-11 establishes the standards for local municipalities to issue concealed carry weapons (CCW) permits; and as qualified applicants are law-abiding citizens trained and certified in the use of firearms they must be treated with dignity and respect as they engage in the legal right to seek said permit; while the board of public safety has the power to regulate the issuance of CCW permits for the City of Warwick, it is critical to ensure procedures and standards are not imposed in an overly broad, or arbitrary manner. Warwick residents and business owners who meet the criteria set forth by the State of RI must be ensured a timely, fair, predictable and consistent process to apply for a CCW permit through our municipal licensing authority; in an effort to promote transparency in government, avoid any misunderstandings, and protect applicants' right to due process, applicants who are denied a CCW permit must be notified of the reason(s) for disapproval in a timely, written manner; and the Warwick City Council is adamant that CCW permits processed by the board of public safety be issued in strict compliance with G.L. § 11-47-11. 
(b)  The Warwick Board of Public Safety shall adhere to the following procedures in considering the application and issuance of CCW permits: 
1.  The Warwick Board of Public Safety (a.k.a. "the board"), as the licensing authority for the City of Warwick is charged with issuing concealed carry weapons (CCW) permits. Individuals must be 21 years of age or older to apply for a CCW permit and meet the following criteria: 
a.  Have a bona fide residence or place of business within the City of Warwick verified by either the Warwick Board of Canvassers, Warwick Department of Taxation or the Warwick Chief of Police, or 
b.  Have a bona fide residence within the United States and a license or permit to carry a pistol or revolver concealed upon his or her person issued by the authorities of any other state or subdivision of the United States. 
c.  The board will consider business, employment and personal factors when reviewing "good reasons" and "proper reasons" to determine if a CCW permit is to be issued. 
2.  Per G.L. § 11-47-11, the board shall issue a permit to an applicant to carry a pistol or revolver concealed upon his/her person everywhere within this state for four years from date of issue. This permit shall not contain any restrictions, however state and federal law shall still apply. The permit shall be issued to the applicant if: 
a.  It appears that the applicant has good reason to fear an injury to his or her person or property; 
b.  The applicant has any other proper reason for carrying a pistol or revolver; 
c.  He or she is a suitable person to be so licensed; 
d.  The applicant must demonstrate competence, familiarity and proficiency with a handgun by completing a certified NRA firearms safety course or its equivalent of at least four hours, which includes classroom and range time. 
(1)  The firearms safety course must be completed within three years prior to the initial permit. CCW permit renewals will only require recertification on the range, as indicated by the CCW permit application. 
(2)  A list of certified firearms safety courses is included in the CCW permit application. 
3.  An applicant is not required to present a "purpose" or "need" beyond what is called for in G.L. § 11-47-11. For the purpose of applications to the board under G.L. § 11-47-11 "Self-defense" based upon previous threats/threatening conduct within the prior six months documented by a police report or written complaint is a "good" or "proper reason. No line of questioning by the board during the interview process will call for speculation as to how the applicant may alter his or her actions to negate the request/ need for a CCW permit. The following may be considered when the board determines a "good" or "proper reason. 
a.  Conditions of employment or business necessity, whether required or preferred, are considered "proper reason" for issuing a CCW permit. The nature of an applicant's work may warrant a "good reason" for a CCW permit to be approved. Examples include but are not limited to: amount of money carried, lateness of the hour, past instances of crime, the surrounding neighborhood and other dangerous circumstances. 
Requesting a reciprocal CCW permit by the City of Warwick when a CCW permit. has been issued by the Rhode Island Attorney General is a "proper reason." Possession of a current federal firearms license is a factor in consideration of the application for the CCW permit. 
c.  Suitability of the applicant may also be a consideration when issuing a permit. Decisions must be based on evidence provided by the application process and not merely conjecture. The board must articulate a specific and justifiable reason to find someone unsuitable. 
4.  The board will review the completed application along with three letters of reference and a background criminal investigation (BCI) within 60 calendar days of receipt. Letters of reference shall only be required for new, not renewal, permit applications. Applicants are required to appear before the board for a personal interview. A hearing with written or recorded minutes must be held for the applicant. The specific reason(s) for denying a CCW permit must be provided in writing by registered mail within ten business days of conducting the interview or the permit shall be automatically issued. 
a.  Applicants may request reconsideration in the case of a CCW permit denial by the board. Furthermore, said applicants have the right to judicial review under G.L. § 42-35-15, RI Administrative Procedures. 
5.  Legitimate reasons for an applicant to be deemed unsuitable to be licensed include: 
a.  Be ineligible to possess a firearm by virtue of having been convicted of a felony. 
b.  Have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a misdemeanor under Rhode Island General Laws or similar laws of any other state relating to a controlled dangerous substance within a five-year period immediately preceding the date on which the application is submitted. 
c.  Found guilty of, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to operating a vehicle while intoxicated within the five-year period immediately preceding the date on which the application is submitted, or at any time after the application has been submitted. 
d.  Entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to or been found guilty of a crime of violence, as defined by G.L. §§ 11-47-2(2), 11-47-5(a), including domestic abuse, at the misdemeanor level, unless five years have elapsed since completion of sentence or any other conditions set by the court have been fulfilled, or unless the conviction was set aside and the prosecution dismissed, prior to the date on which the application is submitted. 
(1)  Prohibition also applies to any person sentenced to community confinement or electronic surveillance in accordance with G.L. § 11-47-5(c). 
e.  Been convicted of, have entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, or be charged under indictment or a bill of information for any crime of violence or any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of one year or greater. 
f.  Is a fugitive from justice. 
g.  Released from active or reserve duty from the Armed Forces of the United States with a discharge characterized as "bad conduct discharge", or a "dishonorable discharge". In the case of Commissioned Officers and Warrant Officers of the United States Armed Forces, the punishment of "dismissal" rendered subject to a verdict of "guilty" at a trial by military court-martial is deemed to be disqualifying under this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, the United States Coast Guard is considered an Armed Force. 
i.  Be ineligible to possess or receive a firearm under 18 U.S.C. 922(g). 
j.  Had a permit revoked by the board within four years prior to the most recent application. 
k.  Been denied a pistol permit in a jurisdiction other than the City of Warwick based on suitability grounds within four years prior to the most recent application. 
l.  Adjudged mentally incompetent at the time of application or for five years prior to application as defined in G.L. § 40.1-5.3-3 or a comparable procedure located in another state following a hearing at which the applicant/defendant was represented by counsel or a representative. 
6.  Notwithstanding any other chapter or section of the general laws of the state of Rhode Island, the board shall not provide or release to any individual, firm, association or corporation the name, address, or date of birth of any person who has held or currently holds a license or permit to carry a concealed pistol or revolver. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the release of any statistical data of a general nature relative to age, gender and racial or ethnic background nor shall it be construed to prevent the release of information to parties involved in any prosecution of § 11-47-8 or in response to a lawful subpoena in any criminal or civil action which the person is a party to that action. 
a.  While completing their duties and responsibilities in exercising their authority to issue or deny CCW permits in compliance with federal, state and local law, the board of public safety is acting under sovereign immunity. 
7.  Warwick Ordinance § 40-1(19) disorderly conduct is the prevailing law for those individuals issued a CCW permit unless circumstances necessitates the gun owner to no longer keep his or her weapon concealed. Brandishing, improper exhibition or unlawful display is not permissible. Unintended viewing of the weapon as a nondeliberate act is not actionable.

Sec. 6-440. - Statement of purpose. 
    The city desires to be a good neighbor with the T.F. Green State Airport in promoting its economic vitality, and in promoting the use and enjoyment of said airport for our citizens. 
    At the same time, the city recognizes the adverse impact that the expansion of T.F. Green Airport has had to our surrounding neighborhoods. The city further recognizes that this problem is significant and has far reaching implications including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  It adversely impacts the health, safety and welfare of the residents surrounding the airport; 
(2)  It reduces the fair market value of homes in the city; 
(3)  Vital tax dollars are lost in perpetuity to the city when homes and land are purchased by the state airport corporation, which is a tax exempt entity; 
(4)  The haphazard purchase of property around T.F. Green based on noise contour lines creates an inefficient land-use pattern in and around the airport; 
(5)  It threatens our economic vitality by placing an increased tax burden on the remaining commercial and residential property owners; 
(6)  It destroys the intrinsic visual beauty of the landscape; and 
(7)  It increases traffic, increases noise and air pollution, creates safety concerns, and leads to deteriorating roadways. 
    Therefore, it is clear that in order to protect the quality of life around T.F. Green Airport, city officials must work to develop effective mechanisms to control airport expansion in and around T.F. Green Airport.

    The commission will also consider initiatives that will enable the city to lay a realistic foundation for sustainable growth of T.F. Green Airport while protecting the quality of life for residents of the city. These initiatives should include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Promoting greater citizen involvement in the planning process around the airport; 
(2)  Examining initiatives for alleviating noise and air pollution for neighborhoods surrounding the airport; 
(3)  If neighborhoods so desire, assisting them in marketing their land as a whole in order to increase the fair market value of their individual properties which may include assistance with comprehensive plan amendments and/or zone changes; 
(4)  Examining the city's infrastructure capacity and setting guidelines for future expansion of T.F. Green Airport, including the development of noise compatibility overlay zones; 
(5)  Promoting an active approach to the acquisition of land for open space and recreation to act as buffer zones between the airport and residential neighborhoods, and 
(6)  To work with neighborhood residents, whose properties are being bought out and RIAC to address the following concerns: 
a.  Establishing a written time table which residents can rely upon to determine when individual homes will be purchased; 
b.  Providing the residents with information as to how the fair market value of their homes and property will be determined; and 
c.  Providing residents with an informational booklet as to their rights and responsibilities pursuant to the buyout program.

The FIRM and FIS report and any revisions thereto are incorporated herein by reference and are on file with the department of city planning. 
(b)  Administrative provisions. 
Building permit. All proposed construction or other development within a special flood hazard area shall require a permit. 
The National Flood Insurance Program Special Flood Hazard Area requires permits for all projects that meet the definition of development, not just "building" projects. Development projects include any filling, grading, excavation, mining, drilling, storage of materials, temporary stream crossings. If the construction or other development within a special flood hazard area is not covered by a building permit, all other non-structural activities shall be permitted by either the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council and/or the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management as applicable. Therefore if another state agency issues a permit, the local building official must have the opportunity for input and keep a copy of the respective permit in their files. 
Prior to the issuance of a building or development permit, the applicant shall submit evidence that all necessary permits and approvals have been received from all government agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law. 
A permit fee (based on the cost of the construction) may be required to be paid to the City of Warwick and a copy of a receipt for the same shall accompany the application. An additional fee may be charged if the code enforcement officer and/or board of appeals needs the assistance of a professional engineer. 
Disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by the ordinance is considered reasonable but does not imply total flood protection. 
Severability. If any section, provision, or portion of this section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court, the remainder of the ordinance shall not be affected. 
Abrogation and greater restriction. This section shall not in any way impair/remove the necessity of compliance with any other applicable laws, ordinances, regulations, etc. Where this section imposes a greater restriction, the provisions of this section shall control. 
Enforcement. The building official shall enforce all provisions as applicable in reference to G.L. § 23-27.3-108.1. 
Penalties. Every person who shall violate any provision of this Code shall be subject to penalties put forth in G.L. § 23-27.3-122.3. 
(3)  Notification of watercourse alteration. In a riverine situation, the office of the building official shall notify the following of any alteration or relocation of a watercourse:

    Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    Manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision. A parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value. Market value is the price of a structure that a willing buyer and seller agree upon. This can be determined by an independent appraisal by a professional appraiser; the property's tax assessment, minus land value; the replacement cost minus depreciation of the structure; the structure's actual cash value. 
    New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard". 
    Start of construction. For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, substantial improvement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erections of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure. For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. For insurance purposes, means: 
(1)  A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site;

(3)  A travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. 
For the latter purpose, "structure" does not mean recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in paragraph (3) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvements to a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)  Any project to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of the "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Variance. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of the floodplain management ordinance that allows construction in a manner otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    Violation. Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management ordinance. Construction or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, flood-proofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. No. O-10-5, § I, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 10-37. - Statement of policy. 
    It is hereby declared that residential mortgage foreclosure actions, caused in part by so-called sub-prime mortgage lending and predatory lending practices, as well as rising interest rates, unemployment and underemployment, have negatively impacted a substantial number of homeowners in the city, creating a foreclosure crisis which endangers the economic stability of the city and the health and safety of its citizens, as the increasing numbers of foreclosures lead to increases in unoccupied and unattended buildings in the city and give impetus to the continuation, extension and aggravation of urban blight and decay. More importantly, foreclosures cause the unnecessary and unwanted displacement of a considerable number of homeowners and tenants who desire to live and work in the city. 
(Ord. No. O-10-5, § I, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 10-38. - Purpose. 
    The city's purpose in sections 10-36 through 10-40, inclusive, is to protect the public health, safety and welfare by providing early, HUD-approved independent counseling agency-supervised intervention in residential owner-occupied mortgage foreclosure cases which will assure timely determination of eligibility under various federal, state and local programs established to facilitate loan work-out and other solutions to permit residential homeowners, where possible, to retain their properties and permit lenders to move forward to auction/sale of the properties and recordation of a foreclosure deed upon conclusion of the process. 
(Ord. No. O-10-5, § I, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 10-39. - Filing/recording of foreclosure deed. 
    Except as may be provided in this article, from and after the effective date of this article, no deed offered by a lender/mortgagee to be filed with the recorder of deeds as a result of a mortgage foreclosure action shall be accepted and/or recorded in the land evidence records of the city until and unless the following events have occurred: 
(a)  The lender/mortgagee shall provide written notice to the city of its intent to foreclose on the subject residential property at the same time it issues notice to the homeowner/mortgagor of the foreclosure action. Such notice must include plat and lot information. 
(b)  Said notice shall be filed by the lender/mortgagee with the recorder of deeds. 
(c)  Following the filing of such notice, the parties shall participate in a mandatory loan/mortgage conciliation conference at a location mutually convenient to the parties. Telephone participation by the lender/mortgagee is acceptable. 
(d)  Said conciliation conference shall be scheduled at a time and place to be determined by the conciliation conference coordinator, but not later than 30 days following the mailing of the notice of intent to foreclosure. The parties will be noticed by certified and first class mail. 
(e)  Prior to the scheduled conciliation conference, the homeowner/mortgagor will be assigned a loan counselor to be provided by a HUD-approved independent counseling agency. 
(f)  The homeowner/mortgagor shall cooperate in all respects with the housing counseling agency, providing all necessary financial and employment information. The homeowner/mortgagor shall complete any and all loan resolution proposals and applications as appropriate. 
(g)  The conciliation conference will require the exchange of information provided as required by subsection (f) to the representative of the lender/mortgagee. 
(h)  If after the two attempts by the conciliation conference coordinator to contact the homeowner/mortgagor, the homeowner/mortgagor fails to respond to the conference coordinator's request to appear for the conciliation conference, or the homeowner/mortgagor fails to cooperate in any respect with the requirements outlined in this article, the requirements of the article will be deemed to be satisfied upon verification by the HUD-approved independent counseling agency that the required notice was sent; and if so, a certificate will be issued immediately by the HUD-approved independent counseling agency authorizing the lender/mortgagee to proceed with the foreclosure action including recording the foreclosure deed. 
(i)  If it is determined after a good faith effort made by the lender/mortgagee at the conciliation conference with the homeowner/mortgagor, that the parties cannot come to an agreement to renegotiate the terms of the loan in an effort to avoid foreclosure, such good faith effort on behalf of the lender/mortgagee shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this article. A certificate certifying such good faith effort will be issued immediately by the HUD-approved independent counseling agency authorizing the lender/mortgagee to proceed with the foreclosure action, including recording the deed. Such a certification will be the form of a document to be filed along with all other relevant documents with the recorder of deeds. 
(j)  Upon the demand of the lender/mortgagee at any time following completion of the conciliation conference, if the lender/mortgagee is not invoking subsection (h), the HUD-approved independent counseling agency will immediately certify that the provisions of this article have been met. 
(k)  The parties shall complete the process required by this article within a period of 60 days from the initial notice provided in subsection (a). 
(l)  Cases involving premises which are not owner-occupied or which are not residential are not subject to the mandatory loan/mortgage conciliation conference and may proceed directly to foreclosure and recordation of the deed concerning such property. 
(m)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any lender/mortgagee which is headquartered within the State of Rhode Island and which services its own mortgages shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this section if: 
(1)  The lender/mortgagee provided homeowners a forbearance relief program that is consistent with the forbearance relief requirements applicable to FHA-Insured Mortgages, as set forth in Chapter 8 of the HUD Handbook 4330.1 Rev. 5, Administration of Insured Home Mortgages, as the same may be amended from time to time; and 
(2)  The deed offered by a lender/mortgagee to be filed with the recorder of deeds as a result of a mortgage foreclosure action contains a certification that the provisions of this subsection have been satisfied. 
(Ord. No. O-10-5, § I, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 10-40. - Penalties. 
    No deed offered by a lender/mortgagor to be filed with the recorder of deeds shall be accepted and/or recorded in the land evidence records of the city if it is determined that the lender/mortgagor has failed in any respect with the requirements and provisions of this article. In the event that a foreclosure has taken place without affording the homeowner of the relief afforded by this article, the recorder of deeds shall assess a penalty of $2,000.00 in addition to any other penalties and fees that may be assessed prior to recording the foreclosure deed. The rights of the homeowner to any redress afforded under the law are not abridged by this section.

In order for the Warwick Historic Cemeteries Commission to clearly assess the proposed project, the following information shall be submitted unless otherwise required by the historic cemeteries commission: 
(1)  Detailed site plans drawn to scale by a licensed professional registered land surveyor or professional engineer as applicable, at a minimum scale of 1?:40', showing the boundaries of the property in question, existing topographical contour intervals of no more than two feet, a surveyed boundary of the cemetery and a setback area of no less than 25 feet, and a proposed plan of all improvements on the site which would necessitate disturbance of the cemetery, or archaeological grave site.

Once a discovery of a previously unknown burial site is made or suspected, the owner or contractor shall immediately suspend operations and notify the building inspector, who in turn shall contact the planning department and the state medical examiner and the Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission pursuant to G.L. § 23-18. 
The city shall require the cessation of construction activities pending preliminary verification by the state medical examiner and historical preservation commission. If the site is verified as a human burial site, work within 25 feet of the site shall be halted unless or until a permit to alter or remove is issued by the Warwick Historic Cemeteries Commission pursuant to these regulations. 
The owner shall be required at his/her expense to conduct an archeological investigation of the area to establish the boundaries of the burial/cemetery sites via the least disruptive means feasible. The least disruptive means shall be determined in consultation with the Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission.

Sec. 20-241. - Member contributions. 
(a)  Generally. In Tier I, each member who is an employee will contribute 11 percent of his or her salary to the fund at the time of each payroll period. Such contributions shall begin at hire and shall cease when the member is no longer an employee. Beginning no later than July 1, 1998, the amount of the members' contributions shall be adjusted to one-third of the annual contribution rate for Tier I determined by the actuary in accordance with section 20-242(c). In Tier II, each member who is an employee will initially contribute the same percent of his or her salary as being contributed by Tier I members, however beginning no later than July 1, 2014, the amount of the members' contributions shall be adjusted to one-third of the annual contribution rate for Tier II determined by the actuary in accordance with section 20-242(c). The actuary shall evaluate Tier I and Tier II as a single fund for the purpose of determining the pension contributions for the city (the two-thirds share of the total), but shall determine separate employee contribution rates for members of Tier I and Tier II, reflecting one-third of the difference in the value of the benefit being provided under this plan for the two tiers. 
(b)  Pickup of contributions by city.

The employee contributions which are picked up shall be treated for all purposes of this plan in the same manner and to the same extent as employee contributions made prior to the date picked up.

(1)  Normal cost, net of employee contributions; and 
(2)  An amount determined by the actuary which with annual increases equal to the actuary's assumed rate of increase in base pay will amortize over 20 years the increase or decrease in the actuarial accrued liability after May 29, 1992, attributable to plan amendments, changes in actuarial assumptions, and actuarial experience gains and losses affecting members. 
The normal cost and actuarial accrued liability shall be determined using the entry age normal actuarial cost method and such actuarial assumptions as recommended by the actuary.

(c)  Beginning on February 1, 2014 and annually thereafter, the city will adjust its contribution rate to two-thirds of the contribution rate determined by the actuary in the most recent actuarial valuation.

Sec. 22-71. - Purpose and intent. 
    The council of the city finds and declares that: 
(1)  The city has a history and reputation for well-kept properties, and that the property values and the general welfare of this community are founded, in part, upon the appearance and maintenance of properties. 
(2)  There now appears need for further emphasis on the maintenance of public and private property in a clean, litter-free and debris-free condition because locations throughout the city have been found to have been the sites of littering, illegal dumping and accumulated garbage, refuse and rubbish. 
(3)  That the existence of such conditions is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of this city and contributes substantially and increasingly to the problems of the necessity for expenditures for protection against hazards and diminution of property values, prevention of crime and the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare and the maintenance of police, fire and accident protection; and that such problems are becoming increasingly direct and substantial in significance and effect; and that the uses and abuses of property as described herein reasonably relate to the proper exercise of the police power in the protection of health, safety and welfare of the public. 
(4)  That unless corrective measures are taken to alleviate such existing conditions and particularly to avoid future problems in this regard, the public health, safety and general welfare, and specifically the property values and social and economic standards of this community, will be depreciated; that the elimination of such conditions will enhance the appearance and value of such properties rather than be a burden on the owners thereof; and that elimination of such conditions will also appreciate the values and appearance of neighboring properties and benefit the use and enjoyment of properties in the general area and will improve the general welfare and image of the city.

(b)  Intent. It has been determined that the establishment and enforcement of minimum housing standards and the rehabilitation of housing are essential to the public health, safety and general welfare of the community. For this purpose the city has adopted minimum housing standards governing the condition and maintenance of all dwellings and established a division of minimum housing to enforce such standards. The division of minimum housing has determined a far greater number of violations in rental dwellings older than ten years.

(c)  Notification required; procedure; inspection. The owner of any rental housing unit is hereby required to notify the director of the termination of occupancy of any such unit and to secure the inspection and the written approval of the condition of the premises by the director before allowing any such unit to be reoccupied. The notification date may be within 15 days prior to termination of occupancy. If the director shall fail to inspect and grant or deny his/her written approval of the condition of the premises within three working days after receiving notice of the termination of occupancy, the owner of the premises shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this section. If such inspection reveals any violations of this Code or of the state housing maintenance and occupancy code, the director shall issue the appropriate violation notice to the tenant or to the owner of such unit pursuant to said codes. During the three-day period, it is the responsibility of the owner to make the unit available for inspection at the convenience of the director. 
(d)  Exceptions. 
(1)  The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to motel, hotel or rooming accommodations intended for temporary or seasonal use by guests. 
(2)  Units that have been constructed within the ten-year period prior to vacancy are exempt from the provisions of this section. This shall be determined by issuance of initial building permit. 
(3)  Any property owned by the city housing authority is exempt from the provisions of this section.

Any person found in violation of this section shall be subject to a fine pursuant to section 1-4 of the Warwick Code of Ordinances. 
(d)  Notice of violation. Upon a finding by the director, or his or her designee, that there exists stagnant water on a parcel of private property, a notice of violation shall be issued to the owner, lessee or occupant of the property by leaving same with any person of the age of majority in occupancy of said property, or if no person is available to receive notice, by posting same on any entry door to the primary structure which sites on said property, or if there is no structure, then by posting notice to any tree, pole or other object which sits upon said property. Notice shall also be mailed, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of record of said property according to the tax assessor's records. The notice shall contain the address of the property, notify the person receiving notice that the property is in violation of this article of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Warwick, describe generally, the nature of the violation and notify the recipient that the or she shall have five days from the date of the notice within which to abate the nuisance. The notice shall also provide that if the nuisance is not abated within five days of the mailing of the notice, then the department of building inspection may then forthwith proceed in the municipal court for imposition of fines and an order of abatement. The notice shall contain the date and time of the hearing, if any before the municipal court. 
(e)  Order of abatement. If, after the expiration of five days following the date of issuance of a notice of violation pursuant to this article, the nuisance remains unabated, then the director, or his or her designee may proceed for imposition of fines and an order of abatement to issue from the municipal court. A photograph or video recording of the body of stagnant water, together with evidence of the address of the property, the name and address of the property owner, lessee or occupier and that said nuisance remains unabated on the date of hearing before the municipal court shall constitute prima facie evidence of the existence of the unabated nuisance. Upon a finding by a judge of the municipal court that the nuisance remains unabated, then the court may impose a fine pursuant to section 1-4 of the Warwick Code of Ordinances for each day that the nuisance has existed and may issue an order of abatement after notice and opportunity for hearing has been given to the owner of the parcel according to the tax assessor's records and to the occupier of the land. Said order of abatement shall allow the director, or his or her designee, to enter upon the property and take whatever steps are necessary to abate the nuisance including, but not limited to filling, draining, or removal of the body of stagnant water which is the subject of the order of abatement. The director is authorized to request assistance from other city departments or agencies in performing the work needed to abate the nuisance and to contract said work pursuant to municipal bidding requirements under state law, and the Charter and Ordinances of the City of Warwick. All costs incurred by the city in abating the nuisance shall be reimbursed by the owner, lessee, or occupier of the land. 
(f)  Lien for abatement costs and fines. Any unpaid fines imposed pursuant to this article and costs incurred by the city in abating a stagnant water nuisance pursuant to subsection (e) shall constitute a lien on the property, which shall be recorded in the land evidence records of the City of Warwick, and shall be discharged only upon payment of all fines and costs imposed pursuant to this article.

Ambient noise is defined as all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment, being a composite of sounds from many sources, near and far. For the purpose of this section, ambient noise level is the average over 15 minutes excluding random or intermittent noises and the alleged offensive noise at the location and time of day at which a comparison with an alleged offensive noise is to be made. 
Averaging may be done by instrumental analysis in accordance with American National Standard S.13-1995, or may be done manually as follows: 
a.  Observe a sound level meter for five seconds and record the best estimate of central tendency of the indicator needle, and the highest and lowest indications. 
b.  Repeat the observations as many times as necessary to provide that observations be made at the beginning and at the end of the 15-minute averaging period and that there shall be at least as many additional observations as there are decibels between the lowest indication and the highest high indication. 
c.  Calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency indications. 
(3)  Any noise emanating from private property which is plainly audible by a person of reasonably sensitive hearing at a distance of 100 feet or any noise which constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property as a result of conduct constituting a violation of law shall be a violation of this section. Illustrative, but not exhaustive or exclusive of such unlawful conduct is excessive noise or traffic, obstruction of public streets by crowds or vehicles, illegal parking, public drunkenness, public urination, the service of alcohol to minors, fights, disturbances of the peace, and litter. 
(b)  Noise level measurements. For noise other than any noise emanating from private property which is plainly audible by a person of reasonably sensitive hearing at a distance of 100 feet or any noise which constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property as a result of conduct constituting a violation of law, noise level measurements should be taken at the property line of the noise generator which is closest to the residential use or zone, public street, public or private right-of-way, alley or thoroughfare that is being affected. All measurements shall be made with a sound level meter having an A-weighted scale, containing both fast and slow meter response capability and constructed in accordance with specifications as contained in the standards of the American National Standards Institute.

Where an invited guest engages in conduct which the sponsor or resident could not reasonably foresee and the conduct is an isolated instance of a guest at the event violating the law which the sponsor is unable to reasonably control without the intervention of the police, the unlawful conduct of the individual guest shall not be attributable to the sponsor or resident for the purposes of determining whether the event constitutes a public nuisance under this section. 
(f)  Penalty. Violation of this section, except those under section (a)(3), shall be punishable by a fine of $50.00 for the first and second offense by a person.

Sec. 40-54. - Legislative findings and intent. 
(a)  The use of tobacco for smoking purposes is being found to be increasingly dangerous, not only to the person smoking but also to the nonsmoking person who is required to breathe the contaminated air. A pervasive intrusion of the nonsmoker's right to unpolluted air space is the uncontrolled smoking on state beaches. 
(b)  The city is committed to keeping its beaches clean, safe, healthy, and pleasant for everyone. 
(1)  Smoking is hazardous to health and numerous studies have shown that secondhand smoke is a significant public health hazard. 
(2)  Smoking in public places, including beaches, endangers children and others by exposing them to secondhand smoke. 
(3)  The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a group A carcinogen, the most dangerous class of carcinogen. 
(4)  The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that secondhand smoke causes children to suffer from lower respiratory tract illnesses, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, exacerbates childhood asthma, and increases the risk of chronic middle ear infection in children. 
(5)  Discarding cigarettes butts, cigar butts, and tobacco waste on beach sand is unsightly, unclean, and particularly hazardous to small children who handle and sometimes ingest them. 
(6)  Cigarette butts are the top pollutant on beaches and, if uncollected, may wash directly into ocean waters to the detriment of marine life and all ocean users.

Sec. 52-82. - Pension increases. 
For Tier I 
(a)  As of January 1, 1972, and as of January 1 of each year thereafter, the city finance director shall adjust the pension of each pensioner receiving payments under this revised pension fund and the spouse or children of deceased police members entitled to pension benefits hereunder, in accordance with increases or decreases in the Consumer Price Index (U.S. all items index) compiled by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, determined and limited as follows. Such index for October of the immediately preceding calendar year shall be divided by the corresponding index for October of the next previous calendar year, and the percentage of increase or decrease shall be determined. All pension payments for the current calendar year shall be increased or decreased from the rate payable during the immediately preceding calendar year by the percentage thus determined, except that in no event shall the increase or decrease exceed three percent for any single year. Furthermore, no downward adjustment shall decrease any pension to a lesser amount than the original amount of the pension benefit at retirement. In the case of any pensioner who has been retired for less than one full year on any January 1, a fractional adjustment shall be made corresponding to the period elapsed since the effective date of his/her retirement. No adjustments shall be made to the pension of any pensioner for or on account of increases or decreases in said Consumer Price Index occurring prior to said pensioner's being placed on the pension list. 
(b)  Effective July 1, 1986, beginning on January 1, 1987, and on each January 1 thereafter, the pension adjustment described above shall be an increase of three percent, regardless of increases or decreases in the Consumer Price Index. 
For Tier II 
(a)  For Tier II retirees, the pension payable under sections 52-76, 52-77 but not section 52-78, shall be increased each January 1 by 75 percent of the prior calendar year's Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), but not less than zero nor more than three percent, for all Tier II retirees or beneficiaries of Tier II members on whose account benefits have been paid for at least 12 months. In the case of Tier II members or beneficiaries who have been in receipt of benefits for fewer than 12 months, a fractional increase shall be made equal to the above calculation multiplied by the number of complete months of payments made divided by 12. For the purposes of this section, the prior calendar year shall mean the calendar year ending 12 months and one day prior to the date the indexation is payable. 
(Code 1971, § 15-52; Ord. No. O-08-11, § I, 7-8-08; Ord. No. O-11-7, § 1(Exh. A), 5-17-11)

(a)  Determination. The city plans and intends to maintain this revised pension fund on a sound actuarial basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting and actuarial practice so that, insofar as practicable, two-thirds of the cost of this retirement system will be paid by the city and one-third of such cost will be paid by the contributions from officers and members to whom the terms of this article apply. Such contribution rates shall be determined on the basis of such mortality, interest and other actuarial assumptions as shall be adopted by the board of public safety, subject to the approval of the city council. For this purpose, the board of public safety may employ an actuary, an individual or a firm, at least one of whose employees is a member of the Society of Actuaries, and such other assistance as it shall deem expedient to assist in determining the cost of benefits provided hereunder and the corresponding contribution rates of members and officers. 
(b)  Member contributions. Commencing February 1, 1971, eight percent of the annual salary (including longevity payments) paid to each member and officer participating in this revised pension fund shall be deducted and placed in the fund. For Tier II employees hired after June 30, 2012, the employee contribution shall initially be the same as the most recently adjusted contribution for Tier I employees. 
(c)  City contributions. Commencing February 1, 1971, an amount equal to 16 percent of the annual salary (including longevity payments) paid to each member and officer participating in this revised pension fund shall be contributed by the city and placed in the fund. For Tier II employees hired after June 30, 2012, the city contribution shall initially be the same as for the most recently adjusted contribution for Tier I employees. 
(d)  Periodic review. Beginning with the actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2013 and annually thereafter, the board of public safety shall be required to have made an actuarial study of this retirement system in order to review the experience under the plan and to determine what revision, if any, is required in the contribution rates established hereunder to maintain the fund on a sound actuarial basis with the city contributing two-thirds and the members one-third of cost of plan benefits. The actuarial study shall be received by the board by the February 1 following the valuation date. The actuary shall evaluate Tier I and Tier II as a single fund for the purpose of determining the pension contributions for the city (the two-thirds share of the total), but shall determine separate employee contribution rates for members of Tier I and Tier II, reflecting one-third of the difference in the value of the benefit being provided under this plan for the two tiers.

(Code 1971, § 16-81) 
Sec. 60-152. - Total disability defined. 
    A member will be considered totally disabled if the medical board certifies that he/she is wholly prevented from engaging in any occupation for wage or profit and the retirement board approves his/her application for benefits. 
(Code 1971, § 16-82) 
Sec. 60-153. - Disability pension computation. 
    Upon retirement for disability a member will be entitled to receive a disability retirement pension calculated as for normal service retirement but based on his/her years of creditable service and final average compensation as of the date of his/her written application for disability retirement. 
(Code 1971, § 16-83) 
Sec. 60-154. - Date on which disability payments commence. 
(a)  The retirement board, in approving the application for disability retirement, shall determine the date from which benefits are payable, which date shall be the first of the month that is not less than 90 working days after the date of disability, and not over two months prior to the date of approval. No disability benefits shall be payable during any period the member is receiving compensation from his/her employer. 
(b)  If a member who is eligible for early retirement as defined in section 60-102 has a disability application pending with the medical board, he/she may elect to receive an early retirement pension until his/her application for disability is acted upon. In order to exercise this option, a member must submit to the retirement board proof that he/she has a disability application pending before the medical board, along with supporting evidence from a licensed medical doctor which describes the medical condition which constitutes the disability. The retirement board will grant the member six months from commencement of early retirement benefits to prove his/her disability. The six-month period may be extended by the retirement board based upon the facts and circumstances of the application. 
(c)  If the medical board denies the member's application for a disability pension, the member will be deemed to have elected early retirement as of the date his/her early retirement pension commenced, and there will be no adjustment to his/her early retirement benefits being paid. If the member's application for disability is approved, he/she will begin receiving a disability pension in lieu of his/her early retirement pension with the change in monthly benefit effective as soon as possible (the "benefit increase date"). His/her benefits will also be adjusted by the difference between: 
(1)  The early retirement benefits paid as of the benefit increase date; and 
(2)  The retroactive disability benefits which would otherwise have been payable. 
(d)  Any such adjustment shall be made by increasing or decreasing the monthly benefits over a period no greater than 12 months.

If the value of the total computed benefits under any such worker's compensation law or action is less than the actuarial reserve on the benefits otherwise payable from funds provided by the municipality under this article, the value of the computed payments shall be deducted from such actuarial reserve and such benefits as may be provided by the actuarial reserve so reduced shall be payable under the provisions of this article.

    Should the medical board report and certify to the retirement board that a retired member receiving a disability pension at any time before attainment of age 65 is able to engage in gainful occupation, and should the retirement board concur in such report, the retirement board shall direct that the disability retirement pension be discontinued. Should the retirement board find that a retired member receiving a disability pension is engaged in a gainful occupation at any time before attainment of age 65, the pension may be reduced or discontinued at the option of the retirement board.

DIVISION 3. - SERVICE 

Sec. 60-361. - Service credited on account of employment. 
(a)  Creditable service includes the sum of the periods of continuous employment with the city commencing on the date the member became an eligible employee and ending on the date the member terminates employment. For purposes of calculating benefits, creditable service is measured in full years and completed months of service. For example, a member hired on July 1, 1985, who terminates on April 15, 1996, has ten years and nine months of creditable service. 
(b)  A member shall receive no creditable service for any unpaid leave of absence longer than 30 days, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section. For example, a member hired on July 1, 1985, who has an unpaid leave of absence from April 1, 1996, until July 1, 1996, and who terminates employment on April 15, 1998, would receive creditable service as follows: 
July 1, 1985-April 1, 1996 10 years, 9 months July 1, 1996-April 15, 1998  1 year, 9 months Total 12 years, 6 months Creditable service 12 years, 6 months  
(c)  A member shall earn one-fourth of a month of creditable service for each month during which he or she does all of the following: 
(1)  Receives benefits under the provisions of any worker's compensation law and is paid a portion of sick time for the difference between regular pay and worker's compensation benefits; 
(2)  Makes contributions to the fund from the portion of sick time paid; and 
(3)  Would receive no creditable service except that provided under this subsection (c). 
Creditable service received under this subsection (c) shall be expressed in whole months; any fractional months shall be rounded up to the next whole month. For example, a member who received worker's compensation and made pension contributions from the portion of sick leave paid for nine months would receive three months of creditable service (21/4 months rounded up to three months). 
(d)  Creditable service shall be granted for an unpaid leave of absence due to compulsory military service or military service in time of war, provided the member returns to active employment within 90 days after separation from military service, and further provided that the member has not received a refund of his or her contributions under section 60-395(a). 
(Ord. No. O-93-31, § I(3.1), 12-13-93)

    If a member who has received a refund of his or her accumulated contributions resumes employment with the city within 12 months after his or her employment was terminated, the member's creditable service as of the date of termination shall be restored provided that he or she repays to the fund upon reemployment an amount equal to the distribution the member received under section 60-395(a), plus interest, at a rate and in accordance with regulations determined by the retirement board. The member shall be solely responsible for repaying the amount specified above immediately, but not later than 30 calendar days, upon reemployment. 
    If a member who terminates employment does not receive a distribution of his or her accumulated contributions at termination, and resumes employment with the city within 26 months after his or her employment was terminated, his or her creditable service as of the date of termination will be restored.

(Ord. No. O-93-31, § I(3.3), 12-13-93) 
Sec. 60-364. - Buyback of military service. 
(a)  Effective March 1, 2009, if a member has, prior to his or her termination of employment or earlier death: 
(1)  Been honorably discharged from service with the armed forces of the United States; 
(2)  Completed at least eight years of creditable service; and 
(3)  Attained age 55 or met the eligibility requirements for benefits under section 60-391, 60-392, 60-394(b) or 60-395(b); 
then the member (or the surviving spouse of the deceased member based upon the military service of the member) will be eligible to buy back up to four years of additional creditable service by contributing to the fund at the time of termination (or commencement of death benefits under section 60-394(b)) eight percent of the member's final year's annual salary, which shall include longevity, for each year of creditable service purchased. In order to preclude duplication of service credit, the member's military service must have been completed prior to the member's employment with the city to be eligible for buyback. 
(b)  A member or surviving spouse eligible to purchase benefits under subsection (a) above has the option to buy up to four years of creditable service in monthly increments, but no more than the number of the member's full years of military service (i.e., time actually spent on active duty, as verified by form DD214 or its equivalent). 
(c)  A member or surviving spouse will receive credit for one year of vesting service for each year or creditable service purchased, up to two years of vesting service. 
(d)  In no case will a member (or surviving spouse of a deceased member) who has received service credit for a period of military service of the member under any other retirement plan qualified under Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) be permitted to purchase benefits under this section for the same period of military service.

Sec. 60-365. - Special service purchase option for certain employees. 
    Effective June 30, 1989, any employee who became a member on February 1, 1988, as a result of the plan amendment which removed the restriction on membership for employees hired after age 60 shall have the option to purchase retirement eligibility at any time. This purchase shall be effected by the member's contributing to the fund six percent of his or her current salary, multiplied by the number of years (with fractional years measured as completed months divided by 12) remaining until February 1, 1993. On the first of the month following the member's additional contribution described in this section, the member shall be eligible to retire in accordance with section 60-391, and shall be considered to have attained his or her normal retirement age. The member's years of creditable service shall include the additional years purchased in accordance with this section, but in no event will the total creditable service for a member purchasing service under this section exceed five years. 
(Ord. No. O-93-31, § I(3.5), 12-13-93) 
Sec. 60-366. - Service purchase option for accumulated sick leave. 
    At the time a member terminates his or her employment, the member may, if allowed by personnel rules or by union contract, apply unused sick leave to purchase additional months of creditable service equal to 100 percent of the member's months of unused sick leave, provided the member is vested. 
(Ord. No. O-94-28, § I, 11-21-94) 
Sec. 60-367. - Retirement board rules. 
    The retirement board shall fix and determine by proper rules and regulations how much service in one year is equivalent to one year of creditable service, but in no case shall more than one year be creditable for all service in one calendar year, nor shall the retirement board allow credit as service for any period of more than one month's duration during which the member was absent without pay, except as provided in section 60-361(d).

Sec. 60-392. - Early retirement benefits. 
    A member who has reached his or her early retirement age may apply to the retirement board for retirement and payment of pension benefits.

Sec. 60-393. - Disability retirement benefits. 
(a)  General eligibility. A member who has completed ten years of vesting service (six years of vesting service for an elected official), and is totally disabled as defined in subsection (b) of this section prior to normal retirement age, will be retired upon application to the retirement board and will receive a disability retirement pension payable for life, except as specified elsewhere in this section. 
(b)  Total disability defined. A member will be considered totally disabled if the retirement board certifies that he or she is in receipt of social security disability benefits. 
(c)  Amount of benefit. Upon retirement for disability a member will be entitled to receive a disability pension determined in accordance with section 60-391 based on his or her final average salary and years of creditable service as of the date he or she became disabled, without reduction for commencement of benefits prior to normal retirement age. 
(d)  Commencement of disability payments. The retirement board, in approving the application for disability retirement, shall determine the date from which benefits are payable, which date shall be the first of the month following the later of the last day on which the member receives salary from the city and the date his or her social security disability benefits are first payable. No disability benefits shall be payable during any period the member is receiving a salary from the city. 
(e)  Disabled member eligible for early retirement. 
(1)  If a member who is eligible for early retirement as defined in section 60-392 has a disability application pending with the retirement board, he or she may elect to receive an early retirement pension until his or her application for disability is acted upon. In order to exercise this option, the member must submit to the retirement board proof that he or she has a disability application pending before the Social Security Administration and the retirement board, along with supporting evidence from a licensed medical doctor which describes the medical condition which constitutes the disability. The retirement board will grant the member six months from commencement of early retirement benefits to prove his or her disability. The six-month period may be extended by the retirement board based upon the facts and circumstances of the application. 
(2)  If the retirement board denies the member's application for a disability pension, the member will be deemed to have elected early retirement as of the date his or her early retirement pension commenced, and there will be no adjustment to the early retirement benefits being paid. If the member's application for disability is approved, he or she will begin receiving a disability pension in lieu of his or her early retirement pension with the change in monthly benefit effective as soon as possible (the "benefit increase date"). His or her benefits will also be adjusted by the difference between: 
a.  The early retirement benefits paid as of the benefit increase date; and 
b.  The retroactive disability benefits which would otherwise have been payable. 
Any such adjustment shall be made by increasing or decreasing the monthly benefits over a period no greater than 12 months. 
(f)  Effect of worker's compensation payments or personal injury recovery payments on disability payments. 
(1)  Any pension payments from the plan under this section shall be reduced and offset (but not below zero) by the amount of any periodic payments to the member under the provisions of any worker's compensation law or on account of recovery of damages for personal injury to the member from the city, on account of death or disability of a member occurring while in the performance of duty. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection (f), the value of any lump sum payments to the member on account of worker's compensation or personal injury recovery shall be converted to monthly payments which are the actuarial equivalent of such lump sum. 
(g)  Proof of receipt of social security disability benefits. As a condition for receiving a disability pension, each retiree who is younger than age 65 and is in receipt of a disability pension in accordance with this section shall furnish annually to the retirement board evidence satisfactory to the board of his or her continued receipt of social security disability payments. 
(h)  Effect of restoration to health on disability pension. Should the retirement board find that a retiree receiving a disability pension at any time before attainment of age 65 is no longer in receipt of social security disability payments or is engaged in any gainful occupation, the retirement board shall direct that the disability retirement pension be discontinued and the member's pension benefits determined in accordance with section 60-392 or 60-395, as applicable. 
(i)  Effect of reemployment on disability pension. Should a retiree receiving a disability pension again become an employee, his or her disability retirement pension shall cease and he or she shall immediately become an active member of the plan upon reemployment. For purposes of determining subsequent pension benefits, his or her creditable service at the time of disability retirement shall be restored in full force and effect.

In the event of death of such a former member after termination of employment or ceasing to be an eligible employee and prior to receiving his or her accumulated contributions, his or her accumulated contributions shall be paid to his or her beneficiary.

On the June 30 one year prior to the determination date, the asset value before adjustment and the market value of assets shall be determined. If the market value of assets exceeds the asset value before adjustment by an amount equal to six percent or more of the actuarial accrued liability of the benefits of all retirees and beneficiaries as determined by the actuary, then an adjustment to the monthly benefit is warranted as of the determination date. An increase in monthly benefits may be granted, such that the resulting increase in actuarial accrued liability (measured as if the change were effective on the June 30 prior to the determination date) does not exceed one-third of the amount by which the market value of assets exceeded the asset value before adjustment and such that the percentage increase in monthly benefits does not exceed the sum of the negotiated percentage increases in base pay covered under the collective bargaining agreement effective for eligible employees during the 12-month period ending on the June 30 one year prior to the determination date. If an increase in the monthly benefits is granted, then the adjustment referred to in the definition of asset value after adjustment shall equal two times the actuarial accrued liability attributable to the increase in monthly benefits. 
(c)  "Asset value after adjustment" defined. On June 30, 1988, and on each subsequent June 30, the asset value after adjustment shall mean the asset value before adjustment plus the adjustment determined according to subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  "Asset value before adjustment" defined. On June 30, 1989, and on each subsequent June 30, the asset value before adjustment shall mean the asset value after adjustment on the previous June 30, adjusted for contributions, benefit payments and administrative expenses, and credited with interest at the interest rate in effect for the year. 
(e)  "Interest rate in effect for the year" defined. The interest rate in effect for the year means the sum of the negotiated percentage increases in base pay under the collective bargaining agreement covering eligible employees during the 12-month period ending on the June 30 one year prior to the determination date, plus three percent. 
(f)  "Market value of assets" defined. The market value of assets shall be the current value of fund assets as reported by the trustee. 
(g)  "Determination date" defined. The determination date shall be June 30 of each year.

Sec. 64-6. - Military time for city employees. 
    Preamble: The city recognizes and salutes the continued sacrifices of its active duty and drilling reserve military. The stated purpose of title 38 § 4301 in the US Code entitled Employment and Reemployment Rights of the Uniformed Services Act is: "to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service." The reserve components of the United States Armed Forces, also known as the Guard and Reserve fulfill a critical mission for our country's homeland security by performing a minimum of 38 days of military duty per year which includes weekend drill status and two weeks training status. They are also responsible for augmenting the active duty (or full-time) military when necessary. City employees who continue to serve their country as members of the Guard and Reserve reduce their much needed down time by using annual vacation/leave or comp time during their monthly drills amounting to approximately 24 days per year for which the city should compensate these employees. 
(1)  The city will provide 12 days of "military time" annually to each full-time permanent or full-time temporary city employee who is a member of the Guard or Reserves. 
(2)  The city employee must provide a copy of his/her leave and earning statement (LES) following the date(s) requested for "military time" to have vacation or comp time restored. 
(3)  City employees who utilize "military time" will not receive their regular city pay however, benefits and time in service for pensions or seniority will not be interrupted. 
(4)  City "military time" may not be accrued beyond each fiscal year (July 1 to June 30), may not be traded/shared with another member of the Guard/Reserve and may not be sold back to the city for any personal monetary gain.

Sec. 68-8. - Technical standards. 
    All applicants are required to develop and submit a storm water management plan prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Rhode Island. All storm water management plans must address storm water management on a site-by-site basis and all requirements of this chapter. All storm water management practices shall be consistent with the Rhode Island Storm Water Design and Installation Standards Manual and the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, as amended. 
(1)  Performance standards. Storm water management plans shall incorporate structural and non-structural best management practices (BMPs) for water quality control, in accordance with Rhode Island Storm Water Design and Installation Standards Manual. Development in chinking water supply watersheds or watersheds where impaired waters as defined by the state's 303(d) list exist may be held to higher standards. 
(2)  Disallowed storm water best management practices. The placement of storm water structures within a flood plain shall be avoided. If there is no alternative, the applicant must show what effects, if any, the tailwaters created by the flood plain will have on the outflow and effective storage capacity of the storm water best management practice. 
(3)  Facilitation of maintenance. Facilities that require maintenance shall be designed to minimize the need for regular maintenance, facilitate required maintenance, and ensure accessibility of components that require maintenance. At a minimum, all storm water management plans must incorporate BMPs with appropriate maintenance design in accordance with the Rhode Island Storm Water Design and Installation Standards Manual, as amended. 
a.  Control and maintenance of post-development peak discharge rates from the 2-year, 10-year, 25-year, and 100-year storm events to pre-development levels. 
b.  Downstream analysis of the 100-year storm event and control of the peak discharge rate for the 100-year storm to mitigate downstream impacts. 
c.  Discharge from any storm water facility must be conveyed through properly constructed conveyance system to provide for non-erosive flows during all storm events. The proposed storm water conveyance system consisting of open channels, pipes, and other conveyance devices shall at a minimum accommodate the runoff from a 25-year storm event. The storm water conveyance system must provide for non-erosive flows to receiving waters. 
(4)  Flood protection. Storm water management plans shall demonstrate that a proposed project provides for protection of life and property from flooding and flood flows. Water quantities must be controlled in accordance with the Rhode Island Storm Water Design and Installation Standards Manual, as amended, or a municipally approved regional storm water management plan for the watershed in which the project site is located. Storm water management plans shall demonstrate incorporation of the following standards into the proposed project: 
(5)  Surface water and groundwater. Storm water management plans shall, in accordance with the Rhode Island Storm Water Design and Installation Standards Manual, as amended, demonstrate that during development and post-development, all receiving waters will be recharged in a manner closely resembling pre-development conditions and that the developed site will retain hydrological conditions that closely resemble of those prior to disturbance. The goal of the storm water design shall be that hydrologic conditions in each sub-watershed match pre-development conditions. 
Where practicable, development and re-development projects should aim to reduce runoff volumes. This may include minimizing and eliminating impervious surface areas such as roads, parking, paving or other surfaces, encouraging infiltration of a non-contaminated runoff, preventing channelization, encouraging sheet flow, and where appropriate, preserving, enhancing or establishing buffers along surface water bodies and tributaries. 
(Ord. No. O-16-17, § I(Exh. A), 8-17-16) 
Sec. 68-9. - Storm water management plans.

(3)  Weighted curve numbers as determined using Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds (USDA Soil Conservation Service, 1986 or as amended). 
(4)  Invert elevations for inlets and outlets. In addition, invert elevations shall be provided for all basins including permanent and/or flood pool stages, including peak discharge rates for each stage. 
(5)  The total volume capacity for all flood control and water quality BMPs (e.g., infiltration basin, detention basins, wet ponds, etc.). Volumes must be segregated into permanent arid flood pool stage volumes where applicable. Furthermore, the volumes of all sediment storage (basins, forebays, etc.) areas must also be provided. 
(6)  Pre-development and post-development peak discharge rates and runoff volumes for the 2-year, 10-year, 25-year, and 100-year frequency storm events for each sub-watershed to each separate water or discharge point. The water quality volume must also be calculated for each sub-watershed. All relevant variables such as curve numbers and time of concentration, along with the supporting computations and worksheets must be included. The entire site shall be included in an evaluated sub-watershed. 
(7)  Supporting calculations to demonstrate that the proposed development project will meet section 69-6 of this chapter. 
(b)  Narrative description. As part of the storm water management plan, the applicant shall include a discussion of the protection of environmental resource functions and values. The following outline is provided as guidance for preparing a narrative description for the storm water management plan. Depending on the size and scope of the proposed project, the amount of information required by the city may vary; therefore, it is advised to consult the city for specific requirements.

Sec. 68-10. - Performance bond. 
(a)  Generally. 
(1)  Before approving an erosion and sediment control plan, the building official may require the applicant/owner to file a surety company performance bond or deposit of money or negotiable securities. When any land disturbing activity is to take place within 100 feet of any watercourse or within an identified flood hazard district, or on slopes in excess of ten percent, the filing of a performance bond shall be required. The amount of such bond, as determined by the public works department, shall be sufficient to cover the cost of implementing all erosion and sediment control measures as shown on the plan. 
(2)  The bond or negotiable security filed by the applicant shall be subject to approval of the form, content, amount and manner of execution by the public works director and the city solicitor. 
(3)  A performance bond for an erosion and sediment control plan for a subdivision may be included in the performance bond of the subdivision. The posting of such bond as part of the subdivision performance bond does not, however, relieve the owner of any requirement(s) of this chapter. 
(b)  Notice of default on performance secured by bond. 
(1)  Whenever the building official shall find that a default has occurred in the performance of any term(s) or condition(s) of the bond or in the implementation of measures secured by the bond, written notice thereof shall be made to the applicant and to the surety of the bond by the municipal solicitor. Such notice shall state the nature of default, the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof, and the period of time deemed by the building official to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. 
(2)  Failure of the applicant to acknowledge and comply with the provisions and deadlines outlined in such notice of default shall mean the institution, by the city solicitor, without further notice of proceedings whatsoever, of appropriate measures to utilize the performance bond to cause the required work to be completed by the city, by contract or by other appropriate means as determined by the city solicitor. 
(c)  Notice of default on performance secured by cash or negotiable securities deposit. If a cash or negotiable securities deposit has been posted by the applicant, the notice and procedure shall be the same as provided for in subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  Release from conditions. The performance bonding requirement shall remain in full force and effect until satisfactory completion of the work.

(b)  The city may clear, or may cause to be cleared, snow and ice from any priority sidewalk at any time, and if the owner of any lot of land adjoining or including such priority sidewalk is at such time in violation of section 70-102, the city may charge such owner for the cost of such clearing, provided that any such charge shall be credited against any fine imposed on such person in respect of any such violation existing at such time, and further provided that this clause (b) shall not relieve any owner for responsibility for compliance with section 70-102. 
(c)  Any owner who is a natural person and who has been exempted from penalties under clauses (a) and (b) of this section through a determination of hardship by the city, through the applicable procedures of the city for such determination as may be in effect from time to time, (which procedures may include submission of appropriate Social Security Disability Award documentation and/or for owners age 62 and older, proof of age, to the department of human services), shall not be subject to such penalties. A list of the properties owned exclusively by owners exempted under this clause (c) will be submitted to the Warwick Police Department and the department of public works in order to establish a "do not tag for violation" list. For avoidance of doubt, the city may, but is not required to clear any sidewalk on behalf of any owner exempted under this clause (c), and the city is not required to pay any amount to clear any such sidewalk. An owner of property on a state road with no priority sidewalk is exempt from the penalties under this section.

ARTICLE VII. - TAX STABILIZATION FOR WARWICK INTERMODAL DISTRICT 

Sec. 74-147. - Declaration of purpose and findings. 
(a)  The city council has the authority, pursuant to the relevant provisions of G.L. § 44-3-9, as amended, to exempt from tax payment, in whole or in part, real and personal property which has undergone environmental remediation, is historically preserved, or is used for affordable housing, manufacturing, commercial or residential purposes, or to determine a stabilized amount of taxes to be paid on account of the property, notwithstanding the valuation of the property or the rate of tax. 
(b)  The city council has determined that Warwick Intermodal District is a priority economic development opportunity for Warwick in that the presence of intermodal transportation in the district presents an opportunity for high-value, high-quality, mixed-use growth. 
(c)  The city council has determined that in order to increase the pace of economic development and redevelopment in the Warwick Intermodal District, and thereby increase the city's tax base, it is vital that the city provide property developers, entrepreneurs and investors with a predictable tax phase-in plan that will encourage investment in the Warwick Intermodal District. The city council finds and declares further that it is in the public interest to develop a set of clear criteria for eligibility for tax stabilization, as well as a defined long-term plan to bring a project to full taxation. Accordingly, the city council finds that granting the stabilization provided for in this article will inure to the benefit of the city by reason of, but not limited to, the following: 
1.  Increasing the willingness of residential, commercial, hospitality and mixed-use developers to locate in the Warwick Intermodal District; 
2.  Increasing the willingness of business dependent and business efficient facilities to locate and expand with an increase in employment or the willingness of commercial, mixed-use and hospitality business development to locate, retain or expand its facility in Warwick and not substantially reduce its work force in Warwick; 
3.  Resulting in improvement of the physical and infrastructure assets of a key intermodal area in Warwick which will result in a long-term economic benefit to Warwick; and 
4.  Increasing the willingness of mixed-use commercial, hospitality and residential developers and property owners to construct new or to replace, reconstruct, convert, expand, retain or remodel existing buildings, facilities, with modern buildings, facilities, fixtures, equipment resulting in residential housing, hospitality and/or mixed use commercial building investment in Warwick's Intermodal District. 
(d)  The city council in adopting the City of Warwick Comprehensive Plan 2013-2033 and in enacting a Historic Overlay Zoning District in the City of Warwick Code of Ordinances, Appendix A, Zoning, as amended, has determined that the redevelopment of certain existing structures within the City of Warwick's Historic Districts also satisfies the purposes and qualifies for the findings set forth above.

(Code 1971, § 22-196) 
Sec. 76-216. - Removal and impounding of illegally parked vehicles. 
(a)  Generally. Any police officer may remove and impound, or cause to be removed or impounded, any vehicle illegally parked upon any street or highway in such violation of any parking regulation or ordinance (other than overtime parking) as to constitute an obstruction to traffic or as to create an unsafe condition, thus jeopardizing public safety; provided, nevertheless, that the police department shall, within 48 hours, notify the vehicle owner of the removal or impoundment and of the opportunity for a hearing before the municipal court at which the owner may contest the towing (or the deprivation of the vehicle) and the payment of costs or charges accompanying the towing or impoundment; all substantially in accordance with the procedure set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  Post-seizure hearing. 
(1)  Notice and request for hearing. As to any vehicle towed or impounded pursuant to this section by or at the request of the city or its agents or employees, a person who has a legal entitlement to possession of the vehicle has a right to a post-seizure hearing to determine whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle if such person files a written demand on forms so provided for such a hearing with the municipal court within ten days after such person has learned such vehicle has been impounded, or within ten days after the mailing of the date set in the notice of stored vehicle, whichever occurs first. The notice of stored vehicle shall be sent in the mail to the legal and registered owner, or his or her agent, and to the garage where the vehicle is stored, within 72 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, after impounding and storage of the vehicle. 
(2)  Conduct of hearing. 
a.  A hearing shall be conducted before the judge of the municipal court within 48 hours of receipt of a written demand therefor from the person seeking the hearing, unless such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays, Sundays, and legal and city holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of the 48-hour period. The sole issue before the judge shall be whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. 
b.  "Probable cause to impound" shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was a sufficient breach of local, state or federal law to grant legal authority for the removal of the vehicle. 
c.  The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right to possession of the vehicle. The police department shall carry the burden of establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge shall prepare a brief written decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the registered owner of the vehicle. The judge's decision in no way affects any criminal proceeding in connection with the impoundment in question, and any criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the appropriate court. The decision of the judge is final. Failure of the registered or legal owner or his/her agent to request or attend a scheduled post-seizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such hearing. 
(3)  Decisions of judge and their effect. The judge shall only determine that, as to the vehicle in question, either there was probable cause to impound the vehicle or there was no such probable cause. In the event that the judge determines that there was no probable cause, the judge shall prepare and date a certificate of no probable cause, copies of which shall be given to the possessor of the vehicle and the police department. Upon receipt of the possessor's copy of such certificate, the official towing service company having custody of the vehicle shall release the vehicle to its possessor. Upon a finding of no probable cause, towing and storage fees shall be paid by the city in accordance with arrangements made between the city and the authorized garages. If the possessor fails to present such certificate to the authorized garage having custody of the vehicle within 24 hours of its receipt, excluding such days when the garage is not open for business, the possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges. Such certificate shall advise the possessor of such requirement. 
(c)  Payment of charges. All towing and storage fees shall be paid to the carrier in the usual business manner before any such vehicle shall be released, except for vehicles towed during periods when emergency regulations controlling parking and traffic movements during storm periods are in effect. The payment of such towing and storage charges shall not release the operator or owner of the vehicle from any penalty imposed for violation of any traffic regulations. 
(Code 1971, § 22-197) 
Sec. 76-217. - Removal of disabled or abandoned vehicles on public highway-Generally.

(b)  Use of towing service. If the owner or operator of a disabled or abandoned motor vehicle is unable or unwilling to remove such motor vehicle by his/her own efforts or resources within a reasonable time as directed by the police department, he/she shall be directed to call or designate a towing service of his/her own choice to remove the vehicle.

303. - District boundaries. 
    The boundaries of said districts including all overlay districts are hereby established as shown on the assessor's plats of the City of Warwick, each entitled "zoning plat," which are adopted as part of this ordinance and which are on file in the office of the city clerk. 
    303.1.  Split lots. Wherever a district boundary splits a lot into two or more separate zoning districts, the proposed use shall be permitted only if it is allowed in the district in question. The dimensional requirements for such permitted use shall be determined by the district in which it is located. Where a proposed use is permitted in two or more districts on the same lot, the dimensional requirements, other than density, shall be determined by the district's dimensional regulations which represent 50 percent or more of the lot or contains the most lot area, except as provided in subsection 405.4(D). For density requirements, all portions of the lot shall be calculated proportionately. 
    303.2.  Interpretation. Where, due to the scale, lack of detail or illegibility of the zoning plats of the City of Warwick, it shall be determined that the boundary lines of districts are lot lines, centerlines of streets or such lines extended, railroad right-of-way lines, or the centerlines of watercourses. Questions concerning the text of this ordinance and the exact location of district boundary lines as shown on the zoning plats shall be decided by the building official. Any person aggrieved by such interpretation of the building official may appeal such interpretation to the zoning board of review. 
304. - General provisions. 
    304.1.  Zoning affects every structure and use. No structure shall be constructed, erected, placed, moved or maintained nor shall the exterior be altered and no land use shall be commenced or continued within the city unless in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located, except as provided for in section 400, Nonconformance. 
    304.2.  Reduction of lot and yard areas prohibited. No lot, yard, required open space, or off-street parking area shall be so reduced, diminished, or maintained that the yards, other open space, total lot area, or off-street parking area shall be smaller than prescribed by this ordinance. 
    304.3.  Required yards cannot be used by another use or building. No part of a yard, parking space, or other open space required for any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance shall be included as part of a yard, parking space, or other open space required under this ordinance for another use or building except as provided in subsection 701.5. 
    304.4.  Only one dwelling structure on any lot. In no case shall there be more than one residential building and its accessory buildings on one lot except that PDR, PUD, and two-family and/or multiple-family developments may permit more than one residential structure per lot in conformity with subsections 308, 309, and 502, respectively, of this ordinance. 
    304.5.  More than one nonresidential use or building on a lot. More than one nonresidential structure may be allowed on a single lot within appropriately zoned nonresidential districts if devoted to the same actual use. Upon application to the zoning board of review, a special use permit may be granted in accordance with subsection 906 of this ordinance, where more than one actual use on a lot may be requested, provided however that such uses shall be only those that are permitted within the district in question. In both instances, principal front and rear walls of a building shall be at least 40 feet from any wall of another building. Any side wall of a building may not be less than 25 feet from any side wall of another building. More than one nonresidential use and/or structure is allowed on a single lot within the Warwick Station Intermodal and Gateway Districts without zoning board of review approval being necessary, provided however, that such uses may be only those that are permitted in the district in question. 
    More than one nonresidential use or more than one residential use and non residential use is allowed on a single lot or building within a village district without zoning board of review approval being necessary provided that such uses may be only those that are permitted in the district and provided that each establishment shall not exceed 3,000 square feet. The floor area of buildings within the district may be used for more than one permitted use, whether such uses are allowed by right, or by special permit authorized by the zoning board of review; provided, however, that the building and lot meet the most restrictive dimensional requirements applicable to the individual uses. 
    The ground floor of a multiuse building shall be used for allowed commercial uses and as a lobby or access for upper storey uses. Upper stories shall house residential uses, if applicable. 
    304.6.  Public street access. No structure shall be erected on or moved onto a lot which does not have frontage on a public street equal to or greater than the required minimum frontage in table 2, or elsewhere as required in this ordinance, for the district in which it is located, except as permitted in subsections 405.4 and 405.5. For the purpose of this subsection only, and no other purpose, the following named private streets shall be considered to be the equivalent of public streets as defined in subsection 200.136 in order to satisfy the frontage requirements of this subsection: Ivy Avenue, Hawthorn Avenue, Hemlock Avenue, Woodbine Avenue, Promenade Avenue, Janice Road, Laurel Avenue, Amore Road, Lorna Avenue, Claflin Road, Cooper Avenue, Eighth Avenue, Ninth Avenue, Tenth Avenue, Beach Park Avenue, 11th Avenue, 12th Avenue, 13th Avenue, 14th Avenue, 15th Avenue, "A" Avenue, Eddy Court, Adin Court, Ode Court, Clarence Court, Isabel Court, easterly side of Andrew Comstock Road, and Buttonwoods Avenue from Andrew Comstock Road in an easterly direction to its end.

    All commercial trash receptacles and dumpsters are prohibited in all single-family residential zoning districts. Where a trash receptacle or dumpster is used for remodeling, construction of a home, or removal of debris, it shall be allowed for not more than 90 days unless the building official extends such time period. In no event shall the use continue for more than 30 days following the completion of such activity on the property. 
    Temporary storage containers may be permitted as an accessory use in GB, LI, and GI zones provided that there shall be screening in accordance with section 505 of this ordinance. 
    304.9.  Height restrictions around airport. In any district the height of any structure hereafter erected or altered in the vicinity of the Theodore Francis Green Airport shall not exceed the heights indicated in the airport approach plans pursuant to G.L. 1956, § 1-3-4. 
    304.10.  Handicap access residential. Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, appropriate handicap access to residential structures shall be allowed as a reasonable accommodation for any person(s) residing, or intending to reside, in a residential structure.

(F)  Vehicular and pedestrian access points. All developments shall provide the required minimum frontage along an improved and accepted city street. Principal vehicular access for developments of five or more dwelling units shall be from major streets, and access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Merging and turnout lanes as well as traffic dividers shall be provided where existing or anticipated heavy flows indicate need as determined by the planning [sic] director of city plan. In no event shall streets within a planned development connect to streets outside the development in such a way as to encourage use of minor streets for through traffic. 
Access for pedestrians and bicyclists entering or leaving the PDR overlay district shall be so arranged as to provide safe and convenient routes. Such ways need not be adjacent to or limited to the vicinity of vehicular access points. Pedestrian crossings at edges of the development shall be safely located, marked and controlled. Where there is substantial exposure of pedestrian to vehicular traffic at the edges of the district, fences or other barriers shall be erected and maintained to prevent pedestrian crossings except at designated points. Bicycle and/or bridle paths, if provided, shall be coordinated with the pedestrian way system so that bicycle, horse and pedestrian street crossings are combined. 
(G)  Yards. The location of buildings and structures in the PDR overlay district shall be regulated by subsection 308.3, Development standards. Lots located in more than one zoning district shall be regulated by subsection 303.1. 
(H)  Screening. Fences, walls, and/or vegetative screening shall be provided along edges of PDR overlay districts, to protect residents or visitors to such developments from undesirable views, glare, noise or other off-site influences or to protect residents or visitors in adjoining residential districts from similar adverse influences within the PDR overlay district. In both cases, screening shall be designed to control existing or potential adverse views from existing or potential first-floor residential windows in the PDR overlay district or other residential districts. In particular, the following shall be screened: 
(1)  Off-street parking areas containing more than ten parking spaces. When nearest portions of noncontiguous parking areas are separated by less than 50 feet of landscaped space, as measured from their nearest points, they shall be considered as combined for computing the number of spaces.

    308.4.  Density increase. It is the intent of this subsection to limit PDR overlay district densities to the maximum allowances set forth in subsection 308.3. However, it is recognized that in certain instances, as described below, an increase in the maximum densities permitted may be desirable. Upon recommendation of the director of city plan and based upon subsection 103, Purpose, of this ordinance, the city council may permit a density increase as follows. Up to a 15 percent increase in dwelling units over the maximum density allowance set forth in subsection 308.3 may be permitted if the city council shall have determined compliance with one or more of the following listed in [subsections] (A) through (C) below. Up to a 30 percent increase is permitted if the city council shall have determined compliance with [subsection] (D) below. Any combination of [subsections] (A) through (C) with [subsection] (D) cannot exceed said 30 percent increase. In determining the appropriate percent increase, the city council shall review the recommendation of the director of city plan as to the extent of compliance with any or any combination of [subsections] (A) through (D). 
(A)  Provision of elderly housing for at least 80 percent of the dwelling units. (With parking requirement of one parking space per dwelling unit.) 
(B)  Provision of low and moderate income housing whereby not less than 25 percent of the total number of dwelling units shall be rented or sold at a rate or price below market levels. 
(C)  Provision of publicly accessible easements for pedestrians, bicyclists, bus shelters on private property, and other public amenities deemed desirable for the public enjoyment, convenience and welfare. 
(D)  Adaptive reuse of historically and/or architecturally significant buildings, particularly mill type industrial buildings proposed to be adapted for housing.

309. - Overlay district regulations-Planned unit development (PUD). 
    The planned unit development (PUD) overlay districts are established in accordance with section 302.4 of this ordinance and may be enacted from time to time by amendments to this ordinance consisting of appropriate changes in the boundaries of districts in such a manner as best to fit the general pattern of land use established by the comprehensive plan and this ordinance and to further the purposes set forth in section 100. PUD overlay districts are intended to encourage mixed use developments involving residential, commercial, and industrial uses in areas that are specifically designated for such uses and in strict accordance with the requirements contained in this subsection. Such districts may be created by action of the city council as amendments to the zoning map, on application and approval of specific and detailed plans, where tracts suitable in location and character are planned, and shall be classified as planned unit development. 
    309.1.  Administrative procedure. See subsection 305. 
    309.2.  Minimum lot area required. The minimum required area for a planned unit development shall be ten acres on one or more contiguous lots that are not separated by a public right-of-way and that are in the same ownership. The minimum area shall be calculated in accordance with subsection 200.92. 
    309.3.  Development standards. Any residential use permitted within a PUD shall be subject to the maximum density allowances of subsection 308.3, Development standards for PDR. The underlying district shall determine the appropriate density, as for PDR. Density increases as provided in subsection 308.4 may also apply to this subsection. Other requirements concerning dimensions, parking, landscaping, and any additional requirements of this ordinance shall be met to the fullest extent possible. However, the city council, at its discretion and based on the purposes of the PUD overlay district in subsection 302.4, may allow variances from the terms of such dimensional requirements. 
    309.4.  Residential PUD. Planned unit development projects are eligible for consideration within all residence districts. The mixture of uses shall include residential as the principal use, combined with other uses as follows: 
Permitted Use Maximum Gross Floor Area (GFA) (1) Residential Allowable in subsection 308.3 with Retail and/or Office 25% of residential GFA Industrial 0%  
Office and retail gross floor area in any combination shall not exceed 25 percent of the maximum allowable gross floor area. 
    309.5.  Office PUD. Planned unit development projects are eligible for consideration within the office district. The mixture of uses shall be either office or residential as the principal use, combined with other uses as follows: 
Permitted Use Maximum Gross Floor Area (GFA) (1) Office Allowable in O district with Retail or (2) Residential 25% of office GFA Allowable in subsection 308.3 with Office and/or Retail 25% of residential GFA Industrial 0%

Office and retail gross floor area in any combination shall not exceed 25 percent of the maximum allowable gross floor area. 
    309.7.  Light and general industrial PUD. Planned unit development projects are eligible for consideration within the light and general industrial districts. The mixture of uses shall include industrial or office as the major use, combined with other uses as follows: 
Permitted Use Maximum Gross Floor Area (GFA) (1) Industrial or Office Allowable in LI or GI districts with Retail 25% of industrial or office GFA Residential 0%  
Retail gross floor area shall not exceed 25 percent of the maximum allowable gross floor area in a PUD with primarily industrial or office use. 
    309.8.  Other districts. PUD's are expressly prohibited in open space and waterfront business districts. 
310. - Overlay district regulations-Flood hazard (AE, VE). 
    310.1.  Intent. Flood hazard overlay districts are established to protect lives and property from natural devastation caused by flooding from hurricanes and other such storm activity. Flood hazard overlay districts include the land area of the city which is subject to inundation by the 100-year flood, designated as zones AE or VE and as provided in subsection 303 of this ordinance. 
    310.2.  Development permit required. Within the flood hazard overlay district defined in subsection 310.1, a development permit shall be obtained from the building official for any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate including, but not limited to, mining, building or other structures, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. Applicants for development permits within the flood hazard overlay district shall supply the following information to the building official: 
(A)  Accurate location of the proposed development; 
(B)  Nature of the proposed development including types of activities proposed, areas to be disturbed, and quantities of materials to be excavated, moved or filled; 
(C)  Elevation(s) of the site of the proposed development relative to mean sea level datum; 
(D)  A Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Flood Insurance Program elevation certificate shall be submitted at the completion of foundation; and 
(E)  A description of the extent to which any existing watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development. 
    Development permit applications will be reviewed to assure that the proposed development will be reasonably safe from flooding, to assure that the flood-carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse will be maintained, and to assure that the requirements of subsections 310.4, 310.5 and 310.6, as applicable, are met. Prior to approving applications for the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, the building official shall cause notification of adjacent communities, the Rhode Island department of administration, division of planning, or its appropriate successor agency, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or its appropriate successor agency. 
    310.3.  Floodways adopted. Floodways are those portions of the flood hazard overlay district which must be reserved in order to discharge the 100-year flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot at any point. The floodway areas designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the "Floodway Boundary Map-City of Warwick, Rhode Island, March 15, 1982" or any amendment thereto are incorporated in the "zoning plat" in accordance with section 303 of this ordinance and are the areas to which the floodway encroachment regulations of subsection 310.4 of this ordinance shall apply. 
    310.4.  Floodway encroachment prohibited. No development proposing fill, new construction, substantial improvement or other encroachment within a floodway as defined and adopted in subsection 310.3 shall be issued a development permit unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the building official that the proposed development will not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the 100-year flood. 
    310.5.  Flood zone (AE) areas designation. Flood zone (AE) areas are defined as those areas within the flood hazard overlay district that correspond with the 100-year floodplain as designated in section 303 of this ordinance. 
    310.6.  Velocity (VE) zone areas designated. Velocity (VE) zone areas are defined as those areas within the flood hazard overlay district that are located along the city's coastline which are subject to high-velocity waters from hurricane wave wash and wave run-up as designated on the "zoning plat" as provided in section 303 of this ordinance. 
    310.7.  Velocity (VE) zone development requirements. Within all velocity (VE) zone areas as designated in subsection 310.6, the following requirements shall apply to any proposed development in addition to all other requirements applicable under this ordinance: 
(A)  The alteration of sand dunes, where existent, is prohibited; 
(B)  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
311. - Overlay district regulations-Historic (H). 
    This subsection is intended to create historic overlay district(s) for the purpose of preserving structures and sites of historic, architectural, and archaeological value by regulating the construction, alteration, repair, removal or demolition of such structures and sites. Within historic overlay districts now existing or hereafter created, it is intended that such historic overlay districts be permitted in general areas or for individual structures and premises officially designated as having historic significance. However, written permission must be obtained from the property owner for the historic overlay district designation for individual structures or lots which do not abut any other lots in an historic overlay district. 
    311.1.  District boundaries. The historic overlay districts are established as shown on the "zoning plat" as provided in section 303 of this ordinance, and include those areas established by request of the owner and those areas established by the city council through enactment of amendments to the "zoning plat." 
    311.2.  Historic district commission. 
(A)  Establishment. There is hereby established a historic district commission to carry out the purposes of subsections 311 through 311.5 of this ordinance. 
(B)  Membership and appointment. The historic district commission shall consist of seven qualified members who are residents or [of] the City of Warwick. The appointed members of said commission shall be appointed for three-year terms except the initial appointments of some of the members shall be for less than three years to the end that the initial appointments shall be staggered and so that subsequent appointments shall not recur at the same time. 
    311.3.  Powers, duties, and application procedures of the historic district commission. 
(A)  Certificate of appropriateness required. Before a property owner may authorize or commence construction, alteration, repair, removal or demolition affecting the exterior appearance of a structure or its appurtenances within a historic overlay district, the owner must apply for and receive a certificate of appropriateness from the commission. In applying for a certificate of appropriateness, a property owner must comply with application procedures as established by the commission pursuant to G.L. 1956, § 45-24.1-1 et seq., as amended, and the provisions of this ordinance. A certificate of appropriateness is necessary only if a building permit is required for such construction, alteration, repair, removal, or demolition. The building official shall not issue a building permit until the commission has granted a certificate of appropriateness. 
(B)  Applications for certificates of appropriateness. Said applications shall contain information which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the proposed construction, alteration, repair, removal, or demolition, including but not limited to plans, drawings, photographs or other information, and it shall be filed with the commission at the office of the department of city plan. A determination shall be made in accordance with the commission's rules and regulations as to completeness. Incomplete applications shall be returned to the applicant within ten working days of receipt by the planning department. 
(C)  Application and plan review. In reviewing the application and plans, the commission shall give consideration to: 
(1)  The historic and architectural significance of the structure and its appurtenances; 
(2)  The way in which the structure and its appurtenances contribute to the historical and architectural significance of the district; and 
(3)  The appropriateness of the general design, arrangement, texture, material and siting proposed in the plans. 
The commission shall pass only on exterior features of a structure and its appurtenances and shall not consider interior arrangements. 
(D)  [ Decisions. ] All decisions of the commission shall be in writing. The commission shall articulate and explain the reasons and basis of each decision on a record, and in the case of a decision not to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall include the basis for its conclusion that the proposed activity would be incongruous with those aspects of the structure, to be historically or architecturally significant. The commission shall send a copy of the decision to the applicant. 
The mayor shall have the right to name an auxiliary member to the commission in addition to the regular members, which auxiliary member shall sit as an active member, upon the request of the chairperson of the commission, when and if a regular member of the commission is unable to serve at any meeting of the commission. Appointed members of the commission shall be eligible for reappointment and [sic] upon the expiration of their term and shall continue to serve until replaced. In the event of a vacancy on the commission, the mayor may make interim appointment(s) of appointed members, with the consent of the city council, for the remainder of the unexpired term. 
Members of the commission shall have a demonstrated interest in historic preservation and may be from but not limited to the following professions and disciplines; history, archeology, architecture, art and architectural history, and social and economic history. Duly organized and existing preservation societies may present to the mayor lists of qualified citizens to be considered for appointment. 
(E)  Organization. The commission shall organize annually and elect from its membership a chairperson, vice-chairperson and secretary and shall adopt and publish all rules and regulations necessary to carry out its functions under this ordinance. The commission shall also adopt and publish standards of review (which shall be in harmony with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, 36 CFR 671, as amended), within 12 months following the adoption of this ordinance to inform historic district residents, property owners, and the general public of those criteria by which the commission shall determine whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness. The commission may from time to time amend these standards as reasonably necessary, and it shall publish all such amendments. 
At least four members of the commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of its business. The commission shall adopt rules for the transaction of its business which shall provide for the time and place of holding regular meetings. They shall provide for the calling of special meetings by the chairperson. The commission shall provide notice of its meetings and comply in all respects with requirements of the state Open Meetings Law. All meetings of the commission shall be open to the public, and any person or his duly constituted representative shall be entitled to appear and be heard on any matter before the commission before it reaches its decision. 
The commission shall keep a record, which shall be open to public inspection, of its resolutions, proceedings, findings, decisions and actions. The concurring vote of four members shall constitute approval of plans before it for review, or for the adoption of any resolution, motion, or other action of the commission. The concurring vote of four members shall be necessary for disapproval. The commission shall submit an annual report of its activities to the mayor and city council. 
(F)  [ Rejection of application. ] In the case of application for construction, repair, alteration, removal, or demolition affecting the exterior appearance of a structure or its appurtenances, which the commission deems so valuable to the city, state or nation, the commission shall endeavor to work out with the owner an economically feasible plan for the preservation of such structure. Unless the historic district commission is satisfied that the retention of such structure constitutes a hazard to public safety, which hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the owner, including the conveyance of such structure to any purchaser willing to preserve such structure, the commission shall file with the building official its rejection of such application. 
In the absence of change in such structure arising from casualty, no new application for the same or similar work shall be filed within one year after such rejection. 
(G)  [ Approval of application. ] In the case of any structure deemed to be valuable for the period of architecture it represents, and important to the neighborhood within which it exists, the historic district commission may file with the building official its certificate of appropriateness for such application if any of the circumstances under which a certificate of appropriateness might have been given under the preceding paragraph (F) are in existence or if: 
(1)  Preservation of such structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of substantial benefit to the community. 
(2)  Preservation of such structure would cause undue or unreasonable financial hardship to the owner, taking into account the financial resources available to the owner including sale of the structure to any purchaser willing to preserve such structure. 
(3)  Preservation of such structure would not be in the best interest of the majority of the community. 
When considering an application to demolish or remove a structure of historic or architectural value, the commission shall assist the owner in identifying and evaluating alternatives to demolition, including sale of the structure on its present site. In addition to any other criteria, the commission also shall consider whether there is a reasonable likelihood that some person or group other than the current owner is willing to purchase, move and preserve such structure and whether the owner has made continuing bona fide and reasonable efforts to sell the structure to any such purchaser willing to move and preserve such structure. 
(H)  [ Consultants; expenditures. ] The historic district commission shall have the power to call in additional experts to aid it in its deliberations. Expenditures of the historic commission shall be limited to amounts appropriated for its use. 
(I)  [ Advice to city agencies. ] In order to assist the city, its agencies, boards, commissions, staff, mayor and city council on matters of historic preservation, the historic district commission may provide its expertise and advice as appropriate. 
    311.4.  Certificate of appropriateness or rejection of plans. The historic district commission shall file with the building official its certificate of appropriateness or rejection of all plans submitted to it for review. No work shall begin until such certificate shall have been filed, but in the case of rejection, such certificate shall be binding upon the building official and no permit shall be issued in such case. The failure of the historic district commission to act within 45 days from the day of application filed with it unless an extension is agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the historic district commission shall be deemed to constitute approval. In the event, however, that the historic district commission shall make a finding of fact, that the circumstances of a particular application require further time for additional study and information than can be obtained within the aforesaid period of 45 days, then and in said event the historic district commission shall have a period of up to 90 days within which to act upon such application. 
    311.5.  Exception to application of this subsection. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent painting, routine maintenance or repair of any structure within a historic overlay district, provided that such maintenance or repair does not result in any change of design, type of material, or appearance of the structure or appurtenance; nor shall anything in this ordinance be construed to prevent the construction, alteration, repair, moving, or demolition of any structure under a permit issued by the building official prior to the passage of this ordinance. 
    311.6-311.9.  Reserved. 
    311.10.  Stone walls. The city's stone walls are a tangible link to the city's colonial and agrarian past and, as such, hold a unique historic significance for the city. This historic resource is continuously threatened by both private and public development pressures which have and will result in their destruction unless they are protected from such development pressures. 
(A)  Definition. A stone wall for the purposes of this section is defined as a vertical structure of aligned natural stone, normally constructed to designate a property boundary between farmsteads or segregate agricultural activities within a single farmstead during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. 
(B)  Restrictions pertaining to altering stone walls. 
1.  The historic district commission must approve any alterations to: 
(a)  Stone walls flanking city or state roads within the municipal boundaries of the city. Any alteration of said walls shall require a certificate of appropriateness from the historic district commission. 
(b)  Stone walls that will be altered or demolished as part of construction of a subdivision. In such instances, a certificate of appropriateness issued by the historic district commission for alterations to said wall(s) shall be a condition of any subdivision approval(s). 
2.  Walls exempted from review: 
(a)  Contemporary stone walls. Those constructed after 1900 with the exception of those walls identified as a significant component of a property listed on, or found to be eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places. 
3.  Stone walls in disrepair or in neglected condition may not be removed for the sake of convenience from their present location but must be repaired or left as is. Exceptions to this prohibition are: 
(a)  Walls posing a threat to the public health and safety. In the case of a wall whose condition represents a real and immediate threat to the public health and safety, the historic district commission shall issue an order to the property owner to stabilize and repair said wall. If said property owner does not make a good faith effort to correct the problem within 20 business days of notification of said problem by the historic district commission, said commission shall have the option to undertake said repairs and place a lien on the subject property to recover the cost of said repairs. 
4.  When relocation of a stone wall is the only viable alternative, said wall's reconstruction shall match that of the original wall. If the existing wall is of drywall construction, a reconstructed wall shall be of either drywall or hidden cement construction. 
5.  Procedure for obtaining permission to alter a stone wall. 
(a)  Requests for a certificate of appropriateness to alter or relocate a stone wall shall be submitted in writing to the historic district commission. Each request shall include: 
(1)  A plan showing the proposed work and the extent of the alteration and/or demolition along with photographs of the existing wall. 
(2)  A description of the alteration and the reasons for the change. 
(3)  A list of property owners located within a 200 foot radius of the alteration. 
(b)  The historic district commission shall review each request to insure compliance with the provisions of this section. The historic district commission shall approve, disapprove or approve with conditions requests for altering stone walls. 
(Ord. No. O-12-92, § I, 7-21-92) 
312. - Overlay district regulations-Watershed protection (WP). 
    It is the intent of this subsection to provide regulations for the development and implementation of an overlay district for the purpose of protecting an environmentally sensitive water body from levels of pollution that have been found to threaten public health, safety, welfare and/or use.

SECTION 400. - NONCONFORMANCE 

401. - General application. 
    A nonconformance is a building, structure, sign, or parcel of land, or use thereof, which was lawfully existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this zoning ordinance, and not in conformity with the provisions of such ordinance or amendment. 
    401.1.  Lawfully existing or established. A building, structure, sign, or parcel of land, or use thereof, was lawfully existing or lawfully established if it was in existence prior to March 22, 1957, or was established in conformance with the zoning ordinance in effect at the time the use was first established. For the purposes of this ordinance, the placement or use of a sign, with or without any other structure or use, is considered a use of land. A lot was lawfully existing or lawfully established if it was of record or shown on a recorded plat prior to March 27, 1957 and was separately owned. 
    401.2.  Prior illegal establishment. Any use or structure illegally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance or any amendment thereto shall not be granted nonconformance status nor shall it become legally established subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance or any amendment thereto. 
    401.3.  Nonconforming by use. A lawfully established use of land, building, or structure which is not a permitted use in the zoning district in which it is located, as set forth in section 300, is nonconforming by use. 
    401.4.  Nonconforming by dimension. A lawfully established building, structure, or parcel of land not in compliance with the dimensional regulations of this ordinance is nonconforming by dimension. Dimensional regulations include all regulations of this ordinance, other than those pertaining to the permitted uses. A lawfully established building, structure, parcel of land, or use thereof, not in compliance with the parking regulations of this ordinance, as set forth in section 700, is also nonconforming by dimension. A lawfully existing or lawfully established lot that is not in compliance with the dimensional regulations of the zoning ordinance, including, but not limited to, those regulations for minimum lot size, lot width and lot frontage (also known as a substandard lot of record), is also nonconforming by dimension. 
    401.5.  Nonconforming by dwelling units. A building or structure containing more dwelling units than are permitted by the use regulations of this ordinance shall be nonconforming by use. A building or structure containing a permitted number of dwelling units by the use regulations of this zoning ordinance, but not meeting the lot area per dwelling unit regulations, shall be nonconforming by dimension. 
    401.6.  Most restrictive regulations to apply. A building, structure or parcel of land nonconforming by more than one factor, such as by use, dimension, area or parking, shall comply with all regulations of this section. Where the regulations conflict, the most restrictive regulations shall apply. 
    401.7.  Existence by variance or special use permit. A nonconforming building, structure, sign, or parcel of land or the use thereof, which exists by virtue of a variance or a special use permit (or a special exception) granted by the board, shall not be considered a nonconformance for the purposes of this section, and shall not acquire the rights of this section. Rather, such building, structure, sign, parcel of land, or use thereof, shall be considered a use by variance or a use by special use permit and any moving, addition, enlargement, expansion, intensification or change of such building, structure, sign, parcel of land or use thereof, to any use other than a permitted use or other than in complete conformance with this ordinance, shall require a further variance or special use permit from the board. 
402. - Building or structure nonconforming by use. 
    Nonconforming uses are incompatible with and detrimental to permitted uses in the zoning districts in which they are located. Nonconforming uses cause disruption of the comprehensive land use pattern of the city, inhibit present and future development of nearby properties, and confer upon their owners a position of unfair advantage. It is intended that existing nonconforming uses shall not justify further departures from this ordinance for themselves, or for any other properties. 
    402.1.  Treatment in residential zones. Nonconforming uses in residential zones are to be treated in a stricter fashion than nonconforming uses located in nonresidential zones. Due to the disruption which nonconforming uses cause to the peace and tranquility of a residential zone, nonconforming uses therein should be eventually abolished or reduced to total conformity over time. 
    402.2.  Continuance of use. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent or be construed to prevent the continuance of a nonconforming use of any building or structure for any purpose to which such building or structure was lawfully established. 
    402.3.  Maintenance and repair. A building or structure containing a nonconforming use may be maintained and repaired except as otherwise provided in this section. 
    402.4.  Moving. A building or structure containing a nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part either on or off the lot on which it is located unless the use contained within such building or structure is made to conform to the use regulations of the zone in which it is relocated. 
    402.5.  Addition and enlargement. A building or structure containing a nonconforming use shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner, including any addition or enlargement of floor area or volume, unless the use contained within such building or structure, including such addition and enlargement, is made to conform to the use regulations of the zone in which it is located. 
    402.6.  Expansion. A nonconforming use of a building or structure shall not be expanded into any other portion of the building or structure which contains a conforming use or which is unoccupied or unused. 
    402.7.  Intensification. A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land shall not be intensified in any manner. Intensification shall include, but not be limited to, increasing hours of operation, increasing the number of dwelling units or increasing the seating capacity of a place of assembly. However, this section shall not prohibit the reconfiguration of existing dwelling units within a building or structure so long as such reconfiguration complies with the requirements of subsection 402.6. 
    402.8.  Change of use. 
(A)  Residential zones. Within any residential zone, a nonconforming use shall only be changed to a permitted use or to the same actual use. A nonconforming use, if changed to a permitted use, may not be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
(B)  Nonresidential zones. Within any nonresidential zone, a nonconforming use may be changed to a permitted use, or to the same use code listed under section 300. A nonconforming use, if changed to a permitted use, may not be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
    402.9.  Abandonment. If a nonconforming use is abandoned, it may not be reestablished. Abandonment of a nonconforming use shall consist of some overt act, or failure to act, which would lead one to believe that the owner of the nonconforming use neither claims nor retains any interest in continuing the nonconforming use unless the owner can demonstrate an intent not to abandon the use. An involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, such as by fire and natural catastrophe, does not establish the intent to abandon the nonconforming use. However, if any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one year or more, the owner of the nonconforming use will be presumed to have abandoned the nonconforming use, unless that presumption is rebutted by the presentation of sufficient evidence of intent not to abandon the use. 
403. - Building or structure nonconforming by dimension. 
    Buildings or structures that are nonconforming by dimension are likely to cause overcrowding and congestion in the neighborhoods, contribute to unhealthy conditions and are contrary to the purposes of this ordinance.

The total fee for the third party peer review shall be paid by the applicant before the application receives final approval. 
    507.2. Design regulations for alterations and enlargements of existing buildings, parking areas and/or landscaping. All exterior improvements on existing buildings in the WSDD are subject to approval by the administrative officer or planning board and shall be regulated by these standards and guidelines except for those activities listed in section 507.1(b) administrative approval. The purpose of these regulations and the WSDD Design Manual is to establish design criteria to create and maintain the architectural and landscape features of the district envisioned in the Warwick Station Development District Master Plan. 
(a)  Minimum standards. The following are minimum standards for the design of alterations or additions to existing buildings: 
(1)  Design. Alterations and additions to existing buildings shall follow the design standards defined within the Warwick Station Development District Master Plan and further detailed within the WSDD Design Manual. All designs shall be compatible with the size, scale, massing, proportion, material, and other features and environmental setting of a pedestrian-scaled urban development. 
(2)  Additions and alterations. Wherever possible, additions or alterations to buildings, structures, and appurtenances shall be designed in a manner that transforms existing buildings to conform to the character of the district in compliance with the standards for new construction listed in section 507.3. 
(3)  Exterior lighting and glare. All exterior lighting shall be designed to minimize negative impacts on neighboring properties. Night sky pollution shall be controlled by downshaded lighting or shielded lighting. All lighting shall be based upon a pedestrian scale appropriate for the Warwick Station Development District setting. Glare from outdoor lights and signs and from the movement of vehicles on site shall be shielded from the view of adjacent residential properties. 
(4)  Landscaping and screening. Landscaping and screening requirements for the Warwick Station Intermodal and Gateway Districts. It is the intent of this subsection to require that properties within the Warwick Station Intermodal and Gateway Districts be suitably landscaped and screened in order to provide for attractive and well maintained development in accordance with section 103, purpose of this ordinance. All uses in the Warwick Station Intermodal and Gateway Districts shall comply with the minimum standards contained in section 505, landscaping and screening requirements for nonresidential uses; the landscaping and screening requirements specified in section 700, parking and loading; as well as the guidelines found in the WSDD Design Manual. 
    507.3. Design regulations for new construction, parking, landscaping, stormwater control, and signage. All new construction in the WSDD is subject to approval by the planning board and shall be regulated by these standards and guidelines as well as those defined within the Warwick Station Development District Master Plan, the WSDD Design Manual, and sections 505.2 through 505.5 and 505.7 of section 505, landscaping and screening requirements for nonresidential uses, except for those activities listed in subsection 507.1(b) administrative approval. The purpose of these regulations is to establish design criteria to create a development district which is pedestrian in scale and to ensure that new construction is consistent with the WSDD Master Plan. 
(a)  Minimum standards. The following are minimum standards for all new construction projects. 
(1)  Design. Buildings, structures and site layout, shall be visually compatible with the character contained in the Warwick Station Development District Master Plan and the surrounding area, including building materials, massing, scale, building roof lines, and site furnishings. 
(2)  Architectural elements. Architectural elements should be in proportion to the overall building and should also be congruent with the surrounding building context. Exaggerated or excessively large (or small) architectural elements should be avoided. Development projects should reuse existing buildings of historical significance whenever possible. 
(3)  Scale. Large scale development may be encouraged in appropriate areas, but pedestrian level streetscapes shall be included as an integral design element. Conventional suburban-oriented, individual structures with a single entrance set back on a large expanse of asphalt parking are prohibited. New buildings should not be single story, large, bulky masses, but should be verticla in orientation and multi-storied. 
(4)  Vehicular access. Proposed site layout shall limit direct access to collector and arterial roadways and shall provide safe ingress and egress from local roads and private drives by providing a sufficient number and control of access points including adequate site distances, turning lanes and signalization when required by existing and projected traffic flow. The planning board may require consolidation of existing curb cuts into fewer clearly defined entrances. The planning board may also require shared access between developments where practicable. No development shall be allowed where there is unrestricted access to public streets or roadways or where a public street must be utilized to maneuver in and out of a parking space. Provisions shall be made for providing and maintaining safe and convenient emergency vehicle access to all buildings and structures at all times. 
(5)  Parking. New construction shall conform to section 700, off-street parking and loading, except for the parking reductions prescribed below:

Parking structures may be required to satisfy parking space requirements. Due to the pedestrian nature of the Intermodal zone and the use of the Interlink between the Intermodal facility and the airport terminal, the planning board may limit the number of parking spaces provided for each use within the WSDD. In addition, the planning board may limit the ingress and egress points of parking facilities to side streets to ensure that traffic congestion is mitigated so that collector and arterial roadways are not adversely impacted. 
(6)  Circulation. The design of the project circulation system shall be inclusive of all transportation choices and relate to planned improvements in the area, including future walkways, street widening, realignments, or paving programs which have been planned or scheduled for construction. The design shall be consistent with corridor improvement designs encouraged within the Warwick Station Development District Master Plan and WSDD Design Manual and promote convenient and safe pedestrian and bicycle transit accessible to all. Small scaled interior streets and drives, alleyways, public spaces, and pedestrian paths shall be encouraged within the district. Such interior circulation shall link to an overall system envisioned in the Warwick Station Development District Master Plan. 
(7)  View corridors. Views of significant features such as the new intermodal station, the Elizabeth Mill and the Airport terminal shall be preserved whenever possible. 
(8)  Utilities. New development shall not impose unreasonable burdens on sanitary sewers, storm-drains, water lines, roadway systems and other public utilities and may be subject to impact studies in accordance with the Warwick Development Review Regulations. Developers shall be responsible for all improvements and upgrades resulting form a proposed development. All utilities shall be underground. 
a)  Public water. All new construction must utilize the City of Warwick water system. Sufficient public water supply must be available for a proposed development and shall not result in an unreasonable burden on the existing water supply. 
b)  Sewage disposal. All new construction must utilize the City of Warwick sanitary sewer system. Sufficient sewer capacity must be available throughout the sewer system for a proposed development and shall not result in an unreasonable burden on the existing sewer system. 
c)  Stormwater run-off and erosion control. Adequate provisions shall be made for stormwater runoff so that removal of surface water shall not adversely affect neighboring properties, downstream water quality, soil erosion or the storm-drain system. Whenever possible, on site underground infiltration systems shall be utilized to eliminate discharges from the site. 
1.  Erosion and sedimentation shall be controlled during and after construction and shall not adversely affect adjacent or neighboring property or public facilities and services. All erosion control shall meet the standards of the City of Warwick and the Rhode Island Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook. 
2.  All stormwater control shall meet the standards of the Rhode Island Storm-water Design and Installation Standards Manual and Section D.2.7 "Drainage" as contained in the City of Warwick Development Review Regulations. Such stormwater control shall be integral to the landscape design of the project. 
c)  Traffic impact. Proposed developments shall not impose unreasonable burdens on the circulation system of the district or surrounding areas. Public roadways inadequate to handle the volume of traffic generated by the development shall be improved by the applicant to provide safe, efficient passage for vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. Developers may be required to provide a traffic impact report prepared by a certified traffic engineer as authorized in the development review regulations. 
(9)  Security. In the case of significant projects having a substantial impact upon the district, the city, or the surrounding area, the planning board shall require a performance guarantee in accordance with the Warwick Development Review Regulations ensuring that the project will be completed in accordance with the approved plans and any conditions imposed. 
(10)  Signs. The size, location, design, lighting and materials of all exterior signs and outdoor advertising structures shall be compatible with the design of proposed buildings, structures and surrounding properties. The planning board may limit the size and number of signs for any property, provided however, that at least one sign for each nonresidential lot which meets the standards of the City of Warwick Zoning Ordinance shall be allowed. 
(11)  Special features. Exposed storage areas, exposed machinery, service areas, loading areas, utility buildings and similar structures shall have sufficient setbacks and screening to provide an audio and visual buffer designed to minimize adverse impacts on surrounding properties. 
(12)  Exterior lighting and glare. All exterior lighting shall be designed to minimize negative impacts on neighboring properties. Night sky pollution shall be controlled by downshaded lighting or shielded lighting. All lighting shall be based upon a pedestrian scale appropriate for the Warwick Station Development District setting. Glare from outdoor lights and signs and from the movement of vehicles on site shall be shielded from the view of adjacent residential properties. 
    507.4 Demolition. In order to create the appropriate architectural and landscape character envisioned in the Warwick Station Development District Master Plan, no building shall be demolished until the planning board has granted a demolition permit. 
(1)  Review of application. In reviewing an application for demolition, the planning board shall consider the architectural quality of the existing building and the quality of the site and shall review the proposed landscaping and/or new building to be constructed. 
(2)  Grant of demolition. A demolition permit shall not be issued until the applicant demonstrates adequate financial ability to demolish the existing structure and landscape the site or construct a new building on the site. The planning board may require a performance guarantee to ensure that all work approved in the grant of demolition is satisfactorily completed. 
(Ord. No. O-12-6, § I(Exh. A), 1-19-12) 
508. - Additional regulations for the village district.

SECTION 700. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

701. - Parking requirements. 
    No land shall be used or occupied and no structure shall be erected or used unless the off-street parking spaces required herein are provided. Such parking spaces are not required for any structure or use existing prior to the effective date of this ordinance or any amendment thereto, with parking space that does not meet the requirements of this ordinance; provided however, that parking spaces as specified in this ordinance shall be provided subject to the requirements of this section 700 for any enlargement, alteration or change to any such existing structure or use. While it is the intent of this section to require minimum off-street parking and loading facilities, excessive paving of land that supplies significantly more than the minimum numbers of spaces is discouraged. Moreover, the number of curb cuts to provide ingress and egress to parking surface lots from any street shall be the minimum required to insure the safety of motorists and pedestrians. Wherever applicable, access to parking shall be from major nonresidential streets with no or minimal access from residential streets. Drive-through windows shall be accessed by a minimum of 11-foot travel lanes with a minimum overhead clearance of 14 feet. There shall be no stacking of vehicles on any public street. Entrances and exits shall be properly signed. 
    701.1.  Location of required parking spaces. The off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance shall be on the same lot as the structure or use they are intended to serve or on an abutting lot provided that such off-street parking spaces for business or industrial uses shall not be located in any residence or open space district where such business or industrial use is prohibited in such residence or open space district in table 1, Use Regulations. Upon application to the zoning board of review, a special use permit pursuant to subsection 906 of this ordinance may be granted by the board to allow off-street parking on other off-site lots in nonresidential districts provided that the following conditions are met in addition to the requirements of subsection 906: 
    Other off-site parking location is: 
(A)  Within 100 feet of the boundary of the lot of the principal use or structure; and/or 
(B)  Reasonably and safely accessible, in the opinion of the zoning board of review, either by pedestrians or other means such as tram and/or shuttle service, provided however that such off-site locations shall not substantially injure the use and enjoyment of nor significantly devalue neighboring property; and that the approval of the off-site location will not be detrimental to the general health and welfare of the community. 
    701.2.  Minimum size of parking spaces. Each parking space shall be marked by pavement lines and contain the following minimum dimensions affecting the width and length of individual parking stalls and the width of aisles in all districts, exclusive of necessary drives and other accessways. A driveway may be considered a required parking space only for a detached single-family dwelling and need not contain pavement lines. 
Minimum width  9 feet Minimum length 18 feet Minimum aisle width: 90-degree angle 24 feet 60-degree angle 18 feet 45-degree angle 13 feet 30-degree angle 11 feet 0 degrees (parallel parking) 12 feet

No parking space or aisle shall be less than five feet from any building, except where greater setbacks are required by subsection 308.2(D) or subsection 502.3(C). Parking spaces less than ten feet from any building shall be separated from such building by raised curb, bumper or wheel guards. The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to detached single-family dwellings. 
    701.4.  Entrance and exit. Each parking space shall be designed with adequate off-street area for approach, turning, and exit without the need or ability to use any part of a street. All driveways shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width for each lane of traffic using such driveway. However the width of any driveway shall not exceed 30 feet. No driveway shall be within 20 feet of another driveway. The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to detached single-family dwellings except that, for such uses, the width of any driveway shall not exceed 30 feet. 
    701.5.  Shared parking. No part of an off-street parking area required for any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this section shall be included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly required for another building or use unless allowed by the zoning board of review as a special exception pursuant to subsection 906 of this ordinance and provided that the board determines that the type of structures or uses indicate that the period of usage of such structures or uses will not be simultaneous. 
    701.6.  Construction requirements. Every parcel of land which, after the effective date of this ordinance or any amendment thereto, is changed to a parking area for more than ten vehicles, or to a drive-in business or motor vehicle sales or service establishment shall be developed as follows, subject to the approval of plans thereof by the director of public works.

The interior circulation system shall be designed to provide safe and convenient access to all structures, uses and/or parking spaces; parking areas shall be protected with suitable guards, rails, islands, crosswalks, speed bumps, and similar devises deemed necessary by the Warwick Station Redevelopment Agency. The layout and design of vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives and parking areas, shall provide for safe general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, service traffic, loading areas, and arrangement and use of parking areas. 
(A)  Parking lots shall be located behind, beneath or within commercial buildings. 
(B)  Whenever possible, surface level parking lots on adjoining commercial lots shall be connected internally to each other to allow for through traffic between and reducing the need for multiple curb cuts. 
(C)  Parking lots containing ten or more spaces shall be planted with at least one tree per three spaces, no smaller than two inches caliper and at least five feet in height at the time of planting and shall be of a species characterized by hardiness within the area.

Up to 25 percent of the off-street parking space requirement may be satisfied by on-street parking within the frontage width of the building lot. New parking areas shall have a minimum driveway/travel width of 22 feet for two way travel and 11 feet for one way travel. Parking spaces shall be a minimum of 9'×18', compact spaces may be approved, if determined to be appropriate. 
F.  Off-street parking for residential uses in the district shall be provided onsite at the rate of one parking space per bedroom in each residential unit, up to a maximum of two off-street spaces per unit. 
G.  Wherever possible, parking lots on adjacent commercial lots shall be connected internally to allow through-traffic and to reduce the need for multiple curb cuts.

(i)  All owners of the subject property in question; and 
(ii)  All property owners of record of land within 200 feet of the property, which is the subject of the application, whether within the city or within an adjacent city or town, provided however, if the subject property is zoned Residential A-40 or if more than 50 percent of the number of parcels which are residentially zoned land within the 200 foot radius of the subject property are zoned Residential A-40, then notice shall be sent to all property owners of record within 400 feet of the property; provided further however, if the only relief sought in the application is a dimensional variance for a single-family house lot, then notice shall only be sent to property owners of record within 200 feet of the property, without regard to the percent of A-40 parcels within the 200 foot radius; and 
(iii)  The member of the Warwick City Council in such ward as the subject property is located; and

    906.3.  Standards for relief. 
(A)  All variances. In granting a variance, the board shall require that evidence to the satisfaction of the following standards be entered into the record of the proceedings: 
(1)  That the hardship from which the applicant seeks relief is due to the unique characteristics of the subject land or structure and not the general characteristics of the surrounding area, and is not due to the physical or economic disability of the applicant (For handicapped access. See section 304.10) 
(2)  That said hardship is not the result of any prior action of the applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the applicant to realize greater financial gain; 
(3)  That the granting of the requested variance will not alter the general characteristic of the surrounding area or impair the intent or purpose of this zoning ordinance or the comprehensive plan of the city; 
(4)  That the relief to be granted is the least relief necessary. 
(B)  Different standards for use and dimensional variances. The board shall, in addition to the above standards, require that evidence be entered into the record of the proceedings showing that: 
(1)  In granting a use variance, the subject land or structure cannot yield any beneficial use if it is required to conform to the provisions of the zoning ordinance. Nonconforming use of neighboring land or structures in the same district and permitted use of land or structures in an adjacent district shall not be considered grounds for granting a use variance; and 
(2)  In granting a dimensional variance, that the hardship that will be suffered by the owner of the subject property if the dimensional variance is not granted shall amount to more than a mere inconvenience, which shall mean that there is no other reasonable alternative to enjoy a legally permitted beneficial use of one's property. The fact that a use may be more profitable or that a structure may be more valuable after the relief is granted shall not be grounds for relief. 
(C)  Special use permit. In granting a special use permit, the board shall require that evidence to [of] the satisfaction of the following standards be entered into the record of the proceedings: 
(1)  That the special use is specifically authorized by this ordinance, and setting forth the exact subsection of this ordinance containing the jurisdictional authorization; 
(2)  That the special use meets all the criteria set forth in the subsection of this ordinance authorizing such special use, except that the board may issue a special use in conjunction with a dimensional variance provided that the dimensional variance may be issued only for the following dimensional requirements, no other dimensional relief can be sought except for that specifically listed herein, and the requested relief shall not exceed a 50 percent deviation from each required dimensional standard, provided however, that the 50 percent limitation shall not apply to nonresidentially zoned properties which: 
i.  Do not abut or share a common boundary with open space and residentially zoned property; or 
ii.  Directly abut the Amtrak Northeast Rail Corridor (NEC), irrespective of the zoning classification of the rail corridor; 
(a)  Section 300, Table 2A and Table 2B Dimensional Regulations, minimum front yard, minimum side yard, minimum rear yard, minimum landscape open space. 
(b)  Sections 505 and 505.1, landscaping and screening. 
(c)  Section 505.6, parking lot buffers. 
(d)  Section 701.7, off-street parking. 
(e)  Section 702.2, number of required loading spaces. 
(f)  Section 806, permitted signs by district. 
(3)  That the granting of the special use permit will not alter the general character of the surrounding area or impair the intent or purpose of this ordinance or the comprehensive plan of the city. 
(D)  Special conditions. In granting a variance or special use permit, or in making any determination upon which it is required to pass after public hearing under this ordinance, the board may apply such special conditions that may, in the opinion of the board, be required to promote the intent and purposes of the comprehensive plan of the city and this ordinance. Failure to abide by any special conditions attached to a grant shall constitute a zoning violation. Such special conditions shall be based on competent credible evidence on the record, be incorporated into the decision, and may include, but are not limited to, provisions for: 
(1)  Minimizing adverse impact of the development upon other land, including the type, intensity, design, and performance of activities; 
(2)  Controlling the sequence of development, including when it must be commenced and completed; 
(3)  Controlling the duration of use or development and the time within which any temporary structure must be removed; 
(4)  Assuring satisfactory installation and maintenance of required public improvements; 
(5)  Designating the exact location and nature of development; and 
(6)  Establishing detailed records by submission of drawings, maps, plats, or specifications. 
(E)  Waiver of architectural and site design requirements in the village district. In order to avoid undue hardship, waivers of architectural and site design requirements included in section 508.1 may be granted by the zoning board of review after the proposal is reviewed by the administrative officer to the planning board and/or the planning board as development plan review (DPR) and a recommendation is forwarded to the zoning board. 
In considering the proposed deviation to the architectural design and development standards as contained in section 508.1 the zoning board shall comply with the standards of relief contained in section 906, and shall also address the following findings. 
1.  Strict compliance will result in undue hardship and practical difficulties in developing or redeveloping the property. 
2.  The proposed structure, improvement or development is consistent with the intent of the village district zoning and the deviation will not result in unnecessary adverse impacts and is in harmony with the general area. 
3.  The proposed use will be consistent with the character of the neighboring land uses within the village district zone. 
4.  The petitioner explored all reasonable alternatives and the deviation requested represents the least deviation required to remove the hardship. 
5.  The requested deviation will not be injurious to neighboring properties or to the general welfare of the surrounding community. 
6.  There is a peculiar characteristics of the property which makes conforming to certain development standards impracticable. 
7.  The deviation will not result in access driveways or sidewalks that do not provide for safe vehicle or pedestrian circulation. 
8.  The deviation will not adversely impact off street parking or loading areas. 
    906.4.  Appeals to the zoning board. 
(A)  Procedure. An appeal to the board from a decision of any other zoning enforcement agency or officer, the planning board or of the HDC, may be taken by an aggrieved party.

In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction on application thereof and upon notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown. 
(C)  Public hearing. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties of interest, as required in R.I.G.L. 45-23-69 and decide the same within 20 days of the hearing.

The zoning board of review shall not reverse a commission decision except on a finding of prejudicial procedural error, clear error or lack of support by the weight of the evidence in the record. The zoning board of review shall put all decisions on appeal in writing. The zoning board of review shall articulate and explain the reasons and basis of each decision on the record, and the zoning board of review shall send a copy of the decision to the applicant and to the historic district commission.

Immediately upon receipt of such proposal, the building official shall refer such proposal to the city council, the director and the planning board for study and recommendation. If the proposal originates with the city council, the city council shall refer such proposal to the building official, the director and the planning board. The planning board shall report to the city council within 45 days after receipt of the proposal, giving its findings and recommendations. The city council shall hold a public hearing within 65 days of receipt of proposal, giving proper notice as prescribed herein. The city council shall render a decision on any such proposal within 45 days after the date of completion of the public hearing. The provisions of this subsection pertaining to deadlines shall not be construed to apply to any extension consented to by the applicant. 
    1007.2.  Review by planning board. Among its findings and recommendations to the amendment or repeal of this ordinance or zoning map, the planning board shall: 
(A)  Include a statement on the general consistency of the proposal with the comprehensive plan of the city, including the goals and policies statement, the implementation program, and all other applicable elements of the comprehensive plan; and 
(B)  Include a demonstration of recognition and consideration of each of the applicable purposes of zoning as presented in section 100 of this ordinance. 
    1007.3.  Notice and hearing requirements. 
(A)  No zoning ordinance shall be adopted, repealed, or amended until after a public hearing has been held upon the question before the city council. The city council shall first give notice of such public hearing by publication of notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least once each week for three consecutive weeks prior to the date of such hearing, which may include the week in which the hearing is to be held, at which hearing opportunity shall be given to all persons interested to be heard upon the matter to the proposed ordinance. Written notice, which may be a copy of said newspaper notice, shall be mailed to the associate director of the division of planning of the Rhode Island department of administration, and, where applicable, to the parties specified in subsections (B), (C), (D) and (E) of this section, at least two weeks prior to the hearing. Such newspaper notice shall be published as a display advertisement, using a type size at least as large as the normal type size used by the newspaper in its news articles, and shall: 
(1)  Specify the place of said hearing and the date and time of its commencement; 
(2)  Indicate that adoption, amendment or repeal of a zoning ordinance is under consideration; 
(3)  Contain a statement of the proposed amendments to the ordinance that may be printed once in its entirety, or summarize or describe the matter under consideration; 
(4)  Advise those interested where and when a copy of the matter under consideration may be obtained or examined and copied; and 
(5)  State that the proposal shown thereon may be altered or amended prior to the close of the public hearing without further advertising, as a result of further study or because of the views expressed at the public hearing. Any such alteration or amendment must be presented for comment in the course of said hearing. 
(B)  Where a proposed general amendment to an existing zoning ordinance includes changes in an existing zoning map, public notice shall be given as required by subsection (1) [(A)] of this section. 
(C)  Where a proposed amendment to an existing ordinance includes a specific change in a zoning district map but does not affect districts generally, public notice shall be given as required in subsection (1) [(A)] of this section, with the additional requirements that: 
(1)  Notice shall include a map showing the existing and proposed boundaries, zoning district boundaries, and existing streets and roads and their names, and city boundaries where appropriate; and 
(2)  Written notice of the date, time and place of the public hearing and the nature and purpose thereof shall be sent to all owners of real property whose property is located within 200 feet of the perimeter of the area proposed for change, whether within the city of within an adjacent city of [or] town in which the property is located; provided however, if the subject property is zoned Residential A-40 or if more than 50 percent of the number of parcels which are residentially zoned land within the 200 foot radius of the subject property are zoned Residential A-40, then notice shall be sent to all property owners of record within 400 feet of the subject property. 
(D)  Notice of a public hearing shall be sent by first class mail to the city or town council of any city or town to which one or more of the following pertain: 
(1)  Which is located within 200 feet of the boundary of the area proposed for change; or 
(2)  Where there is a public or quasipublic water source, or private water source that is used or is suitable for use as a public water source, within 2,000 feet of any real property that is the subject of a proposed zoning change, regardless of municipal boundaries. 
(E)  Notice of a public hearing shall be sent to the governing body of any state or municipal water department or agency, special water district, or private water company that has riparian rights to a surface water resource and/or surface watershed that is used, or is suitable for use, as a public water source and that is within 2,000 feet of any real property which is the subject of a proposed zoning change, provided, however, that the governing body of any state or municipal water company has filed with the building inspector in the city a map survey, which shall be kept as a public record, showing areas of surface water resources and/or watersheds and parcels of land within 2,000 feet thereof. 
(F)  No defect in the form of any notice under this section shall render any ordinance or amendment invalid, unless such defect is found to be intentional or misleading. 
(G)  Costs of any notice required under this section shall be borne by the applicant. 
(H)  In granting a zoning ordinance amendment, the city council may limit the change to one or more of the permitted uses in the zone to which the subject land is rezoned, and impose such limitations, conditions and restrictions, including without limitation: 
(1)  Requiring the petitioner to obtain a permit or approval from any and all federal, state or local governmental agencies having jurisdiction over the land and use which are subject to the zoning change; 
(2)  Relating to the effectiveness or continued effectiveness of the zoning change; and/or 
(3)  Relating to the use of the land as it deems necessary. 
    1007.4.  Conditions and limitations. The building official and the city clerk shall cause the limitations and conditions so imposed to be clearly noted on the zoning map and recorded in the land evidence records, provided, however, in the case of a conditional zone change, the limitations, restrictions, and conditions shall not be noted on the zoning map until the zone change has become effective. If the permitted use for which the land has been rezoned is abandoned or if the land is not used for the requested purpose for a period of two years or more after the zone change becomes effective, the city council may, after a public hearing as hereinbefore set forth, change the land to its original zoning use before such petition was filed. If any limitation, condition, or restriction in an ordinance amendment is held to be invalid by a court in any action, that holding shall not cause the remainder of the ordinance to be invalid. 
    1007.5.  Maintenance of zoning ordinance. The city clerk shall be the custodian of this zoning ordinance and zoning map or maps created thereunder. The building official shall be responsible for maintenance and update of the text and zoning map comprising this ordinance. Changes which impact the zoning map shall be depicted on the map within 90 days of such authorized change(s). The planning department shall be responsible for review of this ordinance annually, and whenever changes are made to the comprehensive plan of the city, to identify any changes necessary and forward these changes to the city council. 
    1007.6.  Publication and availability of zoning ordinance. Printed copies of this ordinance and map(s) shall be available to the general public through the city clerk and the building official, and shall be revised to include all amendments. A reasonable charge may be made for copies to reflect printing and distribution costs. 
    1007.7.  Sending of copies of zoning ordinance. Upon publication of this ordinance and map(s), and any amendments thereto, the city clerk shall send a copy, without charge, to the associate director of the division of planning of the department of administration of the State of Rhode Island, and to the state law library. 
(Ord. No. O-00-36, § I, 9-26-00) 
1008. - Appeal of enactment of or amendment to zoning ordinance. 
    An appeal of the enactment of or an amendment to this ordinance may be taken to the superior court for Kent County by filing a complaint within 30 days after such enactment or amendment has become effective. The complaint shall set forth with specificity the area or areas in which the enactment or amendment does not conform with the comprehensive plan and/or the manner in which it constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation. Such appeal may be taken by an aggrieved party or by any legal resident or landowner of the city, or by any association of residents or landowners of the city. This appeal shall not stay the enforcement of the zoning ordinance, as enacted or amended, but the court may, in its discretion, grant a stay on appropriate terms, which may include the filing of a bond, and make such other orders as it deems necessary for an equitable disposition of the appeal. 
1009. - Vested rights. 
(A)  Any application for development under this ordinance, including an application for a building permit, special use permit, variance, planned development, or cluster development, shall be deemed substantially complete when all required documents, including plans, together with required fees, are received by the official designated herein to receive such applications. Required documents shall include only those documents specified either by this ordinance or by rules adopted and published by the permitting authority prior to the time the application is filed. 
(B)  Any application for development under this ordinance that is substantially complete prior to the enactment or amendment of this ordinance shall be reviewed according to the regulations applicable in the zoning ordinance in force at the time the application was submitted. If such application is approved, the applicant must begin construction, or exercise the right granted in the application if no construction is involved, not more than one year after the date of such approval. All construction must be completed not more than two years after the date of such approval, unless specifically set forth to the contrary in the original approval. 
(C)  Any building permit issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance or any amendment thereto may be activated within one year from the date of issuance. Any such permit for a use which by virtue of the adoption of this ordinance or any amendment thereto would become nonconforming may not be renewed if not activated within one year from the date of issuance. 
1010. - Effective date. 
    This ordinance is effective as of December 31, 1994. 
1011. - Severability. 
    If any provision of this ordinance or of any rule, regulation or determination made thereunder, or the application thereof to any person, agency or circumstances, is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance or the rule, regulation, or determination and the application of such provisions to other persons, agencies, or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. The invalidity of any section or sections of this ordinance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the ordinance.
