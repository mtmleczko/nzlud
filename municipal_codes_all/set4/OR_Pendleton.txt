(Section 8, as amended by Ordinance No. 2719, passed June 18, 1974.)
SECTION 9. Clearance for Vital Structures. The excavation work shall not interfere with access to vital structures.
SECTION 10. Relocation and Protection of City-Owned Utilities. The permittee shall not interfere with any
existing City-owned utility without the written consent of the City Manager. If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing Cityowned
utility, this shall be done by the City. No utility owned by the City shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost
of such work be borne by the permittee.
The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all substructures, which may be in any way affected by the
excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across said work. In case any
substructures should be damaged, and for this purpose, pipe coating or other encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a
substructure, they shall be repaired by the owner and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee, and his or its bond
shall be liable therefor. The permittee and his surety shall be liable for any damage done to any public property by reason of breaking
of any water pipes, sewers, or other City-owned utility, and its bond shall be liable therefor.
When it is found desirable by the City Manager, other utilities will be notified by the permittee of his intention to make an
excavation. This will be done in order that these utilities may make arrangements to perform any work planned for that same area at
the time the excavation is made.
SECTION 11. Abandonment of Structures. Whenever the use of a substructure is abandoned, except the
abandonment of a service line designed to serve a single property owner, the person owning, using, controlling, or having interest
therein, shall within thirty (30) days after such abandonment file with the City Manager a statement in writing giving in detail the
location of the substructure so abandoned. If such abandoned substructure is in the way, or subsequently becomes in the way, of an
installation of the City or any other public body, the owner shall remove such abandoned substructure or pay the cost of its removal
during the course of excavation for construction of the facility by the City or any other public body.
SECTION 12. Protection of Adjoining Property. The permittee shall at all times, at his or its own expense, preserve
and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose.
Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protecting
measures, the permittee shall obtain a license from the owner of such private property for such purpose and if he cannot obtain a
license from such owner, the City Manager may authorize him to enter the private premises at reasonable hours solely for the purpose
of making the property safe.
The permittee shall, at his own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged
during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage resulting from his failure properly to protect and
carry out said work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, the sod shall be carefully cut and
rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled as required in this Ordinance. All construction and maintenance work shall be
done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which
8/10/2020 2287.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11431 4/9
existed before such work began. Access to driveways shall be kept open insofar as possible during the performance of work by the
permittee.
When it is found desirable by the City Manager, the permittee shall be instructed to send notice by mail of work to be performed to
abutting property owners. This shall be done in order to minimize inconvenience to such property owners in their normal usage of the
public streets.

SECTION 13. Care of Excavated Material. All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or
in any street shall be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians, or users of the
streets and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to permit the piling of excavated
material beside the trench, the permittee shall haul the excavated material to a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the
time of backfilling. It shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements
for all required storage and disposal sites.
Whenever necessary in order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate the dirt or dust nuisance, tow boards or bins shall be
required by the City Manager to prevent the spreading of dirt into traffic lanes.
All trench and tunnel excavations and construction shall conform with safety requirements for shoring, bracing and ladders in
trenches conforming to standard City specifications on file with the Public Works Director.
(Section 13, as amended by Ordinance No. 2719, passed June 18, 1974.)
SECTION 14. Clean Up. As the excavation work progresses, all streets shall be kept thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish,
excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work. All clean up operations at the location of such excavation shall be
accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be complete. From time to time, as may be ordered by the City Manager, and in
any event immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall, at his or its own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and
unused materials of any kind resulting from said work, and upon failure to do so within twenty-four (24) hours after having been
notified to do so by the City Manager, said work may be done by the City and the cost thereof charged to the permittee.
SECTION 15. Protection of Watercourses. The permittee shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the full
depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the face of such curb at the gutterline. Whenever a gutter crosses an
intersection street, an adequate waterway shall be provided and all times maintained.
The permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt, slickings, or other run-off pumped from
excavations or resulting from sluicing or other operations and shall be responsible for damage resulting from his failure to so provide.
SECTION 16. Breaking Through Pavement.
A. Heavy duty pavement breakers shall be provided by the City Manager when the use may endanger existing substructures or
other property.
B. The City Manager shall require cutting of pavement surfaces ahead of excavations in such a manner as to confine pavement
damage to the limits of the trench. Pavement wearing surface cuts shall be made with a sharp edged tool which will result in a smooth
edge along the sides of the excavation.
C. Sections of sidewalks shall be removed to the nearest score line or saw cut edge.
D. Unstable pavement shall be removed over cave-outs and over-breakers and the subgrade shall be treated as the main trench.
E. Pavement edges shall be trimmed to a vertical face and neatly aligned with the center line of the trench.
F. Cutouts outside of the trench lines must be normal or parallel to the trench line.
G. Boring or other methods to prevent cutting of new pavement may be required by the City Manager.
H. The permittee shall not be required to repair damage existing prior to excavation unless his cut results in small floating
sections that may be unstable, in which case the permittee shall remove and refill the area.
SECTION 17. Depth of Structures. No person shall, without written permission of the City manager, install any
substructure, except manholes, vaults, valve casings, culverts, and catch basins at a distance less than:
A. Streets -- 30 inches below the established street or alley grade.
B. Parkways -- (1) The minimum depth of any substructure shall be 24 inches below established street or alley grade when said
substructure parallels the parkway. (2) The minimum depth of any substructure shall be 24 inches below the top of the established
8/10/2020 2287.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11431 5/9
sidewalk or curb when such substructure is at right angles to the parkway.
C. Other public places -- The minimum depth of any substructure in any other public place shall be 24 inches below the surface;
provided, however, that the City Manager may permit a lesser depth in special cases.
Nothing in this section shall impose a duty upon the permittee to maintain said specifications as required herein upon subsequent
changes of grade in the surface unless the grade in said substructure interferes with the maintenance of, or travel on, a public street.
SECTION 18. Backfilling. Selected backfill material shall be placed in trenches containing pipe, simultaneously on both
sides of the pipe for the full width of the trench in layers about four inches in depth, and tamped thoroughly with a pneumatic tamper.
The entire depth of the trench shall be thoroughly compacted with selected material and by means of hand or mechanically operated
tampers, in layers of approximately four inches, and shall be brought to the required surface grade without damage to pipe.
(1)
2-3
In lieu of the backfilling procedure specified above, river run gravel, or crushed rock or gravel may be used for backfilling that
portion of the trench more than six inches above the top of the pipe, provided the maximum size of material shall not exceed four
inches in diameter and shall be of uniform graduation with 20 percent or more passing a one-fourth inch square screen.
When this procedure is followed, tamping the rock or gravel is not necessary. The upper three inches of backfill shall be made
with 3/4"-0" mineral aggregate and compacted flush with the existing pavement.
The backfilled trench shall be maintained by the permittee in such a manner that will provide a smooth crossing until such time as
the street is repaved.
The City Manager may require soil tests to be furnished by a recognized soil testing laboratory or registered professional engineer
specializing in soil mechanics when, in his opinion, backfill for any excavation is not being adequately compacted. In order for the
resurfacing to be permitted, such tests shall show that the backfill material meets the minimum requirements as prescribed by this
Ordinance. All expense of such tests shall be borne by the permittee.
SECTION 19. Restoration of Surface. Between April 1st and September 31st, excavation, pavement resurfacing, and
re-excavations shall be made at the expense of the permittee by the City, or by a bonded contractor approved by the City, where the
type of consolidation is performed to City Standards. Existing pavement surface must be cut in a manner to provide a clean vertical
surface to full depth of the existing pavement surface prior to pavement resurfacing. All old asphalt material must be removed and the
vertical surface must be thoroughly tacked prior to placement of new pavement resurfacing. Depending on availability of pavement
resurfacing material between October 1st and March 31st, permanent pavement resurfacing may be allowed only with approval by the
City. Between October 1st and March 31st, temporary resurfacing shall be provided by the permittee, or by the City at the expense of
the permittee. If temporary resurfacing is provided, the top surface of the backfill shall be covered with a minimum of two inch of
bituminous material. Such temporary paving material shall be cold mix, except that the permittee may use or the City may allow hot
mix based on availability. All temporary paving material shall conform closely enough to the level of the adjoining paving surface and
shall be compacted so that it is hard enough and smooth enough to be safe for pedestrian travel over it for vehicular traffic to pass
safely over it at a legal rate of speed, and for maintaining drainage of storm water. The permittee shall maintain temporary paving after
all backfilling is completed, and shall keep some safe for pedestrian and vehicular traffic to pass safety over it at a legal rate of speed.
The permittee shall maintain temporary paving after all backfilling is completed, and shall keep some safe for pedestrian and vehicular
traffic until the excavation has been resurfaced with permanent paving, except that if it is impractical to maintain the surface of the
temporary paving in a safe condition for pedestrian travel or vehicular traffic, then the permittee, shall maintain barriers and light when
required herein. Immediately prior to replacing temporary resurfacing with pavement resurfacing, a new clean vertical surface must be
cut in existing pavement surface to full depth of existing pavement surface. All old asphalt material must be removed and the vertical
surface must be thoroughly tacked prior to placement of new pavement resurfacing. (Section 19, as amended by Ordinance No. 3705,
passed May 18, 2004)
SECTION 20. City’s Right to Restore Surface. Upon completion of the backfilling, and when the required
temporary resurfacing of an excavation within a public place for the installation or removal of substructures is to be replaced by
permanent surface, the City Manager, may require the permittee to resurface that portion of the street surface damaged by the
permittee’s excavation, in which event resurfacing shall be done in a manner and under specifications prescribed by this Ordinance,
subject to inspection, and shall be completed after such authorization to complete final resurfacing. The City Manager may elect to do
such resurfacing with City forces, in which event, the cost of such resurfacing shall be borne by the permittee.
8/10/2020 2287.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11431 6/9
SECTION 21. Acceptance of Restoration. Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the City Manager shall
not prevent the City from asserting a claim against the permittee and his or its surety under the surety bond required hereunder for
incomplete or defective work if discovered within 12 months from the completion of the excavation work. The presence of City
officials during the performance of excavation work shall not relieve the permittee of his responsibilities hereunder.
SECTION 22. Trenches in Pipe Laying. The maximum length of open trench permissible at any time shall be no more
than 200 feet, and no greater length shall be open for pavement removal, excavation, construction, backfilling, patching, and all other
operations without the written permission of the City Manager.
SECTION 23. Prompt Completion of Work. After an excavation is commenced, the permittee shall prosecute with
diligence and speed all excavation work covered by the excavation permit and shall promptly complete such work and restore the street
to its original condition, or as near as may be, so as not to obstruct the public place or travel thereon more than is reasonably necessary.
(1)
2-3
SECTION 24. Urgent Work. If in his judgment, traffic conditions, the safety or convenience of the traveling public, or
the public interest require that the excavation work be performed as emergency work, the City Manager shall order, at the time the
permit is granted, that a crew of men and adequate facilities be employed by the permittee 24 hours a day to the end that such
excavation work may be completed as soon as possible.
SECTION 25. Emergency Action. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed to prevent the making of such
excavations as may be necessary for the preservation of life or property or for the location of trouble in a conduit or pipe, or for making
repairs, provided that the person making such excavation shall apply to the City Manager for such a permit on the first working day
after such work is commenced.
SECTION 26. Noise, Dust and Debris. Each permittee shall conduct excavation work in such a manner as to avoid
unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and occupants of neighboring property. The permittee shall take
appropriate measures to reduce to the fullest extent practicable in the performance of the excavation work, noise, dust, and unsightly
debris, and between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. shall not use, except with the express written permission of the City Manager,
or in case of an emergency as herein otherwise provided, any tool, appliance, or equipment producing noise of sufficient volume to
disturb the sleep or repose of occupants of the neighboring property. (Section 26 as amended by Ordinance No. 3705, passed May 18,
2004.)
SECTION 27. Preservation of Monuments. Any monument set for the purpose of locating or preserving the lines of
any street or property subdivision, or a precise survey reference point, or a permanent survey bench mark within the City, and any
horse rings, angle irons, and street stamps should not be removed, and shall be reinstalled in the improved curb or sidewalks as is
feasible. Permission to remove or disturb such monuments reference points, or bench marks shall only be granted upon condition that
the person applying for such permission shall pay all expenses incident to the proper replacement of this monument by the City. Angle
irons frequently are found on curbs, especially at corners and have protected curbs from carriage wheels. Stamps are found in concrete
with street names, construction company names, and years of construction. Where street improvements disturb these artifacts, they are
to be installed with the new facility, as close as possible, to where they were originally found. In circumstances where this is not
possible, the artifacts shall be held by the City and reused in places where these artifacts have been lost.
(Section 27, as amended by Ordinance No. 3753, passed June 13, 2007.)
SECTION 28. Inspections. The City Manager shall have such inspections made as are reasonably necessary in the
enforcement of this Ordinance. The permittee shall notify the City, prior to backfilling an excavation so that proper inspection may be
made.
SECTION 29. Maintenance of Drawings. Every person owning, using, controlling or having an interest in
substructures under the surface of any public place used for the purpose of supplying or conveying gas, electricity, communication
impulse, water, steam, ammonia or oil in the City, shall file with the City Manager within 120 days after adoption of this Ordinance a
map or set of maps each drawn to a scale of not less than one inch to 100 feet showing in detail the location, size, description and date

may at its option provide corrected atlas sheets at more frequent intervals. (Section 29 as amended by Ordinance No. 3705, passed
May 18, 2004.)
SECTION 30. Liability of City. This Ordinance shall not be construed as imposing upon the City or any official or
employee any liability responsibility for damages to any person injured by the performance of any excavation work for which an
excavation permit is issued hereunder, nor shall the City or any official or employee thereof be deemed to have assumed any such
liability or responsibility by reason of inspections authorized hereunder, the issuance of any permit, or by the approval of any

CITY OF PENDLETON ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:
ARTICLE 1 -- TITLE AND PURPOSE
SECTION 1.01. TITLE. This Ordinance is known as the “Sign Code,” may be cited as such, and referred to

(Section 1.01, as amended by Ordinance No. 3896, passed August 2, 2016.)
SECTION 1.02. PURPOSE. The Council of the City of Pendleton, Oregon, hereby finds that:
A. Signs have an obvious impact on the character and quality of the environment.

and the City as a whole.
C. Signs which are properly designed and appropriate to their surroundings have a legitimate place in our
environment.
D. Signs guide the traveler and residents on their way, remind them of rules and safety, and identify business
and give information as to the products and services available.
E. It is necessary to regulate the erection, maintenance, electric illumination, type, size, number and location
of signs in order to:
(1) Protect the health, safety, property and welfare of the public;
(2) Maintain the neat, clean, orderly and attractive appearance of the City;
(3) Provide for the safe erection and maintenance of signs;
(4) Eliminate signs that demand, rather than invite public attention;
(5) Provide equity and equality in displaying signs in consonance with their zoning and District location;
(6) Preserve and enhance the unique scenic beauty and the business, recreational, educational, tourist and
retirement potential of the City and the surrounding area.
(Section 1.02, as amended by Ordinance No. 3025, passed July 3, 1979; and Ordinance No. 3896, passed
August 2, 2016.)
ARTICLE 2 -- GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 2.01. SIGNS PERMITTED PER ELIGIBLE PROPERTY. Each eligible property must be
allowed a single Ground, Projecting, Freestanding, Wall or Sloping Roof sign based on its applicable Sign
District. Each eligible property may allocate its remaining sign allowance within each applicable category as
it sees fit, provided the maximum sign area per category is not exceeded.
8/10/2020 2775
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=12004 2/26
Each business must be allowed signage as provided in Section 4.03, fronting a parking area or improved
public right-of-way, or on a side whose one-way traffic flow would not allow visual contact with the parking
area or improved public right-of-way.
Each business may be allowed those applicable Exempt Signs set forth in this Ordinance.
Any business which is located on two or more properties which are not contiguous to each other, or separated
by a public right-of-way (roadway and/or railroad) must be considered as a separate business and be
permitted the appropriate signage applicable.
(Section 2.01, as amended by Ordinance No. 2849, passed October 26, 1976; and Ordinance No. 3025,
passed July 3, 1979 and Ordinance No. 3896, passed August 2, 2016.)
SECTION 2.02. DETERMINATION OF ALLOWABLE SIGNS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS. In
classifying any sign and determining applicable regulations, the use of the following procedure is suggested:
STEP 1. Determine whether sign is on-premise or conditional. (See Tables I and II herein.)
STEP 2. Determine the location of the building (where the sign is to be located) on Map 1 and Map 2 and
establish the Zone [Map 1] and the District [Map 2 and Section 4.01 of this Ordinance] designation
of the sign’s location.
STEP 3. Determine the category of sign desired (Wall, Projecting, Ground, Freestanding, or Sloping roof)
from Table I herein.
STEP 4. Consult the appropriate Table I or Table II herein, as determined in Step 1, and find the column
specifying that category of sign determined in Step 2.
STEP 5. Determine more specifically the square footage of signage based upon category of sign (For
example: a projecting sign containing a static sign, a separate reader board section with animated
logo).
STEP 6. Establish the permissibility (outright, conditional, exempt, or prohibited) of the sign desired by
reading across to the left horizontally from the type of sign determined in Step 4.
STEP 7. Locate category desired within the Article specified by Step 5 and establish the limitations imposed
on the sign and whether or not a permit or Bond from the City is required:
(a) If sign type desired is permitted outright, proceed to Step 8.
(b) If sign type desired is permitted either conditionally, exempt or prohibited, all limitations as to
size, height, etc. are specified. Obtain Building Department permits as necessary, prior to
erection of the sign.
STEP 8. Consult Table III herein and find the appropriate horizontal column which contains the Zone and
District determined in Step 2.
STEP 9. Take the sign category determined in Step 3 and using only the horizontal column established in
Step 8 enter the sign requirement portion of the table under type and match the desired sign with
that noted.
STEP 10. Determine the Sign Face Area allowable by reading horizontally to the right. Freestanding and
ground signs have a specified maximum area allowed. NOTE: The area allowed can be increased
by fifty (50%) percent by providing live landscaping at the base (see Table III herein, annotation 2
for specifics). Projecting, wall and facelift have a maximum area which must be calculated in
accordance with the appropriate annotation described below Table III herein. (See examples on
“Exhibit A” attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof, to determine the allowable
sign face area for projecting, wall and facelift.)
STEP 11. Contact the Building Department to obtain necessary permits, prior to erection of the sign.
(Section 2.02, as amended by Ordinance No. 3025, passed July 3, 1979 and Ordinance No. 3896, passed

EXHIBIT A - SAMPLE SIGN AREA CALCULATIONS
EXAMPLE A
STEP 1. Determine the location of the sign. (NOTE: To achieve the maximum projection the sign
should be located in the middle of the business frontage.)
STEP 2. Calculate the allowable projection by measuring in feet the distance from the sign location to
the nearest corner of the business (which may be the building) and multiplying it by 3". In the
diagram above it would be 20 X 3 = 60" or 5 feet. (NOTE: This projection is equal to the
maximum allowable projection over the public right of way. If the building was set back from
the property line and the building/ business frontage is greater than 40 feet, a larger projection
would be permissible.)
8/10/2020 2775
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=12004 22/26
STEP 3. Determine the upper height of the sign. In this example assume the maximum height is
available as shown (but beware, it could be less), thus a 10-foot vertical dimension (the
difference between the upper and lower limits) is available for a sign.
STEP 4. Calculate the allowable sign face area by multiplying the projection dimension (Step 2) and
the vertical dimension (Step 3). In this example it would be 10 X 5 = 50 square feet.
EXAMPLE B -- HOW TO CALCULATE THE AREA OF A WALL SIGN
Use Diagram shown with Example A.
STEP 1. Calculate the allowable wall sign face area using A. below:
A. Multiply the Building/Business Frontage (in feet) by 2. In this example, the sign face area
would be 40 X 2 = 80 square feet.
EXAMPLE C -- HOW TO CALCULATE THE AREA OF SIGNAGE FOR A FACELIFT
Use Diagram shown with Example A.
STEP 1. Calculate the allowable wall sign face area (See Example B, Step 1 (A) for method of
calculation). Since we are using the diagram as shown in Example A, the wall sign face area
is 80 square feet.
STEP 2. Calculate the allowable facelift area by doubling the sign face area determined in Step 1.
Thus, in this example it would be 80 X 2 = 160 square feet for facelift area.
EXAMPLE D -- HOW TO CALCULATE THE AREA OF A SECONDARY SIGN
STEP 1. If a secondary sign can be erected (Section 2.01) determine which type of sign (freestanding,
ground, projecting, wall and facelift) is desired to be used.
STEP 2. Calculate the allowable sign face area (use method of calculating Example A for projecting,
Example B for wall, Example C for facelift, Section 4.04 Table III for freestanding or ground)
and divide it in half, thus giving the sign face area for that type of secondary sign. Using
Example A and its diagram it would be 50 2 = 25 square feet of sign face area for a projecting
secondary sign.

plot purchaser of said interment or interments until such property is fully paid for in cash, including principal
and interest; and, in case the purchaser shall fail to meet all payments within thirty days after demand is made
by the City of Pendleton, then the cemetery management may hold the same as of its former state. The City of
Pendleton, thereupon, shall be released from all obligations thereunder, and may retain all payments, which
have been made toward the purchase of such property as liquidated damages. The cemetery management shall
have the right at any time thereafter, without notice, at its discretion, to remove to single graves, to be chosen by
the cemetery management, each of the remains then interred in said property.
F. Notice. The cemetery management shall have the right to require 3 working days notice prior to any
interments and five working days notice prior to any disinterment or removal. Any interment, disinterment or
removal may be postponed if, at the discretion of the Parks Director, such postponement is warranted.
G. Authority to Inter. The signing of an application for service will in some cases be sufficient authority
to inter and this requirement may be waived for the interment of a deceased plot owner or spouse; however, the
cemetery management may require legal proof of ownership, the right to sign for the owner, or other good and
sufficient proof of authority. No change or alteration will be permitted where the plot owner has previously
filed written instructions with the cemetery, except by the due process of law.
H. Grave liner. Every casket must be enclosed in a crush resistant outer case or box constructed of
concrete, metal, or of a substance determined by the Parks Director to be of sufficient strength. All grave liners
will be purchased and placed by Olney Cemetery, or through a contractor approved by the Cemetery. Fees will
be charged based on current fee schedule.

or bronze container designed for permanent direct burial. Temporary or unsecure containers must be placed in a
liner. Cremains left in care of the cemetery prior to interment will be stored at the risk of the person depositing
the same and no liability or responsibility for the safekeeping will be accepted by the cemetery. All interments
of cremains must be made by employees of the cemetery and any infraction, such as scattering ashes in an area
not designated for scattered remains, may result in immediate removal and disposition made in an appropriate
manner by the management. The cemetery will not be responsible for the preservation of any urn.
J. Location of Interment Space. When instructions from the plot owner regarding the location of an
interment space in a plot cannot be obtained or are indefinite or when for any reason the interment space cannot
be opened where specified, the cemetery management may, at its discretion, open a space in such location as it
8/10/2020 2777.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11402 3/13
deems best and proper, so as not to delay the funeral. The City, or its employees, shall not be liable for damages
for any error so made.
K. Orders Given by Telephone. The City of Pendleton, its staff agents and employees, will not be
responsible for any order given by telephone, or for any mistake occurring from the want of precise instructions
as to the particular space, size and location in plot where interment is desired. Telephone orders from a funeral
director or any other person representing the plot owner will be the sole responsibility of the person telephoning
the order.
L. Errors May be Corrected. The City of Pendleton, its staff agents and employees, reserves, and shall
have the right to correct any errors that may be made in making interments, disinterments or removals or in the
description, transfer or conveyance of any interment right or property either by canceling such conveyance and
substituting and conveying in lieu thereof other interment property of equal value and similar location as far as
possible, or as may be selected by the cemetery management, or in the discretion of the Parks Director, by
refunding the amount of money paid on account of such purchase. In the event the error shall involve the
interment of the remains of any person in such property, the cemetery management shall have the right to
remove, and reinter the remains on such other property of equal value and similar location as may be substituted
and conveyed in lieu thereof. Errors in interment, arising from an improper person or persons signing an
application for service, shall be corrected at the discretion of the Parks Director at the expense of the person or
persons signing the application, and, where a deed, license, certificate or other instrument of conveyance, not
issued by the City of Pendleton or its duly authorized manager, has not been registered on the books of the
cemetery, all the responsibility of determining ownership or correcting errors either prior to or after interment
will lie with the person or persons claiming ownership or protesting an error.
M. Delays in Interments. The City of Pendleton will in no way be liable for the delay in the interment of a
body where a protest, written or verbal, to the interment has been made, or where the rules and regulations have
not been complied with, or where previously filed written instructions of the plot owner conflict; and, further,
the cemetery management shall have the right to make other temporary disposal or storage of the body, under
such circumstances, until full rights have been determined. The cemetery management may require any protest
to be in writing and filed in the office of the City Manager at City Hall.
(1)
1-29
N. Not Responsible for Identity. The cemetery management shall not be held responsible for establishing
the correct identity of any body sought to be interred or for the identity of any body interred prior to control of
the cemetery by the City of Pendleton. The signing of an application giving the statistics relative to an
interment to be made shall constitute all authority necessary to make the interment and enter in the records of
the cemetery all information contained therein the spelling of any names of persons or places as they appear.
The cemetery management shall have the right to make corrections where, in its discretion the interest of the
cemetery will be served.
O. Interment. Interment is subject to the following requirements and prohibitions:
(1) Interment is limited exclusively to human remains. The Tree Haven Pet Cemetery section of the
cemetery is limited to pets of a size which is limited at the discretion of the Parks Director.
(2) The number of remains of humans interred in a single grave, is limited to:

b. Subject to the proscribed fee, cremated remains may be interred in a single full-body grave as
follows:

ii. Not more than four separate cremains.
(3) The number of remains in a crypt, niche, or cremains grave will be limited to one, unless clearly

A. The taxes imposed by this Ordinance shall be paid by the occupant to the lodging tax

deadline fixed by the Tax Administrator and made under penalties for false swearing.
C. Any lodging tax collector accruing less than $100.00 tax annually may in lieu of

this section shall exempt lodging tax collectors from filing at least one report annually. Annual reports
under this section are due on the last day of the calendar year and delinquent thirty (30) days thereafter.

The Tax Administrator shall require returns to show the total rentals upon which tax was collected or

the Tax Administrator at the time fixed for filing returns.
E. The person required to file the return shall deliver the return, together with the

time for making any return or payment of tax. No further extension shall be granted, except by the
Transient Room Tax Review Committee. Any lodging tax collector to whom an extension is granted

a fraction of a month. If a return is not filed, and the tax and interest due is not paid by the end of the
extension granted, then the interest shall become a part of the tax for computation of penalties described
elsewhere in this Ordinance.
G. The Tax Administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure payment or facilitate
collection by the City of the amount of taxes in any individual case, may require returns and payment of
the amount of taxes for other than quarterly periods.

for remittance of tax due and who fails to remit any tax imposed by this Ordinance prior to delinquency

B. Continued Delinquency. Any lodging tax collector who has not been granted an extension of
time for remittance of tax due, and who failed to pay any delinquent remittance on or before a period of
thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second
delinquency penalty of fifteen (15%) percent of the amount of the tax due plus the amount of the tax and
the ten (10%) percent penalty first imposed.

SECTION 10. DEFICIENCY DETERMINATIONS; FRAUD, EVASION,
DELAY.
A. Deficiency Determination. If the Tax Administrator determines that the returns are incorrect, he
may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of the facts contained in the
return or returns or upon the basis of any information within his possession or that may come into his
possession. One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one, or more
than one period, and the amount so determined shall be due and payable immediately upon service of
notice as herein provided after which the amount determined is delinquent. Penalties on deficiencies
shall be applied as set forth in Section 9.
1. In making a determination the Tax Administrator may offset overpayments, if any, which
may have been previously made for a period or periods, against any underpayment for a subsequent
period or periods, or against penalties, and interest, on the underpayments. The interest on
underpayments shall be computed in the manner set forth in Section 9.
2. The Tax Administrator shall give to the lodging tax collector a written notice of his
determination. The notice may be served personally or by mail; if by mail, the notice shall be
addressed to the lodging tax collector at his address as it appears in the records of the Tax
Administrator. In case of service by mail or any notice required by this Ordinance the service is
complete at the time of deposit in the United States Post Office.

regulations, every deficiency determination shall be made and notice thereof mailed within three (3)

is proposed to be determined or within three (3) years after the return is filed, whichever period
expires the later.
4. Any determination shall become due and payable immediately upon receipt of notice and
shall become final within ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator has given notice thereof,
provided, however, the lodging tax collector may petition redemption and refund if the petition is
filed before the determination becomes final as herein provided.
B. Fraud, Refusal to Collect, Evasion. If any lodging tax collector shall fail or refuse to collect said
tax or to make, within the time provided in this Ordinance, any report and remittance of said tax or any
portion thereof required by this Ordinance, or makes a fraudulent return or otherwise willfully attempts to
evade this Ordinance, the Tax Administrator has determined the tax due that is imposed by this Ordinance
from any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to report and remit said tax, he shall
proceed to determine and assess against such lodging tax collector the tax, interest and penalties provided
for by this Ordinance. In case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice in
the manner aforesaid of the amount so assessed. Such determination and notice shall be made and mailed
within three (3) years after discovery by the Tax Administrator of any fraud, intent to evade or failure or
refusal to collect said tax, or failure to file return. Any determination shall become due and payable
immediately upon receipt of notice and shall become final within ten (10) days after the Tax
Administrator has given notice thereof, provided, however, the lodging tax collector may petition
redemption and refund if the petition is filed before the determination becomes final as herein provided.
C. Lodging Tax Collector Delay. If the Tax Administrator believes that the collection of any tax or
any amount of tax required to be collected and paid to the City will be jeopardized by delay, or if any
determination will be jeopardized by delay, he shall thereupon make a determination of the tax or amount
of tax required to be collected, noting the fact upon the determination. The amount so determined as

pay same determination to the Tax Administrator after service of notice thereof. Provided, however, the
lodging tax collector may petition, after payment has been made for redemption and refund of such
determination, if the petition is ruled within ten (10) days from the date of service of notice by the Tax
Administrator.

Section 10, the determination becomes final at the expiration of the allowable time.
B. If a petition for redetermination and refund is filed within the allowable period, the Tax
Administrator shall reconsider the determination, and, if the person has so requested in his petition, shall
grant the person an oral hearing and shall give him ten (10) days notice of the time and place of the

security shall be fixed by the Tax Administrator but shall not be greater than twice the lodging tax

regulations, any amendments and additions shall be mailed to both the local and head office of each utility using the streets of
Pendleton at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date thereof. The regulations shall be filed with the City Recorder and shall be
available for public inspection.
SECTION 4. Authority of City to Order Changes. The Council of the City of Pendleton retains the power
and authority, by resolution or motion, to order the relocation within any area of the City of any existing or future poles, wires, or
fixtures to or from streets, alleys, or public easements, or from poles to underground conduits, where the Council finds and determines,
after consultation with the Umatilla County Utility Coordinating Council, that such relocation is necessary or desirable by reason of
8/10/2020 2813.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11400 2/3
traffic congestion, or the partial obstruction or impairment of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or by reason of the existence of hazards or
dangerous conditions created by the location of such poles, wires, or fixtures, except when controlled by State law or regulation.
In the event that the utility is requested to relocate its facilities for purely aesthetic purposes or for the convenience of some
person, group of persons or business, then the requesting party shall bear the expense of the removal.
When the Council determines, after consultation with the Umatilla County Utility Coordinating Council, that joint use of
poles by two or more utilities is feasible and desirable in a particular area or street and the City makes written request to utilities for
such joint use, then, if the request is not complied with, the Council may order any or all such utilities to provide such joint use under
terms and conditions deemed by the Council to be fair, equitable and reasonable to all parties concerned or the Council may order such
utilities to place such wires in underground conduits.
The Council shall have the power and authority, by resolution or motion, to order the raising or lowering of pipelines or
conduits where the Council finds and determines that any pipeline or conduit conflicts with the proposed location of any City owned
pipeline designed to carry on substance or material by gravity flow, or by reason of the establishment of an original grade or change in
the grade of any street; provided, however, that where a change is made in a legally established grade, the Council may prescribe
reasonable terms for such raising or lowering of pipelines or conduits.
Whenever there is a bona fide dispute between the City and one or more utilities or between two utilities concerning use of a
street or joint use of facilities and the affected parties are unable to reach an agreement, the question may be submitted to arbitration
under the pertinent laws of the State of Oregon. (Section 4, as amended by Ordinance No. 3002, passed April 3, 1979.)
SECTION 5. Location Maps. Within ten (10) days after receiving written request from the Public Works Director, a
utility shall deliver to the City location maps, or available information, showing the location of all pipelines and underground conduits
in specified streets, which are the subject of proposed street or sewer improvements. In any event such maps shall be delivered to the
City within thirty (30) days upon request.
SECTION 6. Movement of Utilities. Whenever a utility is required to move its facilities as provided for in Section
4 of this Ordinance the utility shall be given at least sixty (60) days from the date of notice within which to accomplish such change.
When the City has contracted for the construction of a public improvement upon any street, it shall give the written notice provided
herein at or about the time of the letting of such contract, but in no event less than sixty (60) days prior to the time required for moving
any poles, fixtures, wires, pipelines, or conduits as herein provided. Failure to move the facilities as directed within the time allotted
shall constitute a material breach of the terms of this franchise.
SECTION 7. Movement of Buildings and Structures. No person, firm, or corporation shall move, or cause to
be moved, over any City street, a building or structure unless such person, firm, or corporation shall have first given at least 96 hours
written notice thereof, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays, to the Public Works Department and Police Department of the City
and to all utilities having wires which must be raised or lowered to permit the passage or movement of the building or structure along
or across the street. The aforesaid written notice shall designate therein the proposed route over which such building or structure is to
travel, the proposed time that such movement is to take place, the height of the building, and the estimated weight of the building or
structure. Before the time specified for the movement of such building, the Public Works Director may require that a different route be
taken or that specific methods be used in the movement of such building if, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, damage might
be caused to any street. The Public Works Director may also designate a different time of day for such movement and give notice
thereof to the utilities in the event that an interruption of utility service at the proposed time will unduly inconvenience the public.
Where utility wires must be raised or lowered there shall be paid in advance to the utilities involved the actual cost of raising or
lowering such wires. If the notices herein described are given and the cost paid to the utilities, it shall be the duty of such utilities to
raise or lower all wires necessary at the required time.
SECTION 8. Obstructions. A utility shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging all streets, alleys,
easements, sidewalks and public places of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with utility
facilities. Except in an emergency, notice and demand for removal within forty eight (48) hours shall be made upon the owner of such
trees, and the utility shall hold the City harmless from any damage caused by trimming of trees.
SECTION 9. Responsibility of Utility. A utility shall be responsible and liable for any damages caused by its
failure or neglect to comply with any of the provisions of this Ordinance, or the rules, regulations and standards adopted under the
terms of this Ordinance, for the protection of persons or property; and neither the City nor any of its officers or employees shall be
liable for a dangerous or negligently created condition caused by the utility or by the failure of the utility to comply with this Ordinance
or the rules, regulations and standards provided for herein. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed to impose a duty on the City

to perform any work which is required of any utility, and a failure of a utility to perform work required by this Ordinance shall
constitute a violation hereof.

provisions of this Ordinance in a civil action or suit brought against the utility, or any of its officers, agents or employees.

SECTION 2. Streets. All streets shall be constructed and surfaced in accordance with applicable standard specifications of
the City. In a residentially zoned area, if the City requires a developer to install a street with pavement width greater than 36 feet to
provide an arterial street or traffic route, the City will pay only the portion of the pavement and rock base cost in excess of the cost of a 36
foot street. If the City determines a developer shall install a street with pavement width greater than 36 feet to provide a collector street or
traffic route, the City will have no obligation to participate in oversizing costs.
In a commercial or industrially zoned area, if the City requires a devel oper to install a street with a pavement width greater than
36 feet to provide a collector or arterial street or traffic route, the City will have no obligation to participate in oversizing costs.
In instances where streets will provide direct access for any residential zone utilizing a density of less than 21 dwelling units per
acre the developers shall provide excavation and embankment for every right-of-way within their development from the back of the curbs
and/or sidewalks to the property line to a vertical grade not to exceed five (5%) percent.
In all other instances developers shall provide excavation and embankment behind the curb and/or sidewalk to plus or minus five
(5%) percent vertical grade for a total width of fifty-two (52) feet for a thirty-six (36) foot wide street and sixty (60) feet for a forty-four
(44) foot wide street.
If after construction of the street the land requiring access is changed to any residential zone utilizing a density of less than 21
dwelling units per acre, the developer making the change to any residential zone utilizing a density of less than 21 dwelling units per acre

sufficient size to meet all demands including fire flow demands, actual and potential, of the area being developed. The sizes required shall
be established by the Public Works Director in accordance with acceptable engineering standards, but in no case, except in certain dead
end water line instances recognized by the Public Works Director, shall this size be less than six (6") inches in diameter. Should the City
require water line sizing in excess of that normally required for the area being developed the City shall reimburse the developer in the

developed on an incremental basis, only those portions submitted for review or inspection shall be subject to
such deposit. In consideration of the City not requiring deposits twice as large as those proposed herein, as

any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other
pollutant specific limitation developed by the City or State. (Comment: Dilution may be an acceptable means
of complying with some of the prohibitions set forth in Section 3, e.g. the pH prohibition.)
SECTION 10.
8/10/2020 3237.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11388 6/15
A. Accidental Discharges. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this Ordinance. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user’s own cost and expense. Detailed
plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for
review, and shall be approved by the City before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete
such a plan by January 1, 1983. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of

have been approved by the City. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this Ordinance. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
B. Written Notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the
Superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
C. Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall
insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.

of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to the
Superintendent a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the
regulated process which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and Requirements and the average and
maximum daily flow for those process units in the user facility which are limited by such Pretreatment
Standards or Requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a qualified
professional.
B. Periodic Compliance Reports.
(1) Any user subject to a Pretreatment Standard, after the compliance date of such Pretreatment
Standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall
submit to the Superintendent during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in
the Pretreatment Standard or by the Superintendent, a report indicating the nature and concentration, of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such Pretreatment Standards. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow
reported in paragraph A of this Section. At the discretion of the Superintendent and in consideration of
such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Superintendent may agree to
alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
(2) The Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet
applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass
limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by Pretreatment Standards in the effluent of the user. These
reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Superintendent, of pollutants
contained therein which are limited by the applicable Pretreatment Standards. The frequency of
monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable Pretreatment Standard. All analysis shall be performed in
accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the
Administrator. (Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the
pollutant in question sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures est forth
and approved by the Administrator.)
SECTION 16. Monitoring Facilities. Users shall provide and operate at the user’s own

https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11388 9/15
and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises,
but the City may, when such a location would in the City’s opinion be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not
be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. Users must obtain the prior written approval of City to locate
such a facility on their premises.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided
in accordance with the City’s requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
SECTION 17. Inspection and Sampling. The City shall have the right to inspect the facilities
of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this Ordinance is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the
City or their representative ready access at all reasonable times day or night to all parts of the premises for the
purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The City,
approval authority, and (where the NPDES State is the approval authority). EPA shall have the right to set up
on the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with
their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City, approval
authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.
SECTION 18. Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with all Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the
Federal Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the
City shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be
acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Ordinance. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the City prior to the
user’s initiation of the changes.
All records relating to the compliance with Pretreatment Standards shall be made available to officials of
the EPA or approval authority upon request, and upon their payment to City of the normal and customary fees
for inspection of such records.
SECTION 19. Confidential Information. Information and data on a user obtained from
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction and upon the payment to City of the
normal and customary fee for inspection of such records unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available
upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this Ordinance, the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, State Disposal System and/or the Pretreatment Programs;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the State or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
SECTION 20. Just and equitable charges for sewerage service or subsequent service, maintenance,
operation, extension and construction are hereby levied and imposed upon all water users within the City using

by strict enforcement of a two hour parking limit, and

Volunteer Parking Permits, the Manager may authorize at least one, but not more than three, such
parking permits for the agency. Such permits shall remain the property of the City and shall be

be subject to the two hour parking restrictions imposed by this Ordinance, but shall be subject to all
other requirements and prohibitions in this Ordinance or as otherwise may be imposed by law.

space, and in the event a vehicle does remain parked in such a space for a period longer than 24 hours,
it shall again be subject to citation for over parking notwithstanding the provisions of this Section.
Permits shall be numbered and identify the agency to which the permit was issued, as well as its
expiration date. No such permit shall be valid unless it bears the signature of the City Recorder and
seal of the City, and is issued by the authorized agency to a volunteer suffering the health, age or
disability factors described herein, and only during hours of actual volunteer work. Permits shall be
retained by such agencies when not in actual use.

A. When a vehicle is placed in a manner or location that constitutes an obstruction to traffic or a hazard
to public safety, in a police officer’s opinion, then that officer may order the owner or operator of the vehicle to
remove the vehicle. If it appears to the officer that the vehicle is unattended, the officer may cause the vehicle
to be towed and stored at the owner’s expense. The owner shall be liable for the costs of towing and storing,
even if the vehicle was parked by another person or was initially parked in a safe manner but subsequently
became an obstruction or hazard.
B. The disposition of any vehicle towed and stored under authority of this Ordinance shall be in
accordance with the provision of this Ordinance.

C. Impoundment of any vehicle pursuant to this Ordinance does not preclude the issuance of a citation
for a violation of any provision of this Ordinance.
D. Whenever a police officer observes a vehicle parked in violation of a provision of this Ordinance or a
violation of State law, if the vehicle has any unpaid parking violations outstanding against it, the officer may, in
addition to issuing a citation, cause the vehicle to be impounded. A vehicle so impounded shall not be released
until all outstanding fines and charges have been paid. Vehicles impounded under authority of this Section
shall be disposed of in accordance with this Ordinance.
E. Whenever a person fails to make payments or satisfactory arrangements within 10 days of the date of
a letter sent pursuant to Section 53 E then a police officer may cause the vehicle to be temporarily immobilized
by installing on the vehicle or attaching to the vehicle a device designed to restrict the normal movement of the
vehicle. In the event that a temporary immobilization device is employed then the Police Department shall fix
a written notice as stated below using the records of the Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles, or any other
record readily available to the Police Department and mail notice as stated below.
(1) Unless release of the temporarily immobilized vehicle is arranged within eight (8) hours of the
immobilization by the Police Department it may be removed from its location as provided in this
Ordinance.
(2) The notice required above shall contain:
(a) The name of the City employee ordering the temporary immobilization.
(b) A description of the vehicle and its location.
(c) A statement of the reason for the temporary immobilization of the vehicle.
(d) Where the owner, driver, or person in charge of such vehicle may obtain release of the
vehicle.
(e) The date and the time when the City will have the vehicle towed and stored at the owner’s
expense, and a warning that this could result in the ultimate sale of the vehicle to satisfy expenses of
the temporary immobilization, towing, and any unpaid and due parking tickets if the owner fails to
redeem the vehicle.
(f) A statement that attempting to remove the immobilization device or removing it or
attempting to move or moving the vehicle before it is released is a violation of this Ordinance.
(3) It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or attempt to remove any temporary immobilization
device before a release is obtained as provided in this Ordinance, or to remove any such vehicle before it is
released by the Police Department, Clerk of the Municipal Court, or the Municipal Court Judge. A fee of
$10.00 shall be charged by the Police Department or Clerk of the Municipal Court before it shall be
released. The parking restrictions which would otherwise be applicable shall not apply during the time the
vehicle is immobilized by the temporary immobilization device.
(4) No person other than an officer of the City of Pendleton may remove or attempt to remove the
temporary restraining device or move or attempt to remove the vehicle before it is released by the Police
Department or the Clerk of the Municipal Court.
(5) A vehicle shall be released and the temporary immobilization device removed only after the
owner, operator, or person in charge of the vehicle does the following:
(a) Post bail and pays all fines and bail for parking citations issued against the vehicle, its
operator or owner; or
(b) Presents clear and convincing information to an employee of the City designated by the
Municipal Judge to receive such information that the present owner of the vehicle did not own the
immobilized vehicle at the time the parking citations were issued that established the violations, or
that the bail and fines for parking citations had been paid before the vehicle was temporarily
immobilized.
(c) A City employee designated by the Municipal Judge may for good cause extend the time
limit the temporary immobilization device is left attached to a vehicle before it is towed and stored
provided the owner, in writing, assumes all risk of damage to the vehicle while it remains
immobilized. The extension of the time limit shall not exceed an additional 24 hours, excluding
Sundays and Holidays.
F. Whenever a person fails to make payments or satisfactory arrangements within ten (10) days of the
date of a letter sent pursuant to Section 53 D then a police officer may cause the vehicle to be impounded
wherever the officer finds the vehicle and it shall not be released until all outstanding fines and charges,
including towing and storage, have been paid and if said fines and charges have not been paid within 60 days
the vehicle may be disposed of as described of herein.

City of Pendleton, Oregon Ordinance No. 3311
ORDINANCE No. 3311
AN ORDINANCE GRANTING A NON-EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE TO MICRO CABLE
COMMUNICATIONS CORP., DOING BUSINESS AS PENDLETON CABLE COMPANY, ITS
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, TO BUILD, CONSTRUCT, OPERATE, AND MAINTAIN A CABLE
TELEVISION SYSTEM IN THE CITY OF PENDLETON, UMATILLA COUNTY, OREGON, AND
SETTING FORTH CONDITIONS ACCOMPANYING THE GRANTING OF THIS FRANCHISE;
ESTABLISHING AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FIRST DAY OF NOVEMBER, 1984; AND REPEALING
ORDINANCES No. 2871 AND 3090.
CITY OF PENDLETON ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:
SECTION 1. This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the Pendleton Cable Company Franchise Ordinance.
SECTION 2. This Ordinance was passed after a full, open, and public hearing upon prior notice and opportunity of all
interested parties to be heard and upon careful consideration of Micro Cable Communications Corp. doing business as Pendleton
Cable Company’s qualifications, including its legal, character, financial and technical qualifications, and the adequacy and feasibility
of its construction arrangements.
SECTION 3. Definitions. For the purpose of this Ordinance, and when not inconsistent with the context, words used herein
in the present tense include the future; words in plural include the singular, and vice versa. The word “shall” is always mandatory. The
captions supplied herein for each section are for convenience only. Said captions have no force of law, are not part of the section, and
are not to be used in construing the language of the section. The following terms and phrases, as used herein, shall be given the
meaning set forth below:
“Amplifiers,” are devices used to boost or strengthen the electronic signal which is being transmitted through the cable to
subscribers’ television sets. They are generally spaced at certain intervals along the cable to rebuild the strength of the signal which
becomes weakened as it travels through the cable. Examples of often used amplifiers are:
(a) Bridge Amplifiers or “Bridgers.” These are connected to the main trunk cable and generally used as a “bridge” to take
the signal off the trunk line and direct it into the feeder or distribution cables branching off the trunk cable to subscribers’
residences;
(b) Cascade Amplifiers. These amplifiers are connected directly to the trunk cable in a series. They are spaced at certain
optimum intervals to repeatedly strengthen the television signal as it travels along the cable; and
(c) Line Extender Amplifier or Distribution Amplifier. As the terms imply, such amplifiers are used in the feeder or
distribution system to give one final boost to the television signal before it reaches the subscriber’s receiver.
“Attenuation.” This is the term used to describe the weakening in the strength of the television signal as it passes through the
cable system. For example, as the signal passes through any part of the system, such as the coaxial cable, amplifiers or taps it meets
resistance and loses a measurable part of its strength. This is known as attenuation.
“Bandwidth.” This term describes the electromagnetic frequency spectrum for a particular use or capacity. For example, a single
television channel has a designated bandwidth of 6 megahertz (6 million cycles per second). A cable system with a bandwidth capacity
of 300 megahertz (MHz) would seemingly carry 50 channels (300 MHz divided by 6 MHz per channel), but in reality such a system
usually carries approximately 35 channels because of spacing between channels.
“Broadband.” is a companion term to bandwidth. Broadband is generally used to describe a system or equipment with a wide
bandwidth. A modern “broadband” system today has the capacity to carry as much as 440 MHz of the electromagnetic frequency
spectrum on a single cable and some systems proposed for large metropolitan areas may have several cables with this capacity.
“Cable Services.” This is a general term which describes the various programming and other offerings to subscribers by cable
companies. Below is a description of some of the cable services currently offered on cable systems.
(a) Basic Services. This is the term used to describe certain cable services provided for a monthly subscription charge. This
service shall include the carriage of broadcast signals and FCC mandated non-broadcast services. It encompasses programming
not considered as ‘ancillary’ or ‘auxiliary’ services which include, but are not limited to, advertising, leased channels and
programming supplied on a per program or event basis if any.
8/10/2020 3311.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11383 2/8
(b) Pay or Premium Services. These services are offered to the subscriber for a per month or per view charge in addition to
the regular monthly basic service charge.
1
11-29
(c) Local Origination Services. This cable service is offered by the cable company which maintains sole control of the
content of the programming. The company may have a studio at its headend or the local operator may go to a site, such as a city
hall, school or the location of a special event to do the program with mobile equipment. This service should not be confused with
public access programming, which is controlled by the general public or a public agency rather than by the cable company.
(d) Public Access Services. These services are carried on channel space made available to the general public, local
governments, educational or other public institutions for their programming. This city requires such services through the franchise
negotiation or renewal process. Cable systems with at least twenty channel capacity shall set aside a minimum of ten (10%)
percent of its channels for public access programming.
(e) Leased Channel Services. These are channels leased by the cable company to persons or organizations for their use for a
fee. Cable systems with at least twenty (20) channel capacity shall set aside a minimum of ten (10%) percent of its channels for
lease by other persons on a nondiscriminatory basis, provided however eighty (80%) percent of that channel or channels can be
programmed by lessee. A typical lease channel service is professional sports programming in the ‘home’ town, state or region of a
team.
(f) Interactive Services. These services are available only where the cable system has a two-way or bi-directional capability.
(However, the telephone system can be used in conjunction with the cable services to create a type of “two-way” service.) The
following are examples of current interactive services.
(1) Pay Per View Services. With this service the subscriber has the ability to order the viewing of a certain event, such
as a first run movie or major sporting event, as opposed to monthly pay services, such as HBO, which offer preselected
programming at scheduled times.
(2) Alarm System Services. These are fire, police, medical alert or other alarm services generally monitored at a central
location for residences or businesses.
(3) Teleservices. These may be home shopping, banking, information gathering or other transactional services which
allow the subscriber to order information gathering or other transactional services which allow the subscriber to order
information, goods or services from home. There are several kinds of teleservices which involve varying degrees of control
by the subscriber, whether by electronic keyboard or decoder (Teletext) or by access to a central computer through the use of
home terminals, telephone lines or some other means of access (Videotex).
(4) Institutional Services. These services are usually an interactive loop tying together private businesses or public
institutions to allow television communication with branch offices or agencies. There are several applications of these
services, such as teleconferencing, training programs and interagency communications such as automated library circulation
systems and discrete police communications. However, by interconnecting institutional service loops with the residential
subscriber system at the headend, it is possible to deliver institutional programming to the residential subscriber as well.
(5) Utility Related Services. Examples include utility meter reading and monitoring and controlling of utility operations
centralized traffic signal control override capability to facilitate emergency vehicle travel for fires, police or other
emergencies.
“Cable Terminology.” In addition to the types of amplifiers described above, a cable television distribution system contains
several types of equipment and cables which make up the system. Some of the more commonly referred to components are as
follows:
(a) Trunk Cable. The major distribution cable of the system from which emanate the service branches of the system. The
trunk cable is either lashed to supporting wires called “strand” on utility poles leased from the local telephone or power company,
or it is placed underground in conduit or directly buried in generally the same location as underground telephone and power lines.
Cable companies, like the telephone industry, have begun to use fiber optic cable as an alternative, when feasible, to underground
coaxial cable.
(1) Coaxial Cable. Such cable is called coaxial because it consists of two conductors, one inside the other and having a
common axle. The inner wire is generally copper or copper-sheathed aluminum. Surrounding this inner wire is a
polyethylene or plastic insulating foam layer which is encased by a jacket of seamless aluminum or braided copper wire
covered by a durable plastic sheathing. An electromagnetic field is set up between the inner wire and the surrounding jacket
which retains the signals within it. Thus, the cable can carry a large number of signals with a minimum of leakage.

https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11383 3/8
(2) Fiberoptic Cable. This alternative to coaxial cable consists of very thin glass fibers which transmit light signals with
very little distortion and attenuation. These light signals can carry information through a process called “modulation,” which
ends up as television signals. The reduction in cable size and signal loss gives fiber optic cable a potential channel capacity
greatly in excess of conventional coaxial cable.
1
11-29
(b) Feeder or Distribution Cables. These are the intermediate cable lines generally running along neighborhood streets which
provide the connection between the main trunk cable and the final house lines that lead into a subscriber’s residence. Usually a
bridger amplifier feeds the signal to these lines.
(c) Drop Cable or Lines. These are the individual residence cables connected to the feeder lines by a device called a “tap” or
“drop.” They provide the signal to the subscriber’s television set.
“Channel,” “Channel Capacity.” A channel is a single path or section of the electromagnetic spectrum with a FCC assigned
bandwidth of 6 MHz. It carries a television signal, which is in turn composed of an audio (voice) signal and a video (visual) signal.
Channel capacity is a measurement of the maximum number of 6 MHz channels which can be simultaneously carried on a cable
television system. A cable system with a 35 channel capacity could not carry more channels without an upgrading or redesign of the
system which often will require a new system to be built. However, some existing systems have a larger capacity than there are actual
channels activated, and the cable operator could increase the number of channels used without a complete rebuild of the system.
“Character Generator.” A character generator is a video source for the purpose of providing data or characters generated for the
use of public access information.
“City” is the City of Pendleton, an Oregon municipal corporation.
“City Council” is the City Council of the City of Pendleton.
“City Manager” shall mean the City Manager of the City of Pendleton, or his authorized representative.
“Converter” is a device used to change the frequency of a signal. The most familiar converter is the set-top converter. This
changes the signals sent through the cable to meet the preselected channels on the subscriber’s television set in order that it can
receive more channels of programming. So called “cable-ready” television sets have a one-way converter function built into them and
can receive many channels of programming (some over 100) without the need for a set-top converter. However, since modern set-top
converters have other functions, such as being two-way and addressable, a set-top converter may be necessary to use all available cable
services in some systems, even if the subscribers’ television set is “cable ready.”
“Earth Station.” This term describes a facility which contains one or more antennas and associated electronic equipment to receive
signals from satellite(s). The typical earth station antenna is dish-shaped and is pointed at a satellite positioned in a geostationary orbit
above the earth (geostationary means that it stays in the same position above a certain part of the earth). Such satellites transmit signals
to earth stations in the wide geographical area (footprint) it covers.
“Federal Communications Commission” or “FCC” is the present Federal agency of that name as constituted by the
Communications Act of 1934, or any successor agency created by the United States of Congress.
“Grantee” is Micro Cable Communications Corp., doing business as Pendleton Cable Company, a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Oregon, and it is the grantee of rights under this franchise.
“Gross Monthly Service Revenue” shall include only payments made by subscribers for monthly service of said system and
excluded from the aforesaid shall be refunds or charges made on amounts received by the grantee for installations, converter rental in
subscribers homes, offices or businesses or for any other act or service.
“Headend;” “Hub.” The headend is the main electronic control center of a cable system. It is usually located at or near the earth
station or other antenna site of the system. Incoming signals are received, amplified, filtered, modulated and converted as necessary
and retransmitted through the trunk, feeder and distribution cable system to subscribers. A hub is generally an operational center
which is subservient to the headend, but from which main spokes of the system originate when a system covers a wide area. If the
system is large enough and requires antennas at each hub to receive signals, a headend and a hub may be virtually indistinguishable.
“Interconnection.” Generally, interconnection is the linking of different cable systems by connecting the headends of the systems
in a manner that subscribers of adjacent or nearby systems can receive the same programming simultaneously. The interconnection
can be accomplished by microwave relay, by coaxial cable, by fiber optic cable or otherwise. If the interconnection of facilities is done
on a fairly large scale, such as by satellite interconnection, it then is referred to or is known as a “network.”
“Person” is any individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company or organization of any kind.
“Regular Subscriber Services” shall include the carriage of broadcast signals and CC mandated non-broadcast services, but shall
not include “ancillary” or “auxiliary” services, which include, but are not limited to, advertising, leased channels, and programming
supplied on a per program or per channel charge basis, if any.
8/10/2020 3311.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11383 4/8
“Signals.” A general term for denoting an electromagnetic pulse communicated or transmitted in some manner, variations of
which are set forth below.
(a) Broadcast Signal. It is the transmitting of electromagnetic signals through the air in a multidirectional pattern to receivers
tuned to the specific frequency transmitted.
(b) Cablecast Signal. This is generally programming which originates on a cable system, such as local origination
programming or public access programming.
1
11-29
(c) Closed Circuit or “Discrete” Signals. These are signals transmitted to private subscribers directly, without access in any
manner by nonsubscribers.
(d) Distant Signals. They are television signals which originate at a point too far away to be picked up by ordinary home
reception equipment, as well as signals outside a broadcaster’s license area.
(e) Downstream; Upstream Signals. A downstream signal is one that travels from the headend or studio to the subscriber’s
residence. An upstream signal is one that originates with the subscriber and travels to the headend, studio or hub. These
designations have emerged with the reality of two-way or bi-directional systems.
SECTION 3. Grant of Authority. There is hereby granted by the City to Grantee the right and privilege to construct,
erect, operate, and maintain in, upon, along, across, above, over or under the streets, public alleys, public utility easements which allow
such use, public ways and publicly owned places now laid out or dedicated and all extensions thereof and additions thereto within the
City, all existing poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes, and other conductors and fixtures necessary for the
maintenance and operation in the City of a cable television system for the transmission of television signals and all other signals
permitted by the FCC, either separately or upon or in conjunction with any public utility maintaining the same in the City, with all of
the necessary and desirable appliances and appurtenances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this franchise and grant
shall and does hereby include the right in, over, under and upon the streets, sidewalks, public alleys, public utility easements which
allow such use, public ways and publicly owned places in the City to install, erect, operate or in any way acquire the use of, as by
leasing or licensing, all lines and equipment necessary to a cable television system and the right to make connections to subscribers
and the right to repair, replace, enlarge and extend said lines, equipment and connections. The rights granted herein for the purposes
set forth shall not be exclusive and the City reserves the right to grant a similar use of said streets, alleys, public utility easements,
public ways and publicly owned places to any person at any time.
SECTION 4. The Grantee agrees to keep and save the City, its officers, agents and employees harmless from any and all
liability, loss, cost, damage, attorney fees, or any other expense, for damage to persons, intangible rights, tangible rights, or property
arising out of the operation of cable services by the Grantee, its agents, servants, or licensees. The Grantee agrees to contract for and
maintain in full force and effect public liability insurance in amounts not less than hereinafter specified for the protection of the City
and the Grantee against liability, loss, damage, attorney fees, and other expenses, for damage to persons, intangible rights, tangible

$ 50,000Property Damage
$100,000 For death or injury to any one person in any one accident;
$300,000 For death or injury to two or more persons in any one
accident.
But in no case less than the City’s exposure under the Oregon Tort Claims act as it now exists or subsequently may be amended.
A copy of each insurance policy, or certificate thereof issued by a responsible and solvent corporation or association authorized to
issue such policy or policies under the laws of the State of Oregon shall be delivered to the City within a reasonable period of time after
the same is issued by the company or companies or associations issuing such policy or policies. The City may at any time require
Grantee to replace any policy or certificates with another policy or certificates where such a request is reasonably justified. All said
policies or certificates thereof shall provide for a minimum of thirty (30) days notice to the City in the event of cancellation or material
change in the terms thereof.
Grantee agrees that all subleasees under this franchise shall perform all the obligations of this Section, and if subleasees fail to
perform, then Grantee shall assume all of the duties and obligations of the sublease and save the City, its officers, agents, servants or

or aggressive behavior or otherwise threaten or endanger the safety of any domestic animal.

or aggressive behavior or otherwise threaten or endanger the safety of any person or any dog which previously

F. Notwithstanding subsections A through E of this section, the Police Chief shall have discretionary
authority to refrain from classifying a dog as potentially dangerous, even if the dog has engaged in the
behaviors specified in subsections A through E of this section, if the Police Chief determines that the behavior
was the result of the victim abusing or tormenting the dog. The Police Chief may decline to classify a dog as
potentially dangerous if, during the behavior in question, the dog or another person present were provoked by
wrongful criminal behavior or trespassing by the victim of the dog’s behavior, or other extenuating
circumstances . (Section 14, as amended by Ordinance No. 3404, passed November 17, 1987, Ordinance 3720

of the dog. These observations and testimony can be provided by Pendleton Police Officers, the Codes
Enforcement Officer, other employees of the City of Pendleton, or by other witnesses who personally observed

provide testimony regarding the dog's behavior if necessary.
B. The Police Chief shall give the dog's owner written notice and findings by certified mail or
personal service of the dog's dangerous specified behavior, of classification of the dog as a potentially
dangerous dog and of the additional restrictions applicable to that dog by reason of its classification level. The
notice shall include specific facts and findings to support the determination of the dog’s level of dangerousness
and the restrictions ordered.
C. An owner that has received notice of finding by the Police Chief of dangerous classification
and restrictions may request review of that finding to the Pendleton Municipal Court at 500 SW Dorion,

The request must be in writing, must make reference to the notice, and must be submitted within 10
days of the date the notice was mailed or personally served.
D. Within a reasonable time of a request for review the Municipal Court shall hold a hearing to
determine the following:
(1) Whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the dog engaged in the dangerous specified
behavior described in the notice;
(2) Whether the dangerous specified behavior was justified by circumstances described in
Section 14 F or other extenuating circumstances;

the dangerous specified behavior;

dangerous dog pursuant to this Ordinance, the owner shall comply with the restrictions specified in the notice
until such time as the Police Chief's, decision may be reversed on review by the Municipal Court. Failure to
comply with the specified restrictions pending the completion of all appeals shall be a violation of this
Ordinance for which a fine can be imposed. Additionally, the Police Chief shall have the authority to impound
the dog pending completion of all appeals.
F. The final determination of potential dangerousness of a dog under this ordinance by the Chief
of Police, or the Municipal Court upon review, shall be permanent and may not be subject to additional
reconsideration.

shall be marked with a permanent identifying mark. The Police Chief shall adopt rules specifying the character,
location and manner of this marking. (Section 15, as amended by Ordinance No. 3404, passed November 17,

been granted the right by the City to use the Airport in connection with the conduct of their air
8/10/2020 3432
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=17692 4/8
carrier or commercial operator business and who in consideration of fees or rent already make
payment to the City for that right through separate rents or fees.
(2) Guidelines.
The following guidelines shall be employed in granting an exemption:
(a) The burden shall be on the air carrier or commercial operator seeking the
exemption to prove by records satisfactory to the Airport Commission that:
(1) They are engaged as either an air carrier or a commercial operator, and
(2) They have been granted the right by the City to use the Airport in
connection with the conduct of their air carrier or commercial operator business, and
(3) They are making adequate payment and compensation to the City in
consideration of fees or rents, and
(4) That the gasoline, oil, or other propellant sought to be exempted from the
fees in this Ordinance are for use in their own aircraft; and
(5) That the gasoline, oil, or other propellant sought to be exempted from the
fees in this Ordinance are for use in the conduct of their own business.
(b) The purpose of this exemption is to avoid a hardship for air carriers or commercial
operators who already pay to the City rents or fees in consideration of their usage of the Airport
when using their own aircraft for their own business.
(3) The Airport Commission is hereby established as an Exemption Review Committee:
(a) The Committee shall meet to review all exemption requests and review them for
approval or disapproval. All requests shall be approved or denied within thirty (30) days of the
request.

concerned.

2016.)
SECTION 4. Automobile Rental Prohibited Without Lease. No person, firm or
corporation shall operate an automobile rental business at the Airport without having obtained a lease from the
City to operate such a business. Operation of an automobile rental business is defined as solicitation, offer to
rent, rent, deliver, check in, or advertisement of any rental cars on the Airport property, provided that a casual
or occasional delivery of a rental car shall not be the operation of an automobile rental business. (Section 4, as
amended by Ordinance NO. 3485, passed March 2, 1993.)

improvement upon lots which have been benefitted by all or part of the improvement.
T. “Special Benefit Only to Specific Properties” shall have the same meaning as “special and peculiar benefit” as that term is
used in Oregon Law (See ORS 223.389).
U. “Structure” means any temporary or permanent building or improvement to real property of any kind, which is constructed on
or attached to real property, whether above, on or beneath the surface.
V. “Treasurer” means the City elected or appointed official, however designated, charged by law with the responsibility for acting
as custodian of and investment officer for the public moneys of the City.
W. “True Cash Value.” In determining the “true cash value” of taxable property for the purpose of calculating the total amount of
indebtedness which may be incurred by the State or local governments under the Oregon Constitution or laws of the State of Oregon,
the “real market value,” as defined in Section 11 b (2)(a), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution, may be used if and to the extent that
the “real market value” does not exceed the “true cash value.”
X. In levying, collecting and enforcing assessments for local improvement, the following shall apply:
(1) Real property may be described by giving the subdivision according to the United States survey when coincident with the
boundaries thereof, or by lots, blocks and addition names, or by giving the boundaries thereof by metes and bounds, or by
reference to the book and page of any public record of the county where the description may be found, or by designation of tax lot
number referring to a record kept by the assessor of descriptions of real properties of the county, which record shall constitute a
public record, or in any other manner as to cause the description to be capable of being made certain. Initial letters, abbreviations,
figures, fractions and exponents, to designate the township, range, section, or part of a section, or the number of any lot or block or
part thereof, or any distance, course, bearing or direction, may be employed in any description of real property.
(2) If the owner of any land is unknown, the land may be assessed to “unknown owner,” or “unknown owners.” If the
property is correctly described, no final assessment shall be invalidated by a mistake in the name of the owner of the real property
assessed or by the omission of the name of the owner or the entry of a name other than that of the true owner. Where the name of
the true owner, or the owner of record, of any parcel of real property is given, the final assessment shall not be held invalid on
account of any error or irregularity in the description if the description would be sufficient in a deed of conveyance from the
owner, or is such that, in a suit to enforce a contract to convey, employing such description a court of equity would hold it to be
good and sufficient.
(3) Any description of real property which conforms substantially to the requirements of this section shall be a sufficient
description in all proceedings of assessment relating or leading to a final assessment for a local improvement foreclosure and sale
of delinquent assessments, and in any other proceeding related to or connected with levying, collecting and enforcing final
assessments for special benefits to the property.
SECTION 3. Plans and Specifications. Whenever the Council shall determine to proceed to make a local improvement
to be paid for in whole or in part by the property benefitted, the Council shall, by motion, direct the Manager to have a report prepared
containing the following information:
A. A description of the local improvement proposed.
B. Preliminary plans and outline specifications for such local improvement.
C. A description of the boundaries of the proposed local improvement district.
D. A just and reasonable method for apportioning the actual costs of the local improvement to the properties benefitted.
E. A list of the properties benefitted by such local improvement, including the name of the owner of each property benefitted,
and the address of such owner; the assessed valuation of each property, adjusted in accordance with Oregon law; and a statement of the
amount of outstanding assessments against any property proposed to be assessed by the improvement.
F. The estimated actual cost of the local improvement.
G. The estimated proportionate actual cost of the local improvement to be assessed to each benefitted property.
H. The estimated portion of the actual cost of the improvement to be borne by any City funds, if any.
I. This report shall be filed in the office of the Recorder when completed.
SECTION 4. Assessing. The Council shall consider the following in assessing costs of the local improvement:
A. The use of any just and reasonable method of determining the extent of the district boundaries consistent with the benefits
derived, the Oregon Constitution and Oregon Laws.
B. The use of any method of apportioning the actual cost or estimated actual cost to be assessed is just and reasonable among the
properties determined to be specially benefitted and consistent with the Oregon Constitution and Oregon Laws.
C. Payment by the City of all or any part of the actual cost or estimated actual cost of any improvement when, in the opinion of
the Council, on account of topographical or physical conditions, unusual or excessive use by the general public, or other character of
the local improvement, or when the Council otherwise believes it to be just and reasonable.
8/10/2020 3469.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11363 4/14
D. Other available means of financing the estimated actual cost of the local improvement, including federal or state grants-in-aid,
sewer service or other types of services or charges, revenue bonds, general obligation bonds, or other legal means of finance. In the
event any of such other means of finance are used, the Council may, subject to the constraints of the Oregon Constitution and Oregon
Laws, in its discretion, levy assessments for Local Improvement Districts hereunder according to benefits to cover any part of the costs,
subject to the constraints of the Oregon Constitution and Oregon Laws, of the local improvement not covered by such means.
SECTION 5. Resolution.
A. After the Manager’s report has been filed with the Recorder, and after the Council has examined such report and found the
same to be satisfactory, and the estimated cost and apportionment thereof to be reasonable and just, and after having found the
boundaries of such improvement district to be properly determined, the Council may, by resolution, propose to make such an
improvement, and to create a local improvement district.
B. The resolution shall state:
(1) The boundaries of such local improvement district.
(2) The proposed method of apportioning the estimated actual costs (estimated assessment) of the local improvement among
the property owners.
(3) The portion of the estimated actual cost, if any, which the City shall pay.
(4) That such portion of the estimated actual costs (estimated assessment) which are assessed to the property owners shall be
a charge and lien upon properties benefitted.
(5) The time and place for a public hearing.
(6) Direct the Recorder to provide a notice of said hearing as required by Oregon law which shall state that the Council shall
hear and consider objections or remonstrances to the proposed improvement by any parties aggrieved thereby. The notice shall
state that the Council, by resolution, has proposed to create the local improvement district and include the following:
“Unless those persons representing at least 66 2/3 percent of the proposed estimated assessment within said
local improvement district file with the City Recorder a written objection and remonstrance against such
proposed local improvement district prior to the public hearing or present their written or oral objections at
the public hearing, the Council shall be deemed to have acquired jurisdiction to order the formation of the
local improvement district to conform in all particulars to the plans and specifications previously adopted.
Any such objection or remonstrance shall state the objections and grounds for such objection or
remonstrance.”
SECTION 6. Notices.
A. Form of Notice. The Recorder shall also notify the owner of each lot proposed to be assessed by registered or certified mail,
or by personal delivery of the amount of the estimated assessment proposed for that property, the date by which time objections shall
be filed with the Recorder, and that any such objection shall state the grounds for the objection.
B. Delivery of Notice. Whenever a notice is required to be sent to the owner of a lot affected by a proposed assessment such
notice shall be addressed to the owner or his agent. If the address of the owner or his agent is unknown to the Recorder, the Recorder
shall mail the notice addressed to the owner or his agent at the city where such property is located. Any mistake, error, omission, or
failure with respect to such mailing shall not be jurisdictional or invalidate the assessment proceedings, but there shall be no
foreclosure or legal action to collect until notice has been given by personal service upon the property owner, or, if personal service
cannot be had, then by publication once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of
Pendleton.
SECTION 7. Prevention by Remonstrances. If those persons representing 66 2/3 percent or more of the proposed
assessment within the local improvement district file with the Recorder a written objection or remonstrance against the proposed
improvement such remonstrance shall be a bar to any further proceeding in the making of such improvement for a period of six
months.
SECTION 8. Ordinance Creating Local Improvement District.
A. Public Hearing. After the public hearing, if the local improvement district has not been objected to by those persons
representing at least 66 2/3 percent of the proposed assessment, the Council may provide for the creation of the local improvement
district by ordinance. This ordinance shall describe the improvement(s) to be made and the boundary of the local improvement
district. The Ordinance shall also provide that the estimated assessments against the properties benefitted shall be charges and liens
against the property. The City may enforce collection of such assessments as provided by Oregon law.
8/10/2020 3469.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11363 5/14
B. Adoption Process. In creating the local improvement by ordinance, the Council shall consider the objections or remonstrances
made and the reasons stated for them. The Council may adopt, correct, modify or revise the proposed assessments or estimated
assessments and shall determine the amount of assessment or estimated assessment(s), and shall determine the amount of assessment or
estimated assessment to be charged against each lot within the district, according to the special and peculiar benefits accruing thereto
from the improvement and shall by ordinance spread the assessments. The estimated assessment lien shall continue until the time the
estimated assessments become a final assessment.
C. Plans. The Ordinance shall also direct the Manager to have detailed plans and specifications of the local improvement
prepared and that, when appropriate, the City invite bids for construction of the local improvement. All bidders shall be required to
submit a certified check or bid bond in an amount equal to five (5%) percent of their bid, and the contractor to whom the award is made
shall submit a performance bond in the amount of his bid at the time the contract is awarded. All bonds shall be with bonding
companies doing business in Oregon and given under Oregon law. Bonds shall incorporate the term of the plans and specifications and
must be approved by the City Attorney as to form.
SECTION 9. General Policy/Bids.
A. It shall be the general policy of the City of Pendleton to call for bids for making local improvements and to award the bid to
the lowest responsible bidder. However, this general policy shall not prohibit the Council from providing that the City construct the
local improvements rather than private contractors.
B. Separate Bids. In the event that more than one local improvement district shall be advertised for bids at the same time all
local improvement districts shall be bid separately.
C. Low Bid. The Council shall have the authority to accept the lowest responsive aggregate bid which is in the best interest of
the City for all of the local improvement districts bid at the same time, and allocate the proper amount of the total cost to each district
separately.
D. Council Discretion. The Council may reject any and all bids submitted. The Council shall not be required to accept any bid
for any individual district even though the same may comply with the requirements hereof when the aggregate bid fails to meet the
requirements of other local improvement districts then bid.
SECTION 10. Assessment Ordinance Procedures.
A. Initial Assessments. If the City Council determines that the local improvement district shall be created the City Council shall
provide for the assessment or estimated assessment of the benefitted properties, and for the apportionment of the assessment or
estimated assessment to the individual lots within the local improvement district by ordinance by one of the following methods:
(1) Actual cost of the local improvement, or
(2) The estimated actual cost of the local improvement.
B. Notice. The Recorder shall prepare the assessment or estimated assessment to the respective lots within the assessment
district and file it with the appropriate City office. Notice of such assessment or estimated assessment shall be mailed or personally
delivered to the owner of each lot proposed to be assessed, which notice shall state the amounts of assessment or estimated assessment
proposed on that property and shall fix a date by which time objections and the grounds for objections shall be filed with the Recorder.
Any objection shall state the grounds thereof. The City Council shall consider such objections and may adopt, correct, modify or
revise the proposed assessments and shall determine the amount of assessment to be charged against each lot within the district,
according to the special and peculiar benefits accruing thereto from the improvement, and shall by ordinance spread the assessments.
C. Actual Cost. In determining the assessments or estimated assessments for the local improvement the Council shall use the
actual cost which means all direct or indirect costs incurred by City in order to deliver goods or services or to undertake a capital
construction project. The “actual cost” of providing goods or services to a property or property owner includes the average cost or an
allocated portion of the total amount of the actual cost of making a good or service available to the property or property owner, whether
stated as a minimum fixed or variable amount. “Actual cost” includes, but is not limited to, the costs of labor, materials, supplies,
equipment rental, property acquisition, permits, engineering, financing, reasonable program delinquencies, return on investment,
required fees, insurance, administration, accounting, depreciation, amortization, operation, maintenance, repair or replacement and debt
service, including debt service payments or payments into reserve accounts for debt service and payment of amounts necessary to meet
debt service coverage requirements.
D. Lien. The assessment ordinance shall provide that the assessments or estimated assessments against the benefitted properties
shall be a lien against the assessed properties and that the City may enforce collection of such assessments as provided by Oregon law.
E. Estimated Cost. If the initial assessment has been made on the basis of estimated actual cost, and upon the completion of
work the cost is found to be greater or less than the estimated cost, the City Council shall make an assessment for the correct actual
costs. Proposed assessments upon the respective lots within the assessment district for the proportionate share of the change shall be
made; and notices shall be sent; opportunity for objection shall be given; such objections shall be considered; and determination of the
8/10/2020 3469.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11363 6/14
assessment against each particular lot, block or parcel of land shall be made as in the case of the estimated assessment; and the
assessment spread by ordinance.
SECTION 11. Lien Recording; Payments Over Time or by Cash.
A. If the City has proceeded to cause any local improvement to be constructed or made within the corporate limits of the City,
and has determined the final assessment for the local improvement against the property benefitted thereby or liable therefor, according
to applicable law, the City shall cause notice of the final assessment to be published. The notice shall identify the local improvement
for which the assessment is to be made, each lot to be assessed and the final assessment for each lot. In addition, the notice shall state
that the owner of any property to be assessed shall have the right to make application to the City for payment of the final assessment in
installments as provided in this Ordinance. A copy of the notice shall be mailed or personally delivered to the owner of each lot to be
assessed.
B. The owner of any property to be so assessed, at any time within ten (10) days after notice of final or estimated assessment is
first published, may file with the recorder a written application to pay:
(1) The whole of the final or estimated assessment in installments; or
(2) If part of the final or estimated assessment has been paid, the unpaid balance of the final assessment in installments.
C. At the option of the City, an installment application may be filed not more than ten (10) days after the notice of the final
assessment is first published.
D. The installment application shall state that the applicant does thereby waive all irregularities or defects, jurisdictional or
otherwise, in the proceedings to cause the local improvement for which the final assessment is levied and in the apportionment of the
actual costs of the local improvement.
E. The application shall provide that the applicant agrees to pay the final or estimated assessment over a period of not less than
ten (10) years nor more than thirty (30) years and according to such terms as the City may provide. The City may provide that the
owner of the assessed property may elect to have the final assessment payable over a period of less than ten (10) years and according to
such terms as the City may provide.
F. The application shall also provide that the applicant acknowledges and agrees to pay interest at the rate provided by the City
on all unpaid assessments, together with an amount, determined by the City, sufficient to pay a proportionate part of the cost of
administering the bond assessment program and issuing the bonds authorized under Oregon Law (ORS 223.235), including but not
limited to legal, printing and consultant’s fees.
G. The application shall also contain a statement, by lots or blocks, or other convenient description, of the property of the
applicant assessed for the improvement.
H. In connection with the final assessments for any local improvement, the City may establish a procedure by which an owner of
any property to be assessed may irrevocably elect in writing to have the final or estimated assessment levied for a number of years less
than ten (10), which shall be determined by the City. The written election shall:
(1) Be signed by the owner or a duly authorized representative of the owner;
(2) Contain a description of the assessed property and the local improvement for which the assessment is made; and
(3) Contain a statement by the owner acknowledging that the improvement is a local improvement as described in this
Ordinance, that payment of the final assessment against the properties benefitted by the local improvement plus interest may be
spread over at least ten (10) years and that, notwithstanding any provision of law, the owner consents to make payments over a
period of less than ten (10) years and to have the assessment levied on the benefitted property accordingly.
I. The election of this section shall be recorded in the bond lien docket for the local improvement to which the assessment
relates. From and after the time at which the written election is so recorded, it shall be valid and binding upon all subsequent owners of
the property or any part thereof.
J. When a bond lien docket is made up, as provided in Oregon Law (ORS 223.230), as to the final assessments for any local
improvement, the City shall by ordinance or resolution authorize the issue of its bonds pursuant to the applicable provisions of Oregon
Law (ORS Chapter 288).
K. The bonds authorized to be issued under this section shall be issued in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of all final
assessments for the related local improvements including the amounts necessary to fund any debt service reserve and to pay any other
financing costs associated with the bonds.
L. Bonds.
(1) If the question of the issuance of the specific bonds has been approved by the electors of the City and the bonds are issued
as general obligation bonds, the City shall each year assess, levy and collect a tax on all taxable property within its boundaries.
The amount of the tax shall be sufficient to pay all principal of and interest on the bonds that are due and payable in that year and
to replenish any debt service reserves required for the bonds. In computing the amount of taxes to impose, the City shall deduct
from the total amount otherwise required the amount of final installment payments which are pledged to the payment of the bonds
8/10/2020 3469.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11363 7/14
and which are due and payable in that year, and shall add to this net amount the amount of reasonably anticipated delinquencies in
the payments of the installments or the taxes.
(2) The taxes shall be levied in each year and returned to the county officer whose duty it is to extend the tax roll within the
time and in the manner provided in Oregon Law (ORS 310.060).
(3) The taxes shall become payable at the same time and be collected by the same officer who collects county taxes and shall
be turned over to the City according to law.
(4) The county officer whose duty it is to extend the county levy shall extend the levy of the City in the same manner as City
taxes are extended. Property shall be subject to sale for nonpayment of the taxes levied by the City in like manner and with like
effect as in the case of county and state taxes.
M. If the question of the issuance of the specific bonds has not been approved by the electors of the City and the bonds are issued
as limited tax obligation bonds, the City may, subject only to the limitations of Section 11 b (1), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution,
calculate, assess, levy and collect a tax on all taxable property within its boundaries in the manner provided in this Ordinance. The
amount of such tax shall be sufficient to pay all principal of and interest on such bonds which is due and payable in that year and to
replenish any debt service reserves required for such bonds, provided that if such bonds are issued as limited tax obligation bonds the
amount of such tax shall not exceed the amount permitted under Section 11 b (1), Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.
N. Security for Bonds.
(1) All bonds issued pursuant to this section, including general obligation bonds, shall be secured by and be payable from the
installments of final assessment with respect to which the bonds were issued.
(2) In the ordinance or resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, the City may:
(a) Provide that installments of final assessments levied with respect to two (2) or more local improvements shall secure
a single issue of bonds.
(b) Reserve the right to pledge, as security for any bonds thereafter issued pursuant to this section, any installments of
final assessments previously pledged as security for other bonds issued pursuant to this section.
(3) All bonds shall be secured by a lien on the installments of final assessments with respect to which they were issued. The
lien shall be valid, binding and fully perfected from the date of issuance of the bonds. The installments of final assessments shall
be immediately subject to the lien without the physical delivery thereof, the filing of any notice or any further act. The lien shall
be valid, binding and fully perfected against all persons having claims of any kind against the City or the property assessed
whether in tort, contract or otherwise, and irrespective of whether such persons have notice of the lien.
O. As additional security for any bonds issued under this section, including general obligation bonds, the City may pledge or
mortgage, or grant security interests in, its revenues, assets and properties, and otherwise secure and enter into covenants with respect
to the bonds, as provided in Oregon Law.
P. Authority of City to Borrow.
(1) The City shall have the power, at any time and from time to time after the undertaking of a local improvement has been
authorized, to borrow money and issue and sell notes for the purpose of providing interim financing for the actual costs of the local
improvement.
(2) Notes authorized under this subsection may be issued in a single series for the purpose of providing interim financing for
two (2) or more local improvements.
(3) Notes authorized under this subsection shall mature not later than one (1) year after the date upon which the City expects
to issue bonds for the purpose of providing permanent financing with respect to installment payments of the final assessments for
the local improvements.
(4) Any notes authorized under this subsection may be refunded from time to time by the issuance of additional notes or out
of the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section. The notes may be made payable from the proceeds of any bonds to be
issued under this section to provide permanent financing or from any other sources from which the bonds are payable.
(5) The City may pledge the payment of bonds authorized to be issued under this section with respect to the local
improvements for which the notes provide interim financing.
Q. The City may create, within the Bancroft Bond Redemption Fund maintained by the City as required by Oregon Law (ORS
223.285), separate accounts for separate issues of bonds or notes issued as provided in Oregon Law (ORS 223.235), and may pledge
any amounts deposited in the separate accounts to specific issues of bonds or notes without pledging the amounts to any other issues of
such bonds or notes.
R. The installments due and payable under an assessment contract shall be due and payable periodically as the City shall
determine but shall not be due and payable over a term in excess of thirty (30) years. Each installment is due and payable with interest
as described under subsection T of this section.
S. The installments and interest are payable to the treasurer by the property owner whose application to pay the cost of the local
improvement by installments has been filed as provided in Oregon Law (ORS 223.210).
8/10/2020 3469.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11363 8/14
T. The amount of each installment (percentage of the total final assessment) shall be determined by the City and shall be as
appears by the bond lien docket described in Oregon Law (ORS 223.230). Each installment shall be due and payable with the accrued
and unpaid interest on the unpaid balance of the final assessment amount at the rate per annum determined by the City under Oregon
Law (ORS 223.215).
U. The first payment shall be due and payable on the date that the City shall determine, and subsequent payments shall be due
and payable on subsequent periodic dates thereafter as shall have been determined by the City.
V. If the owner neglects or refuses to pay installments under Oregon Law (ORS 223.265) as they become due and payable for a
period of one (1) year, then the City may, by reason of the neglect or refusal to pay the installments, and while the neglect and refusal
to pay continues, pass a resolution:
(1) Giving the name of the owner then in default in the payment of the sums due;
(2) Stating the sums due either principal or interest and any unpaid late payment penalties or charges;
(3) Containing a description of the property upon which the sums are owing;
(4) Declaring the whole sum, both principal and interest, due and payable at once.
W. The City may then proceed at once to collect all unpaid installments and to enforce collection thereof, with all unpaid late
payment penalties and charges added thereto, in the same manner in which delinquent property taxes are collected under applicable law
or, in the case of a City, in the same manner as street and sewer assessments are collected pursuant to the terms of the City Charter.
SECTION 12. Parking and Other Special City Improvements. The City may finance parking facilities by any
one or any combination of the following methods:
A. General obligation bonds within the legal debt limitations, or revenue bonds payable primarily or solely out of revenue from
parking facilities in such amounts, at such rate of interest, and upon such conditions as may be prescribed by the legislative authority of
the City.
B. Special or benefit assessments equal to the actual costs of the parking facilities, or a portion thereof, such assessment to be
levied against property benefitted in proportion to the benefit derived, the amount of such assessment to be determined in accordance
with special assessment practices for local improvements as now or hereafter prescribed by the ordinances or charter provisions of the
City.
C. Parking fees, special charges or other revenue derived from the use of off-street parking facilities by motorists, lessees,
concessionaires, commercial enterprises or others.
D. General fund appropriations.
E. State or federal grants or local aids.
F. Parking meter revenue.
G. General property taxes, or gift, bequest, devise, grant or otherwise.
H. A reasonable annual fee on the privilege of occupying real property within the City or a district of the City to carry on a
business, occupation, profession or trade. In levying the fee, the City shall take into consideration the unmet off-street parking
requirements of such business. The proceeds of the fee, less refunds and costs of collection, shall be used solely for the purposes of
ORS 223.805 to 223.845. The fee is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other tax, assessment or fee required by state or local law or
ordinance.
SECTION 13. Errors in Assessment Calculations. Claimed errors in the calculation of final assessments shall be
called to the attention of the Manager prior to any payment on account. The Manager shall check the calculation and report his
findings to the Council. If an error has been made the Council shall amend the final assessment ordinance to correct the error. Upon
the enactment of such an amendment by the Council, the Recorder shall make the necessary correction in the lien docket and shall send
by registered or certified mail to the owner a corrected notice of the assessment.
SECTION 14. Authority of City to Make Reassessment. Whenever all or part of any assessment for
improvements was or is declared void or set aside for any reason or its enforcement refused by any court by reason of jurisdictional or
other defects in procedure, whether directly or by virtue of any court decision or when the Council is in doubt as to the validity of all or
part of any such assessment by reason of such defects in procedure, the Council may by ordinance make a new assessment or
reassessment with respect to all or part of the original assessment upon the lots which have been benefitted by all or part of the
improvement to the extent of their respective and proportionate shares of the full value of such benefit.
SECTION 15 Basis for, Amount and Method of Reassessment. The reassessment shall be based upon the special
and peculiar benefit of the improvement to the respective lots at the time of the original making of the improvement. The amount of
the reassessment shall not be limited to the amount of the original assessment but the property embraced in the reassessment shall be
8/10/2020 3469.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11363 9/14
limited to property embraced in the original assessment. However, property on which the original assessment was paid in full shall not
be included in the reassessment. Interest from the date of delinquency of the original assessment may be added by the Council to the
reassessment in cases where the property was included in the original assessment, but such interest shall not apply to any portion of the
reassessment that exceeds the amount of the original assessment. The reassessment shall be made in an equitable manner as nearly as
may be in accordance with the law in force at the time the improvement was made, but the Council may adopt a different plan of
apportioning benefits or exclude portions of the district when in its judgement it is essential to secure an equitable assessment. Credit
shall be allowed on the new assessment for all payments made on the original assessment.
SECTION 16. Effect of Reassessment; Exceptions. The reassessment when made shall become a charge upon the
property upon which it is laid notwithstanding the omission, failure or neglect of any officer, body or person to comply with the
provisions of the charter or law connected with or relating to the improvement and original assessment or any previous reassessment,
and although the proceedings of the Council or the acts of any officer, contractor or other person connected with the improvement or
assessment may have been irregular or defective, whether such irregularity or defect was jurisdictional or otherwise. The reassessment
shall not be made in case of any improvement wherein a remonstrance sufficient in law to defeat it has been duly filed prior to the
making of the improvement.
SECTION 17. Council Resolution to Reassess. The proceedings required by the charter or other law for making of
the original assessment are not required with reference to the making of a reassessment. The reassessment shall be initiated by
adoption of a resolution designating the improvement as to which a reassessment is contemplated, describing the boundaries of the
district that the Council contemplates for the reassessment and directing the Recorder or other person to prepare a proposed
reassessment upon the property included within the district. After passage of such resolution, the Recorder or other person shall
prepare the proposed reassessment and file it in the office of the Recorder.
SECTION 18. Publication of Notice of Reassessment; Contents. After the proposed reassessment is filed in
the Recorder’s office, the Recorder shall give notice thereof by not less than four (4) successive publications in a newspaper published
in the City and, if there is no newspaper published in the City, in a newspaper to be designated by the Council. The notice shall show
that the proposed reassessment is on file in the office of the Recorder, giving the date of the passage of the resolution authorizing it, the
boundaries of the district or a statement of the property affected by the proposed reassessment, and specifying the time and place where
the Council will hear and consider objections to the proposed reassessment by any parties aggrieved thereby.
SECTION 19. Personal Notice to Each Owner; Right to File Objections. The Recorder shall, within five
(5) days after the date of first publication of the notice, mail or personally deliver to the owner of each lot affected by the proposed
reassessment, or to the agent of such owner, a notice of the proposed reassessment, stating the matters set out in the printed notice and
also the amount proposed to be charged against the lot. If the address of the owner or of the owner’s agent is unknown to the Recorder,
he shall mail the notice addressed to the owner or owner’s agent at the city where such property is located. Any mistake, error,
omission or failure with respect to such mailing shall not be jurisdictional or invalidate the reassessment proceedings. The owners of
any property included in the description of the printed notice, or any person having an interest in that property, may, within ten (10)
days from the day of last insertion of the printed notice, file in writing with the Recorder objections against the proposed reassessment.
SECTION 20. Hearing on Objections; Revision of Reassessment. At the time and place appointed in the
notice the Council shall hear and determine all objections filed under Section 19 of this Ordinance. The Council may adjourn the
hearing from time to time, and correct, modify or revise the proposed reassessment or set it aside and order the making of a new
proposed reassessment. However, if the proposed reassessment is corrected or revised so as to increase the amount proposed to be
charged against any property, such reassessment shall not be made until after a new notice has been given as stated in Section 19 of this
Ordinance to the owners of property against which the amount of assessment is proposed to be thus increased. The publication of the
notice may be for not less than two (2) successive insertions in a newspaper as provided in Section 18 of this Ordinance, and the time
when action may be taken thereon may be not less than five (5) days after the date of last insertion. If the proposed reassessment is set
aside and a new apportionment ordered, notice shall be given of the new apportionment in the manner stated in Sections 18 and 19 of
this Ordinance and action taken thereon as provided in Section 19 and this section.
SECTION 21. Reassessment Ordinance. When the Council has determined what in its judgement is a fair, just and
reasonable reassessment, it shall pass an ordinance setting out and making the reassessment. The reassessment so made shall be
deemed to be regular, correct, valid and just, except as it may be modified under Sections 22 and 23 of this Ordinance.

SECTION 22. Lien Docket Entry; Crediting Prior Payments. When the reassessment is duly made it shall be
entered in the City lien docket. All provisions for bonding and paying by installments shall be applicable, and such City liens shall be
enforced and collected in the manner provided for collection of liens for an original improvement. All sums paid upon the former
assessment or any previous reassessment shall be credited to the property on account of which it was paid and as of the date of
payment.
SECTION 23. Right of Purchaser at Sale Under Prior Assessment. In cases where a sale was made under
the original assessment or any previous reassessment, with reference to such improvement, and the property was not redeemed from
the sale, the purchaser at the sale is subrogated to the rights of the City with reference to the property upon such reassessment if the
purchaser waives all penalties and interest, except such interest as may be provided for on the reassessment, and delivers up for
cancellation any certificate or other evidence of the sale. If a deed was issued at the sale, the grantee therein, his heirs, executors,
administrators, successors or assigns, shall execute a deed of resale and quitclaim of all right, title and interest in the property under
such sale to the owner of the property and deliver the deed to the Recorder, so that the owner’s title may be cleared of the sale. The
Recorder shall act as escrow holder of such certificate or other evidence of sale and of such deed pending completion of reassessment.
If the reassessment is not completed, he shall return the certificate or other evidence of sale and the deed to the person delivering it to
him. If the reassessment is completed, the certificate or other evidence of sale shall be canceled and placed on file in the office of the
Recorder and the deed shall be delivered to the owner of the property specified therein. If any such purchaser, his heirs, executors,
administrators, successors or assigns fails to comply with this section, he is not entitled to subrogation. In any event, the amount of
subrogation shall not exceed the amount which has been paid to the City on such sale, together with interest at the rate established
under this Ordinance from the date of sale until the date of payment. This amount is to be paid by the City to the purchaser, his heirs,
executors, administrators, successors or assigns if and when the City collects the amount of the reassessment against the property.
SECTION 24. Review of Reassessment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Sections 15 through 25 of this
Ordinance, owners of any property against which a reassessment for local improvements has been imposed may seek a review thereof
under the provisions of Oregon law.
SECTION 25. Additional Reassessment Procedure; Time Limitation. No proceedings for making a
reassessment shall be instituted after twenty (20) years from the date when the first assessment was entered on the lien docket.
SECTION 26. Municipal Bonds Accepted as Payment for Assessment Liens. General obligation bonds or
interest coupons attached, or both, of the City are authorized for payment of all or any part of Local Improvement District liens, interest
or penalties of or payable to the City.
SECTION 27. Assessment of Public Property Benefitted by Improvements.
A. Whenever all or any part of the cost of public improvements is to be assessed to the property benefitted thereby, benefitted
property owned by the City, County, School Districts, State and any political subdivision thereof shall be assessed in the same as
private property and the amount of the assessment shall be paid by the City, School Districts, County or State, as the case may be,
provided that the costs of the improvements are, in any given case, of the type that may be bonded under this Ordinance.
B. In the case of property owned by the State, the amount of the assessment shall be certified by the City Treasurer and filed with
the Executive Department as a claim for reference to the Legislative Assembly in the manner provided by Oregon law unless funds for
the payment of the assessment have been otherwise provided by law.
SECTION 28. Public Roads Included in Sidewalk Improvement District; Assessment on Property
Benefitted. The City, in addition to powers granted by law or charter, may include in any sidewalk improvement district within the
City all county roads or state highways or any part thereof which are located within the improvement district. It may cause to be built
on the county roads or state highways or portions thereof within the improvement district, sidewalks for pedestrian travel, and may
assess the cost thereof upon the property benefitted thereby, in the manner provided by the Oregon Constitution, Oregon Laws, City
Charter and/or this Ordinance.
SECTION 29. Abandonment of Proceedings. The Council shall have full power and authority to abandon and
rescind proceedings for improvements undertaken hereunder at any time prior to the final consummation of such proceedings. If liens
have been assessed upon any property under this procedure, they shall be canceled, and any payments made thereon shall be refunded
to the payor, his assigns, or legal representatives.

https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11363 11/14
SECTION 30. Curative Provision. No improvement assessment shall be invalid by reason of a failure to give, in any
report, on the proposed assessment, in the assessment ordinance, in the lien docket or elsewhere in the proceedings, the name of the
owner of any lot or other parcel of land, or part thereof, or the name of any person having a lien upon or interest in such property, or by
reason of any error, mistake, delay, omission, irregularity, or other act, jurisdictional or otherwise, in any of the proceedings
hereinabove specified, unless it appears that the assessment as made, insofar as it affects the person complaining, is unfair and unjust,
and the City Council shall have power and authority to remedy and correct all such matters by suitable actions and proceedings.
SECTION 31. Special Provisions for Sanitary and Storm Sewers. When the Council finds that it is necessary
for the public health, welfare and safety and the individual property owner(s) have failed to meet routine obligations of owners that a
sanitary or storm sewer, or both, be constructed in an area within the City of Pendleton, the City shall, to the extent allowed by the
Oregon Constitution and Oregon Laws, proceed to form an improvement district and construct the improvements as provided in this
Ordinance whether or not such an improvement district has previously been rejected at any time by remonstrances. Property owners
shall have no right of remonstrance. Those parts of this Ordinance which are in conflict with this section shall not apply.

of a parcel of real property that was formed from the partition or other division of the larger tract of real property against which the
Local Improvement District assessment was originally levied.

mortgage or instrument evidencing the applicant’s ownership or other interest in the parcel, or

instrument evidencing the applicant’s ownership or other interest in the parcel in the Umatilla County Deed Records.
D. Any and all Local Improvement District assessments made by the City pursuant to this Ordinance shall be in the form of an

those smaller parcels so that each parcel shall be charged with the percentage of the remaining installment payments equal to the
percentage of the unpaid assessment charged to the parcel upon apportionment.
G. The City shall require each applicant to pay a deposit as established by the City before beginning the Local Improvement
District assessment apportionment process and the City shall require all applicants to reimburse the City for the actual costs as defined
in this Ordinance incurred by the City in apportioning Local Improvement District assessments under this provision.
H. The City’s Public Works Director shall establish regulations for the equitable apportionment of Local Improvement District
assessments pursuant to this Ordinance.
SECTION 33. Saving Clause. Ordinances No. 3185, 3259, and 3277 repealed by this Ordinance, shall remain in force
to the extent required to comply with Local Improvement District ordinances adopted prior to the date of this Ordinance.
SECTION 34. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Ordinance is for any
reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portions shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. This Ordinance is intended to

to secure revenue to assist in defraying the cost of providing police and fire protection and other municipal
services necessary for the implementation and the enforcement of this Ordinance.
B.The fee required by this Ordinance shall be in addition to general ad valorem taxes now or hereafter
levied under law and shall be in addition to license fees prescribed in other ordinances.
C.Neither the acceptance of the prescribed fee nor the issuance of the applicable license shall be construed
to constitute a regulation of any business activity or a permit to engage in any activity otherwise prohibited by
law or this Ordinance, or a waiver of any regulatory licensing requirement imposed by any Ordinance, State or
Federal law.

resolution and 50% of the employee (FTE) fee imposed by resolution shall be used for the operation of the
Pendleton Convention Center. The remainder of the employee (FTE) fee shall be deposited in the City’s
Central Services Fund to contribute to the cost of collection.
(Section 2, as amended by Ordinance No. 3752, passed August 21, 2007; Ordinance No. 3869, passed June 2,
2015.)

https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11362 2/17
(2)Civic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion
of social welfare, and the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational or
recreational purposes.
(3)Persons providing day care services for children in the person's home where the person has

nonprofessional services; for example, a shoe store, attorney's office, doctor's office, public accountant,

(2)Those persons whose physical plants or facilities are located outside of the City, but whose
business requires use of the City's streets or facilities and whose services or materials are rendered or
delivered within the City to the public; for example, a bakery truck delivering wares originating from
outside the City but delivered within the City to the public, and other retailers.
C.Public utilities covered by franchise ordinances and paying fees under the franchise are exempted from
the provisions of this Ordinance.
D. For the purposes of this Ordinance, each separate location of a business shall be considered a separate
business and each business shall pay the applicable business license fee required under this Ordinance. Any
branch of a business engaged in a separate business as defined in this Ordinance shall also pay a separate
business license fee.
E. If two (2) or more businesses are carried on at the same premises by the same owner, one (1) license
issued in the name of the business for which the premises is primarily used shall be sufficient for all such
activities. A business activity leased, under concession to, or owned wholly or in part by a different person or
persons on the same premises must be separately licensed. In determining whether different activities on the
same premises are related to the primary use within the meaning of this Section, normal and ordinary custom
and usage of businesses of like nature shall be considered. The City shall rely on the SIC code in determining
whether or not a business is a separate business.

G.For the purposes of this Ordinance, no person whose income is based solely on an hourly, daily, weekly,
monthly or annual wage or salary shall be considered a person transacting and carrying on a business. The
intention of the City Council is that all business fees levied by this Ordinance shall be borne by the employer or
proprietor for the privilege of doing business and shall not be borne by the employee as a cost of employment.
H.Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed to apply to any person transacting and carrying on any
business within the City which is exempt from a license fee or tax or regulation by virtue of the Constitution or
laws of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State of Oregon. Federal, State and municipal
corporations are exempt from this Act.

K.For the purpose of this Ordinance, no person who offers wholesale goods or wholesale services to a
business licensed in the City under this Act shall be required to obtain a business license under this Section of
the Business License Act. It is the intent of this Section to encourage those persons who offer goods and
services to businesses already licensed within the City under this Act to continue offering such goods and
services without requiring them to pay a business license fee and to encourage their continued offering of such
goods and services to businesses which are currently licensed in the City. This Section shall not allow such
supplying of goods or services to retail consumers or for house-to-house application in the City and is
specifically intended to be limited to those persons calling on businesses already licensed under this business
license ordinance. This Section does not allow supplying goods or services to businesses other than in a
wholesale capacity, specifically, those persons who furnish retail goods and services to businesses within the
City are required to pay a business license fee.

any activity for which registration with the State Construction Contractors Board is required pursuant to
8/10/2020 3471.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11362 3/17

other business licensed within the City under the Business License Act.
L.Children who are under the age of sixteen (16) years of age who are personally providing otherwise
legal goods or services are exempted from this Ordinance.
M.A “Full-Time Equivalent Employee” (FTE) is defined for those persons working for an hourly wage as
the total number of annual employee hours divided by 2,080. (For example, a restaurant which employed
fifteen [15] people who worked a total of 20,800 hours annually would have ten [10] full-time equivalent
employees [FTE].) A “Full-Time Equivalent Employee” (FTE) working for other than an hourly wage is
defined as those persons who work an average of twenty five (25) hours per week or more in exchange for their
salary, commission or other form of compensation. The Business License Administrator shall have the power
to adopt reasonable further definitions of Full-Time Equivalent Employee (FTE) consistent with this
Ordinance.

1997; and Ordinance No. 3752, passed August 21, 2007.)

as defined in this Ordinance, without first paying in advance the business fee imposed by this Ordinance and
obtaining a business license.

by the distributor, for use and operation, one or more devices required to be licensed by this Ordinance with
respect to Amusement and Music Devices.
Amusement device.
A. A mechanical, electronic, mechanical-electronic or nonmechanical device which is designed for
the amusement of the player or operator and is complete in itself, having as its purpose the production or
creation of a game of skill, amusement, entertainment, or test of strength, including, but not limited to,
shuffleboard, coin-operated devices using tables, boards, or cases of any size whatever, balls, sticks, cues, pegs
or marbles, whether or not any motivating force involved is furnished by the player or the device.

tangible personal property, such as cold drinks, tobacco products, candies, postage stamps, or other
merchandise; or services such as pay telephones, parking meters, gas and electric meters or other distribution of

SECTION 21. Purpose. The license fees required by this Ordinance with respect to
Amusement and Music Devices are for the purpose of regulating and supervising the use and operation of
amusement devices and coin-operated musical machines or phonographs. In this connection, experience has
proven that when such machines, games and devices are first installed, they need more checking, investigating
and supervision by City officials than they do later on. Experience also has proven that they are not desirable
in some locations, and if not operated in some locations with discretion they become a nuisance. The City
retains the right to deny any person the right to install coin-operated games, machines and devices in locations
where the City Council considers it in the best interest of the public that the machines, games and devices not
be installed, and the City reserves the right to require that any such machine, game or device be moved if the
City Council considers the removal in the best interest of the public.
SECTION 22. License Required. No person shall maintain, keep or display an
amusement device, musical machine or phonograph in a condition or position so that the machine or device
may be operated, played or used until a license has been obtained and attached to it, as required by this
Ordinance with respect to Amusement and Music Devices.

on the amusement device.

A. No license shall be required for entertainment, plays or amusement ventures given by local
talent for public charity.

for the general benefit of the community and sponsoring or operating a carnival, circus or theatrical show for a
period of not more than six (6) days without payment of the license fee or fees in this Ordinance.
SECTION 33. Exhibition of Prices. The prices to be charged for goods, wares,
merchandise or material vended at any circus, menagerie or carnival, or other facility used in connection with
any circus, menagerie or carnival shall be plainly marked over each concession or booth. The prices of

City of Pendleton, Oregon Ordinance No. 3504
ORDINANCE NO. 3504
AN ORDINANCE RELATING TO FEES FOR PUBLIC SAFETY PROTECTION CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENTS; AND DECLARING AN EFFECTIVE DATE. (As amended by Ordinance
No. 3667, 3751, 3829, 3842)
Enacted June 21, 1994; last amended August 1, 2013.
Whereas, there is a need for fire protection capital improvements; and
Whereas, the Oregon Constitution, Article XI, Section 11b (1990 Measure 5) significantly limits the city's ability to use
general obligation bonds for fire protection and other equipment purchases; and
Whereas, it is appropriate that the fees for fire protection capital improvements should be in proportion to the expected need
for the services;
Whereas, in order to provide for fire protection needs the City's water supply and distribution system is larger and more
costly than would be necessary for normal consumption; and
Whereas, the City has a large number of county, state, and federal government properties and other tax exempt properties that
increase the need for fire protection that do not contribute to the resources for fire protection capital improvements through real
property taxes; and
Whereas, fully sprinklered buildings significantly reduce the need for fire protection services; therefore
CITY OF PENDLETON ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:
SECTION 1. A fee for public safety protection capital improvements is imposed on each customer of the water utility
for which service is to one or more structures. No fee is imposed on water meters which solely supply fire suppression or sprinkler
systems.
(Section 1, as amended by Ordinance No. 3842, passed August 1, 2013)
SECTION 2. The fee for public safety protection services shall be included as a separate fee on the regular utility bill as
follows:
Single Family Residential $2.25 per month
All Other
Meter Monthly
Size Fee
5/8" to 1" $2.25
1" $9.00
2" $14.15
3" $27.00
4" $45.00
6" $72.00
8" $153.00
10" $342.00
This fee shall become effective on February 1, 2013. This fee will be adjusted annually based on the Portland, OR Consumer Price
Index (CPI) to the nearest $0.05, beginning April 1, 2014.

service.
SECTION 6. The regulations for payment of delinquent utility bills and for the collection thereof, as they are then in
effect, apply to the fee for fire protection capital improvements.
SECTION 7. The fees collected pursuant to this ordinance shall be deposited in a fund dedicated to the purpose of
making capital improvements for public safety protection purposes.
(Section 7, as amended by Ordinance No. 3842, passed August 1, 2013)

City of Pendleton, Oregon Ordinance No. 3514
ORDINANCE No. 3514
AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS FOR THE ALLOCATION OF WATER RESOURCES
TO BE EFFECTIVE WHENEVER THE PENDLETON CITY COUNCIL FINDS THERE IS A WATER
SHORTAGE EMERGENCY; AND PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THEREOF. (As
amended by Ordinance No. 3669, passed June 4, 2002.)
WHEREAS, the City of Pendleton is a water supplier, licensed by the Oregon State Health Division, Drinking Water Section; and
WHEREAS, the City desires to preserve the capability of the existing water sources to continue to meet the water demands of all
customers of the City’s water utility; and
WHEREAS, the City desires to increase the amount of water available from the present water sources for future growth of
customers; and
WHEREAS, the City’s Water Department (by metering of all permanent system users and the implementation of a permanent
audit system accounting for un-metered water -- e.g. water tanks on street flushers/fire trucks, estimates of fire usage, hydrant flushing,
etc.) can account for a minimum of ninety (90%) percent of all water produced; and
WHEREAS, the City has installed a Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) remote telemetry system for all
elements of the City’s water system; and
WHEREAS, the City’s primary goal is to increase the amount of water available from existing water sources for future growth,
through the implementation and encouragement of conservation measures, and thereby avoid the need for developing significant
quantities of additional water sources that may require extensive treatment to meet the standards of the Federal Safe Drinking Water
Act; and
WHEREAS, the City’s secondary goal is to provide water for continued growth for all types of customers. The City Council has
determined that it is timely and prudent to implement the policies herein that will result in a more efficient use of current water
supplies; and
WHEREAS, it is the City Council’s goal that the implementation of this Water Conservation Plan will result in a ten (10%)
percent reduction in the total annual water demand and summer peak demands (as corrected for factors impacting demand e.g.
population changes, weather, fire demands, etc.). Achieving this goal would, in effect, increase the capacity of the water system; and
WHEREAS, the potential for a drought, which may be coupled with other contributory factors, could further reduce the amount of
available water; thus, the City Council enacts this Ordinance to: (1) adopt a Water Conservation Plan; (2) encourage water
conservation; (3) provide for voluntary rationing during periods of mild water shortages; and (4) require the curtailment of the use of
water during more severe water shortages as defined herein; and
WHEREAS, after the adoption of this Ordinance, the City Council will continue to review the progress of this Water
Conservation Plan and direct the City Manager to implement necessary changes; and
WHEREAS, water rates will be evaluated as a part of the 1995 Water Master Plan and periodically thereafter; and
WHEREAS, certified businesses in the Pendleton Enterprise Zone that have a contract with the City with a special water rate
structure, as authorized by State Administrative Rules, shall have those rates honored as specified in the agreement with the City.
NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY OF PENDLETON ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:
8/10/2020 3514.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11353 2/5
SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS. As used in this Ordinance, the following terms shall have the meaning given herein:
“City” The City of Pendleton, Oregon.
1
3-9
“City Manager” The City Manager of the City of Pendleton or the manager’s designee.
“Customer” Any person using water supplied by the City.
“Person” Any person, firm, entity, partnership, association, corporation, company, or organization of any kind.
“Water” Water from the City, unless expressly provided otherwise or required by contract.
SECTION 2. APPLICATION. The provisions of this Ordinance apply to all customers using water provided by the City.
SECTION 3. EDUCATION AND INFORMATION. The City will inform the public of ways to conserve water and
why conservation is important by:
A. Distribution of educational materials to all customers once per year until the City determines there is no longer a need to do
so.
B. Submittal of conservation articles to the local newspaper and the local radio stations at times corresponding to the distribution
mentioned above and more often if conditions warrant.
C. Providing new customers with conservation information when they apply for initial water service. The City will maintain a
supply of printed materials available through private and public sources.
D. Encourage existing water users to replace their inefficient plumbing fixtures with new, low flow fixtures or to use retrofit kits.
The typical retrofit kits will consist of; toilet tank insert(s), low-flow showerhead(s), faucet flow restrictor(s), toilet leak detection dye
tablet(s) and an information guide. Information on other types of retrofits and other related conservation tips will be provided to water
customers.
SECTION 4. METERING. The Water Department will continue the policy of metering all water service connections
(customers, parks, public owned buildings, temporary construction, etc.) and production. The City will continue to test all meters
which appear to have abnormal water usage.
SECTION 5. WATER CONSERVATION DURING SUMMER IRRIGATION. The public information
program will include suggestions on landscaping and irrigation procedures which will reduce water use. The City will investigate and
may promulgate subdivision and development regulations which would encourage developers to plant only low water using plants and
grasses. Printed information on lawn irrigation, application rates, and types of drought resistant plants compatible with the area climate
will be pursued.
SECTION 6. LEAK DETECTION AND REPAIR. The City will start a water audit and leak detection and repair
program whenever the unaccounted for water exceeds ten (10%) percent of the water used by the system. The City will:
A. Check customer meters and plumbing which have high usage;
B. Monitor the water distribution system to identify leaks;
C. Monitor water system supply master meter(s) to identify abnormal conditions that could indicate a leakage or erroneous
recordings;
D. Institute a program to field check sections of the water distribution system by testing customer meters and listening for leaks
during low-use periods; and
E. Make needed repairs.
SECTION 7. PROMOTION OF CONSERVATION. This Water Conservation Program will be promoted by:
A. City staff will encourage builders to install plumbing fixtures that are water efficient, and the efficient use of water saving
landscaping when they apply for a new water service.
B. Reviewing the conservation effect of the current water rate structure. If after review of water usage, it is deemed necessary, a
new rate structure will be adopted which will encourage replacement of old inefficient plumbing fixtures and support more efficient
lawn and garden watering.
C. Develop policy and implement measures to control and/or eliminate all free water accounts. Pendleton presently provides
water free of charge to various non-profit organizations and agencies amounting to approximately 100 million gallons annually. Free
8/10/2020 3514.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11353 3/5
water accounts presently have little or no incentive to conserve water.
SECTION 8. WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS. The City currently has no wholesale customers. If the City sells water
to another water supplier in the future, the supply agreement will require that supplier to adopt a similar water conservation plan.
1
3-9
SECTION 9. VOLUNTARY WATER USE CURTAILMENT. Prior to enforcing a mandatory curtailment of
water consumption during a water shortage the City shall:
A. On a finding that there are factors and circumstances present that will result in water demands exceeding the capacity of the
City’s water sources (ninety [90%] percent of system capacity or above normal lowering of the water levels in wells), the City shall:
(1) Advise customers of the current water situation, and projected deficiencies of the current system to meet demands without
a voluntary reduction in the amount of water consumed, and
(2) Identify the percentage of voluntary reduction that is required to avoid a shortfall in the capability of the existing
source(s) to avoid the need to implement the mandatory cutbacks provided by this Ordinance.
(3) Communicate the need for voluntary reduction through:
a. Monthly utility billings,
b. Local media -- newspapers, radio, television, and
c. Printed materials posted in public places.
Included in the above announcements will be suggestions on how to accomplish the voluntary reductions.
If the voluntary reduction program is successful, the City will continue with the above steps until the voluntary reductions
are no longer necessary.
B. If the voluntary reduction program is unsuccessful, the City Manager will implement the appropriate curtailment sections of
this Ordinance.
SECTION 10. WATER CURTAILMENT PURPOSE AND INTENT. Whenever the City Council finds:
A. That a water shortage emergency condition prevails in the area served by the City, or
B. That the ordinary demands and requirements of water consumers cannot be satisfied without depleting the water supply of the
City to the extent that there would be insufficient water for human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection; the City Council shall,
by motion, impose a First Level of Curtailment or a Second Level of Curtailment as provided by this Ordinance.
SECTION 11. FIRST LEVEL OF CURTAILMENT.
A. Nonessential Residential Uses. During a first level of curtailment the following uses of water for residential purposes are
prohibited:
(1) The use of water to wash all types of motorized vehicles (for land, air, and water) except at commercial fixed washing
facilities existing prior to the enactment of this Ordinance or those that recycle or reuse the water.
(2) The use of water to wash down all types of permanent (horizontal or vertical) exterior hard surfaced areas.
(3) The use of water to fill, refill or add to any indoor or outdoor private swimming pool or jacuzzi pool except for
neighborhood fire control (when deemed necessary by the City Manager), except where the pools have recycling water systems
and evaporative covers, or where the use of the pool is required by a medical doctor’s prescription.
(4) The additional use of water in a fountain or pond for aesthetic or scenic purposes.
B. Nonessential Commercial, Institutional or Industrial Use. During a first level of curtailment the following commercial or
industrial water uses are prohibited:
(1) The use of water to serve a customer in a restaurant unless requested by the customer.
(2) The use of water for scenic and recreational ponds and lakes.
(3) The use of water from hydrants for construction purposes, fire drills, or any purpose other than fire fighting.
(4) The use of irrigation water for schools, parks, cemeteries, recreation areas, golf courses, community food gardens,
residential gardens, and similar recreation or memorial type facilities in excess of seventy-five (75%) percent of the normal
historical amount consumed.
(5) The use of domestic water for schools, nursery facilities, restaurants, shopping centers, gasoline service stations, health
and swim clubs, and all other commercial uses in excess of ninety (90%) percent of the normal historical amount consumed.
8/10/2020 3514.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11353 4/5
(6) The use of water for manufacturing, food processing, cooling or cleaning of equipment in excess of ninety (90%) percent
of the normal historical amount consumed.
(7) The use of water for agricultural irrigation in excess of seventy-five (75%) percent of the normal historical amount
consumed.
(8) The use of water for dust control.
C. Gutter Flooding. No person or customer shall cause or permit water to run to waste in any gutter or drain.
D. Discontinuance of Service. The City may, after one warning by certified mail or in person, disconnect the water service of
any person when the City Manager determines that the person has failed to comply with any provisions of this Ordinance.

(1) Payment of the turn off and on charge, as specified by the City’s general rate structure, and any other costs incurred by
the City in the discontinuance and restoration of the service; and
1
3-9
(2) The giving of suitable assurances to the City that the action causing the discontinuance will not be repeated.
In addition to the foregoing, the City may, prior to restoration of service, install a flow-restrictive device on the customer’s service.
E. Variances. The City Manager may grant temporary variances for prospective uses of water otherwise prohibited after
determining that due to unusual circumstances that failure to grant such variance would cause an emergency condition affecting health,
welfare, sanitation, or fire protection of the applicant or the public.
F. Appeal. The City Manager’s action to discontinue service or apply conditions regarding the restoration of service may be
appealed to the City Council. If the aggrieved person files notice with the City Manager within five days of notice of the action or the
proposed action, the action will be stayed pending a decision on the appeal.
No such variance shall be retroactive or otherwise justify any violation of this Ordinance occurring prior to issuance of the
temporary variance.
SECTION 12. SECOND LEVEL OF CURTAILMENT. In addition to the restrictions in Section 11, the following
curtailments may be enforced during a second level of curtailment:
A. 1 or 2 residential units - Daily usage allotment:
(1) one permanent resident 80 gallons
(2) two permanent residents 110 gallons
(3) three permanent residents 140 gallons
(4) each additional permanent resident 30 gallons
B. Multi-residential units (three or more units) - Daily usage allotment for each unit shall be 130 gallons per day.
Each customer in whose name water is supplied to a residence, or residences or apartments or other dwelling units, shall upon

herein provided for one permanent resident.
C. Other Nonessential Uses. All other uses of water not expressly set forth in this Ordinance in excess of seventy-five (75%)
percent of the normal historical amount consumed.
D. Determination of Amount of Prior Water Consumption. The normal historical amount of water consumed shall be determined
by the City utilizing historical records of the same time periods. Where no such records exist, the amount shall be the average use of
similar existing services as determined by the City from its records.
SECTION 12A. NEW PRIVATE DOMESTIC WELLS PROHIBITED. No person, in time of water shortage
emergency or otherwise, may drill, commission, or otherwise put into service a domestic water supply well. (Section 12A added by

City of Pendleton, Oregon Ordinance No. 3693
ORDINANCE NO. 3693
AN ORDINANCE CREATING THE CITY OF PENDLETON FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
REGULATIONS.
THE CITY OF PENDLETON ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:
SECTION 1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. The Legislature of the State of Oregon has in Oregon Revised
Statutes, Chapter 215, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Pendleton, does ordain as follows:
SECTION 2. FINDINGS OF FACT.
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Pendleton are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood
heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed,
elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
SECTION 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets,
and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to
minimize future flood blight areas;

SECTION 16. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
A. General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:
1. Anchoring
a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure.
b. All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be
installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited
to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (Reference FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood
Hazard Areas” guidebook for additional techniques).
2. Construction Materials and Methods.
a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant
to flood damage.
b. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize
flood damage.
c. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed
and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
3. Utilities.
a. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the system;
b. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,
c. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during
flooding.

8/10/2020 3702.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11341 4/7
percent (3%) of the Franchisee’s Gross Revenues (“Franchise Fee”). After the first five years of this Franchise, the Franchise shall pay
to City during the term of this Franchise an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Franchisee’s Gross Revenues (“Franchise Fee”)
B. Modification Resulting from Action by Law. Upon thirty days notice and in the event any law or valid rule or
regulation applicable to this Franchise limits the Franchise Fee below the amount provided herein, or as subsequently modified, the
Franchisee agrees to and shall pay the maximum permissible amount and, if such law or valid rule or regulation is later repealed or
amended to allow a higher permissible amount, then Franchisee shall pay the higher amount commencing from the date of such repeal
or amendment, up to the maximum allowable by law.
C. Payment of Franchise Fees. Payments due under this provision shall be computed and paid quarterly for the
preceding quarter, as of March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, each quarterly payment due and payable no later than
forty-five (45) days after such dates. Not later than the date of each payment, the Franchisee shall file with the City a written
statement, in a form satisfactory to the City and signed under penalty of perjury by an officer of the Franchisee, identifying in detail the
amount of gross revenue received by the Franchisee, the computation basis and method, for the quarter for which payment is made.
D. Interest; No Accord. Late franchise fee payments will be subject to late fees calculated on the basis of nine percent
(9%) per annum of the amount past due. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as accord that the amount paid is in fact the
correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim City may have for further or additional
sums payable under the provisions of this Franchise. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by City.
E. The Franchise Fee includes all compensation for the use of the City’s right-of-way. Franchisee may offset against the
Franchise Fee the amount of any fee or charge paid to the City in connection with the Grantee’s use of the right-of-way when the fee or
charge is not imposed under a generally applicable ordinance or resolution. The Franchise Fee shall not be deemed to be in lieu of or a
waiver of any ad valorem property tax which the City may now or hereafter be entitled to, or to participate in, or to levy upon the
property of Franchisee.
Section 13: Right to Inspect Records. In order to manage the Franchisee’s use of rights-of-way pursuant to this Franchise,
and to determine and verify the amount of compensation due to the City under this Franchise, the Franchisee shall provide, upon
request, the following information in such form as may be reasonably required by the City: maps of the Franchisee’s
telecommunications system; the amount collected by the Franchisee from users of Telecommunications Service provided by
Franchisee via its Telecommunications network; the character and extent of the Telecommunications Service rendered therefor to them;
and any other related financial information required for the exercise of any other lawful right of Franchisee under this Franchise. The
information or a signed statement verifying that no such information exists, along with any further directly related data which may be
required by the City to adequately understand the information, shall be furnished by the Franchisee to the City within thirty days of
when the City provides notice requesting such information, at the Franchisee's cost and expense. The City agrees that such information
is confidential and that the City will use such information only for the purpose of managing its rights-of-way, determining compliance
with the terms of this Franchise, and verifying the adequacy of Franchisee’s fee payments. The City further agrees to protect such
information from disclosure to third parties to the maximum extent allowed by Oregon law.
Section 14: Right to Perform Franchise Fee Audit or Review; Default. In addition to all rights granted under
Section 13, the City shall have the right to have performed, a formal audit or a professional review of the Franchisee's books and
records by an independent private auditor, for the sole purpose of determining the Gross Receipts of the Franchisee generated through
the provision of telecommunications services under this Franchise and the accuracy of amounts paid as Franchise fees to the City by
the Franchisee; provided, however, that any audit or review must be commenced not later than three (3) years after the date on which
franchise fees for any period being audited or reviewed were due. The cost of any such audit or review shall be borne by the City,
except that if it is established that the Franchisee has made underpayment of 2% or more of the total Franchise fees due during the year
or years subject to the audit required by this Franchise, then the Franchisee shall, within 30 days of being requested to do so by the
City, reimburse the City for the full cost of the audit or review. The City agrees to protect from disclosure to third parties, to the
maximum extent allowed by Oregon law, any information obtained as a result of its rights pursuant to this Section, or any compilation
or other derivative works created using information obtained pursuant to the exercise of its rights hereunder. If such formal audit or a
professional review of the Franchisee's books and records indicates that there has been a transfer of revenues from the Franchisee to
any other entity such that such amounts that should have been calculated as part of the franchise fee have not been so calculate and
have not been previously paid or have not been paid within 90 days after written notice of the City to the Franchisee, then an event of
default under the agreement shall have occurred.
Section 15: Right to Inspect Construction. The City or its representatives shall have the right to inspect all construction or
installation work performed pursuant to this Franchise and to make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with the
8/10/2020 3702.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11341 5/7
terms of this Franchise and other pertinent provisions of law relating to management of the City’s rights-of-way.
Section 16: Right to Require Removal of Property. At the expiration of the Initial Term for which the Franchise is
granted, or the last renewal thereof, or upon forfeiture or revocation as provided for herein, the City shall have the right to require the
Franchisee to remove, at Franchisee's own expense, all or any part of the telecommunications system from rights-of-way within the
Franchise area. If the Franchisee fails to do so within one hundred and eighty (180) days after receipt of notice from the City, the City
may perform the work and collect the cost thereof from the Franchisee. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, the
Franchisee, by written notice to the City, may elect to abandon underground cable in place, in which event the Franchisee shall have no
further obligation hereunder as to the abandoned cable; except that the City may nevertheless, by written notice, require the Franchisee
to remove cable, at Franchisee’s own expense, as deemed necessary by the City to provide space for other authorized uses or to
accomplish or enable the accomplishment of other public purposes.
Section 17: Limited Waiver of Sovereign Immunity; Venue.
A. The City may have sovereign or other immunities which might prevent or impair enforcement or enjoyment of the
terms of this Franchise. Without making a general waiver, limitation or modification of such sovereign or other immunity, the City
hereby expressly grants, in favor of Franchisee, a limited, non-assignable waiver of its immunities for claims arising under this
Franchise, it being the intent of the parties that the waivers herein provided shall result in the terms and conditions of this franchise
being enforced in a competitively neutral manner.
B. Venue for any proceeding brought to enforce any term or condition of this Franchise shall be the Circuit Court for
Umatilla County, Oregon; provided, however, that should any proceeding be brought in a federal forum, such proceeding shall be
brought in the U.S. District Court of Oregon in Portland, Oregon, with the parties stipulating to trial in Pendleton, Oregon.
C. Notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations or other law, these limited waivers of sovereign immunity shall
expire when all obligations under this Franchise have been fully and completely performed, or the passage of twenty-four months from
the termination of this Franchise, whichever is later.
Section 18: Limitation of Liability. The City and the Franchisee agree that neither shall be liable to the other for any
indirect, special, or consequential damages, or any lost profits, arising out of any provision or requirement contained herein, or, in the
event this Franchise, or any part hereof, is determined or declared to be invalid.
Section 19: Compliance With Applicable Laws. Franchisee shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws,
ordinances, and regulations, whether now in existence or hereinafter enacted. Nothing contained in this Franchise shall be construed as
authorizing the Franchisee, its officers, employees or agents, to violate any federal, state or local law, whether now in existence or
hereinafter enacted, including, by way of illustration but not of limitation, any provision of Oregon anti-trust law, ORS 646.750-
646.836, or the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act, ORS 646.650-646.652. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as
requiring Franchisee to comply with any federal, state or local law that is repealed or otherwise rendered unenforceable subsequent to
the adoption of this Franchise.
Section 20: Revocation.
A. General. In addition to any rights set out elsewhere in this document, the City reserves the right to declare a
forfeiture or otherwise revoke this Franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, under the following circumstances:
(1) Following a hearing as provided herein, the Franchisee is determined to be in violation of any material
provision of this Franchise and fails to correct the violation after written notice of the violation, proposed forfeiture and reasonable
opportunity thereafter to cure;
(2) The Franchisee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged bankrupt;
(3) The Franchisee is found to have engaged in fraud or deceit upon the City or any other persons;
(4) The Franchisee fails to obtain and maintain any permit required by any federal or state regulatory body for
the construction, maintenance and operation of its telecommunications system; provided, however, that the Franchisee shall be allowed
a reasonable time to cure failure to obtain any permit, and that such permit is material to the operation of Franchisee’s
telecommunications system or the City’s management of its rights-of-way; or
(5) The Franchisee fails to maintain the full amount of its insurance as required under the terms of this
Franchise.
Upon the occurrence of one of the events set out above, and following not less than 30 days written notice, the City shall conduct a
hearing upon the proposed forfeiture. The Franchisee shall be afforded due process rights as if the hearing were a contested case
hearing subject to ORS Chapter 183, including the right to present evidence, to subpoena and cross-examine witnesses, to subpoena

documents, and to require that all testimony be on the record. Findings from the hearing shall be written and shall stipulate the reasons
for the City's decision. If the City finds that the Franchise should be forfeited, the City shall by ordinance declare a forfeiture of the
Franchise. In the event that the Franchisee believes that the City has improperly declared a forfeiture, the Franchisee may file such
proceeding as is appropriate in a court of competent jurisdiction to determine whether the City has properly declared a forfeiture. If a
forfeiture is lawfully declared by a court of competent jurisdiction, all rights of the Franchisee shall immediately be divested without a
further act upon the part of the City.
B. Receivership. In addition to its other rights and remedies as set forth in this Franchise, the City shall have the right,
subject to federal law, to declare a forfeiture of this Franchise one hundred and twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or
trustee to take over and conduct the Franchisee's business, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other similar action
or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred and twenty
(120) days, or unless: a) within one hundred and twenty (120) days after such appointment, the receiver or trustee shall have fully
complied with all provisions of this Franchise and remedied any and all violations or defaults, as approved by a City Council
resolution; and b) within said one hundred and twenty (120) days, such receiver or trustee shall have executed an agreement with the
City, duly approved by the City and the court having competent jurisdiction, in which such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be
bound by each and every provision of this Franchise.

Section 23: Severability. The provisions of this Franchise are severable; if any section, subsection, sentence or clause shall be
found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unconstitutional, or is clearly and specifically preempted by federal or state

or limit any of its rights under this Franchise by reason of such failure or neglect.
B. No provision of this Franchise will be deemed waived unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party
waiving its rights. However, if Franchisee gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure or comply with a provision of this
Franchise, and the City fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, such provision shall be deemed waived.

Enacted: 8/17/2004; last amended: 7/5/16.
Whereas, the City of Pendleton has an air quality problem, par_ally caused by the use of uncer_fied wood stoves and
inserts, and

(Sec_on added by Ordinance No. 3895, passed 7/5/16.)
Whereas, the City of Pendleton wishes to help resolve this air quality problem by encouraging the replacement of these
uncer_fied stoves and uncer_fied wood stove inserts by making loans to our ci_zens and to those property owners
located within an approximate 3-mile radius of city limits, to purchase replacement hea_ng systems and allowing them to
pay back the loan over _me, and to protect these funds by allowing the property owner to place a lien on their property.

ORDINANCE NO. 3712
AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING A PROCESS FOR
CONSIDERING CLAIMS FOR DIMINISHED PROPERTY
VALUE (As amended by Ordinance No. 3934)
Enacted December 20, 2004; last amended March 5, 2019.
Whereas, On November 2, 2004, the voters of the State of Oregon approved Ballot Measure 37 that
amended Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 197 to require governments pay compensation to present
owners of real property if land use regulations restrict the use of the property such that it reduces its
fair market value or, in the alternative, forego enforcement of the regulation (waiver) which restricts
the use beyond those restrictions in place on the property at the time the owner acquired the property;
and
Whereas, Ballot Measure 37 provides that in order to receive compensation or waiver of a land use
regulation, a present owner of real property (claimant) must make a written “demand for
compensation” (claim) to the government entity enacting or enforcing a land use regulation that
allegedly restricts the use of their property in this manner; and
Whereas, Ballot Measure 37 authorizes the city to adopt and apply procedures for processing
compensation claims; and
Whereas, It is in the interest of the citizens of the City of Pendleton to adopt such procedures to
ensure fair and timely review of claims and to protect the public from the detrimental effects to the
public health, safety, and welfare that would result from the granting of non-meritorious claims; and
Whereas, The city wishes to do this by providing a process for the orderly review of claims;
establishing a minimum amount of factual and analytical information a claimant must provide in order
to file a claim; defining key terms and clarifying ambiguities in the text of the ballot measure; and
establishing a fee to offset part of the cost to the general public of evaluating claims; and
Whereas, Waiver or modification of land use regulations may negatively impact the fair market value
of neighboring properties. It is in the public interest that the city provide notice of claims to these
citizens and provide an avenue for protecting their reasonable investment-backed expectations where
they have relied upon land use regulations in purchasing real property by allowing them to seek to
recover from the claimant the amount of their damages through “Private Right of Action” in circuit
court;
Now, therefore,
The City of Pendleton Ordains as Follows:
SECTION 1. Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to implement Oregon Revised Statutes
Chapter 197, as amended by Ballot Measure 37, passed November 2, 2004, and to:
establish a procedure to process demands for compensation (claims) quickly, openly,
thoroughly, and consistent with the law;
8/10/2020 3712.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11340 2/7
enable present real property owners (claimants) making claims to have an adequate and fair
opportunity to present their claims to the City;
provide the City with the factual and analytical information necessary to adequately and
fairly consider claims;
ascertain city liability for compensation apart from State of Oregon (state) or Umatilla
County liability;
1

WRITTEN DEMAND FOR COMPENSATION. “Claim” or “demand” as defined herein.
SECTION 3. Applicability and Exceptions.

claim under this Ordinance if city enacts or enforces a new land use regulation or enforces a land use
regulation enacted prior to December 2, 2004, the effective date of Ballot Measure 37, and it restricts
the use of private real property, or any interest therein, and has the effect of reducing the fair market
value of the property, or any interest therein.
B. This Ordinance, in compliance with ORS Chapter 197, as amended by Ballot Measure
37, does not allow claims for certain categories of regulations which may reduce the fair market value
of the property, or any interest therein. The categories of regulations that are exempt from claims for
compensation include the following:

recognized as public nuisances under common law and the criminal laws of Oregon and The City of
Pendleton;

health and safety, such as fire and building codes, health and sanitation regulations, solid or hazardous
waste regulations, and pollution control regulations;

use of a property and has the effect of reducing the fair market value of the property.

and has the effect of reducing the fair market value of the property, all claims regarding that property
must be filed simultaneously and considered by the city simultaneously.

E. Claims based on regulations that contain discretionary criteria for approval of
development on a property may only be filed after the City of Pendleton has enforced its regulations
through approval or denial of a land use application. Such an approval or denial is necessary to
establish whether a particular land use regulation “restricts the use” of a property.

8/10/2020 3712.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11340 7/7

or not fully paid within 180 days of the date of filing a completed demand, the owner’s reasonable
attorney fees and expenses necessary to collect compensation will be added as additional
compensation provided compensation is awarded to the owner. If such demand is denied, not fully
paid, or other action taken under Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 197, within 180 days of the date of
filing a completed demand, and the owner commences suit or action to collect compensation, if city is
the prevailing party in such action, then city shall be entitled to any sum which a court, including any
appellate court, may adjudge reasonable as attorney’s fees.

cause of action in state circuit court to recover from the claimant the amount of the reduction, and
shall also be entitled to attorney’s fees.
SECTION 12. Applicable State Law.
For all demands filed, the applicable state laws are those portions of Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter
197 added or made a part of said Chapter by Ballot Measure 37, passed on November 2, 2004
amended, modified or clarified by subsequent amendments or regulations adopted by the Oregon State
Legislature, Oregon State Administrative Agencies or this Ordinance. Any demand that has not been
processed completely under this Ordinance shall be subject to any such amendments, modifications,

created using information obtained pursuant to the exercise of its rights hereunder.

from the Franchisee to any other entity such that such amounts that should have been calculated as part of the franchise fee have not
been so calculate and have not been previously paid or have not been paid within 90 days after written notice of the City to the
Franchisee, then an event of default under the agreement shall have occurred.
SECTION 15: Right to Inspect Construction. The City or its representatives shall have the right to inspect all construction or
installation work performed pursuant to this Franchise and to make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with the

export certificate, waive the filing of the certificate.

evidence of the exportation of the motor vehicle fuel to which it applies only if accepted by the dealer in good faith.

prescribe and require, the source of supply of all fuels purchased or used, and the particular vehicles or equipment in which used.

Whereas, Historically, there has been no formal document that has enumerated the duties and responsibilities of the Pendleton Police

traditions. This lack of documentation has become an issue during the accreditation process for the Pendleton Police Department; and
Whereas, The City Council finds that, in order to ensure the successful completion of the accreditation process and the benefits that
will accrue to the City through accreditation, it is appropriate to formally establish the existence of the Pendleton Police Department
and to enumerate the authority and responsibilities of the Chief of Police and the officers assigned to the Department.
Now, Therefore,
THE CITY OF PENDLETON ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. Purpose.
The City of Pendleton shall maintain a Police Department as defined in ORS 181.610 (8)(a) for the purpose preventing crime,

of Pendleton, preserving the peace, protecting lives and property, and performing community caretaking functions as defined in ORS
133.033.
Section 2. Organization.
The Police Department shall consist of such members, sworn and non-sworn, paid and volunteer, as the Chief of Police

Manager or City Council. Sworn members of the Department shall have all of the authorities granted to them and defined by law
pursuant to ORS 181.610 (8)(a)(11) and ORS 133.005 (3). In every instance, sworn members of the Department, including paid
members and volunteers, shall subscribe to an oath of office.
Section 3. Chief of Police, Position Created and Appointment.
There is created the position of Chief of Police pursuant to Section 10 of the Pendleton City Charter and such Chief of Police
shall be appointed by the City Manager.
Section 4. Powers and Duties Generally.
The powers and duties of the Chief of Police shall generally be as follows:
(A) Establish departmental objectives in line with City Council goals. Plan and develop law enforcement policies,
procedures, standards and programs based on an analysis of city growth, crime patterns, workload, staffing levels and related
economic, legislative and judicial influences to provide appropriate and effective law enforcement services to the community.
(B) Have authority and responsibility for the fiscal management of the Department, including developing justification for
and presentation of department budget requests; Manage and monitor approved department budgets; Prepare or review department
requests for proposals; and review and approve department expenditures
(C) Assign, supervise and evaluate the work of subordinates; Hear grievances from and administer disciplinary action to
department personnel; Interview and effectively recommend department hiring and termination actions; Ensure provision of adequate
training within the Department.
(D) Supervise and assist in major departmental problems, crimes or accidents and perform such additional duties as may be
assigned by the City Manager.

ORDINANCE NO. 3791
AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING NATIONAL FLOOD NSURANCE
PROGRAM FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAPS FOR PENDLETON AND
ENACTING REGULATIONS CONSISTENT THEREWITH
Whereas, The residents of Pendleton have established The City of Pendleton to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its residents; and
Whereas, Flood hazard areas of the City of Pendleton and those lands within its Urban Growth
Boundary are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and
Whereas, These flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas, which are inadequately
elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect
of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
Whereas, The City of Pendleton has the primary responsibility for planning, adoption and
enforcement of land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain management.
Whereas, It is appropriate to adopt this Ordinance to:
l . Protect human life, health and property;

b. Issue a variance to this ordinance in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.0
(Variance Procedures) herein; or
c. Order the owner of the property upon which the violation exists to provide whatever
additional information may be required for their determination. Such information must be
provided to the Planning Commission within 28 days of such order, and he shall submit an
amended report to the Floodplain board with 21 days. At their next regularly scheduled
public meeting, the Planning Commission shall either order the abatement of said violation
or they shall grant a variance in accordance with the provisions of Section VI (Variance and
Appeal Procedures) herein.
3. If a Variance cannot be granted according to Section VI, submit to the Administrator of Federal
Insurance Administration a declaration for denial of insurance, stating that the property is in
violation of a cited statute or local law, regulation or ordinance, pursuant to section 1316 of the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 as amended.
Part V VARIANCE AND APPEAL PROCEDURES
Section 51 Variance
1. An application for a variance shall be processed according to the standards and criteria for
approval of a variance contained herein and in Article XX of the City of Pendleton Zoning
Ordinance (No. 3250, as amended).
2. In addition to the criteria that must be satisfied for a standard variance, the Planning
Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in
other sections of this ordinance, and the:
a. danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b. danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c. susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner;
d. importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e. necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
f. availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding
or erosion damage;
g. compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
8/10/2020 3791
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=57573 14/17
h. relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management
program for that area;
i. safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j. expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and,
k. costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems, and streets and bridges.
3. Upon consideration of the factors of Section 4.4-1(4) and the purposes of this ordinance, the
Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Pendleton and to further the
purposes of this ordinance.
4. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a permanent record of all variances and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.[73]
Section 52. Criteria for Variances
1. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.[74]
2. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued
is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the
base flood level, providing items Section 51 (2) of this Ordinance have been fully considered.
As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.[75]
3. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. [76]
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a:
a. showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and;
c. determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section 4. I -4(4), or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.[77]
5. Variances may be issued for a water dependent use provided that the
a. criteria of paragraphs (a)(l) through (a)(4) of this section are met, and;
b. structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. [78]
6. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed
on the National Register of Historic Places or the Statewide Inventory of Historic Properties,
without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.[79]
7. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the
general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece or property; they are not
personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial
circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential
neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare. [80]
8. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a
lesser of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofmg, where it can be determined that
such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria and
otherwise complies with building codes.[81]
Section 53. Variance Decision
The decision to either grant or deny a variance shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for
such approval and denial. If the variance is granted, the property owner shall be put on notice along
with the written decision that the permitted building will have its lowest floor below the base flood
elevation and that the cost of flood insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased flood
damage risk. [82]
Section 54. Appeals

the facts, technical information and the legal basis for the decision.
Section 56. Appeals from the Planning Commission. Decision of the Planning Commission
pursuant to this Ordinance may be appealed to the City Council if the property is within the city
limits or the Board of County Commissioners if outside the city limits within 21 days after the
Planning Commission has mailed its decision.
The applicant who initiated the action before the Planning Commission or any persons who
appeared before the Planning Commission orally or in writing may appeal the decision of the
Planning Commission. Written notice of the appeal shall be filed with the Floodplain Administrator.
If an appeal is filed, the City Council or Board of County Commissioners shall receive a copy of the
Planning Commission decision and shall hold a public hearing on the appeal and shall review the
matter de novo.
Part VI. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION
Section 61. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered unless in
full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
Section 62. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with any of its
requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants
of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined
not more than $1000.00. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Pendleton from taking such other lawful actions
as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
Part VII.
Section 71. This ordinance is severable. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared invalid by
a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect
and shall be read to carry out the purpose(s) of the ordinance before the declaration of partial
invalidity.
Section 72. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another ordinance, building
codes, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.

outside the floodplain.
Placement of equipment in the floodway should be restricted to only that equipment which is absolutely necessary for
the purposes of the project. All other accessory equipment and temporary structures (i.e. construction trailers) should
be restricted from the floodway.
Structures should be placed on site so that flood damages are minimized. The community may want to consider such
things as anchoring construction trailers in case evacuation isn't practical.
The following conditions should be included in the permit:
• Identification of the temporary changes to the floodplain under a I% chance flood event (100-year flood)
• Identification of all insurable structures affected by any increase in BFE during a 1% chance flood event (100-year flood)
• Written notification to the applicant that they may be liable for any flood damages resulting from the temporary structure
• The length of time the structure or encroachment will be allowed.
[68] No CLOMR/LOMR will be required because there is no need to modify the FIRM due to the temporary condition of the
encroachment, but the community should disclose to all owners of insurable structures and all applicants for permits in the
affected area that there is an increased risk of flooding for the duration of the temporary encroachment.

3.5 SIDEWALK ZONES
Allsidewalksalongthe Court Avenue frontageshallconformto the Standardsestablishedin the S.H.O.P. modelbelow.
Under appropriatecircumstances,the individualZones may be interchangeablep,rovidedminimum pedestrianaccess
standardsare maintained.The Cityreserves the rightto requirereconfiguration of sidewalkamenitiesif they encroachthe
pedestrianclear zone (HallwayZone) or resultin unnecessary obstaclesto disabledaccess. The ByersAvenue frontage
betweenMainStreetandSW 15‘Street may beconsideredfor alternativestandardsif/whenthe site redevelops.
THE S.H.O.P. MODEL:
(Developedbyandusedwiththe permissionof the Cityof Rockville,MD)
S.H.O.P. stands for StorefrontZone, HallwayZone, Outside
Zone, andParking/PedestrianZone. Thesefour zones serve as
the foundation for great retail streets wherepeoplego to be
“somewhere”rather thanjust goingto buysomething.
1. StorefronZtone — Designedto “maximizethe exposure
to the merchandiseperpendicularto the flow of
pedestriantraffic”andto create ‘friction’(interest)along
the storefront by extendingthe merchandiseexperience
beyondthe storefront.” In the Town Squarethis area
was referredto as the 2-foot widestorefront expansion
zone. In many cities,restaurants may “spillout” onto the
sidewalkin the Storefront Zone. Dependingon the
nature of the merchant,thereis the optionto expandthe
building(astoop, baywindow,etc.)into this area.
2. Hallway Zone —- The portion of the sidewalkreserved
for pedestriancirculation.The Hallwayzone shallmeet
ADA standards at a minimum, but shall strive for
additionalarea in orderto encourage comfortabletravel
(includingpassing)for users of all ages and abilities.
Cafes or property line issues should not force the
circulationtoo farfromthe storefront.
3. Outside Zone A The area betweenthewalkwayand the
street curb, whichfunctions as an ‘outdoor’room. This
‘room’ should feature urban amenities such as cafes,
kiosls, bicycleracks, benches, planters,and fountains.
Trees, however,are the most importantelementrequired
hereto providea sense of enclosure,and makethe space
feel likea room. Often the widthof the tree pit or tree
lawncontrolsthe width of the outsidezone. As a result,
the effective outside zone will vary along a street’s
length.
4. Parking/Pedestrian Zone — Offers a safe barrier
betweenmovingtraffic and the meanderingpedestrian,
includinga space wherevehicledoors may be opened
and occupants may enter or exit withoutunreasonable
obstruction.
NOTE:
The individualzones withinthismodelmay be interchangedas localconditionsallow,providedADA—compliaancctess is
maintainedanda minimumtwo (2)foot “door zone” is observedbetweenthe curbandany feature.

buildings with their own base, “roofline,” and
pattern of window and door openings.They are
commonlyequippedwith cantileveredshed roof(s)
or awning(s)to provideprotection from sun and
rain. Storefronts may not necessarilyserve retail
purposes for theirentire life,but should be designed
to be conduciveto retailactivity.The absenceof a
raised groundfloor generallyprecludesresidential
use on the groundfloor facingthe street; residential
uses are more appropriateabove the groundfloor
andbehindanother use that frontsthe street.

SIGNAGESTANDARDS
This Plan recognizesthe important function of signs and the
need to safeguardand enhance the economic and aesthetic
valuesin the City. Regulationof such factors as size, number,
location, illumination,construction,and maintenanceof signsis
intended to safeguardthe public health, safety and general
welfare.Sign regulationswithhighstandardshelp maintain the .
economic vitalityof the communityby ensuring aesthetically
appropriatedesignfor commercial advertisingthat is secondary iv
to the buildingor site on whichit is placedand complements
architecture,ratherthanoverpoweringor hidingit.
Signageplacedat a perpendicularangleto pedestrianandvehicle
traffic doesnot needto be excessivelylargeto attract attention.
Large signs placed on the buildingwall detract from the
architectureand characterof buildingsand do not contributeto
the pedestrianscaleof the neighborhood.
Desirable
Signageon the Court/ByersAvenue frontageshallbe permitted
equalto one square foot per foot of linear frontagealongSW
Court or ByersAvenue.
Signage shall be permitted along internal (north-south,
numbered) streets equalto one square foot per foot of linear
frontagealongthat street.
Signageon the RiverWalk frontageshallbe permittedequalto

termination or expiration of the Franchise or subsequent franchises, Grantee shall, within one hundred and eighty days,
remove all its facilities from the City’s rights-of-way. During such period, Grantee shall remit to the City any payments due
under this Franchise, as if this Franchise were in full force and effect. Should the Grantee fail to remove its facilities within
such one hundred and eighty day period, the City may do so, and the Grantee shall immediately remit to the City the costs of
such removal.
Section 5: No Limitation of City Authority.
(a) Except as provided in Section 6 below, nothing in this Franchise shall in any way be construed or interpreted to prevent, or
in any way limit, the City from modifying or performing any work in its rights-of-way, or granting other franchises for use of
rights-of-way, or of adopting general ordinances regulating use of or activities in the rights-of-way, or of otherwise abrogating
or limiting any rights, privileges or property interest the City now has in its rights-of-way, whether now owned or hereinafter
acquired.
(b) In the event that any portion of the Franchisee’s infrastructure interferes with any present or future use the City desires to
make of its rights-of-way, Franchisee shall, upon request, and at its sole expense, promptly relocate such infrastructure, and
restore the area where such relocation occurs to as good a condition as existed before the work was undertaken, unless
otherwise directed by the City.
(c) Except as otherwise provided by law, and subject to Section 6 herein, nothing in this Franchise shall be construed to give
the Franchisee any credit or exemption from any nondiscriminatory, generally applicable business tax, or other tax now or
hereafter levied upon Franchisee’s taxable real or personal property, or against any permit fees or inspection fees required as a
condition of construction of any improvements upon Franchisee’s real property and imposed under a generally applicable
ordinance or resolution.
Section 6: Competitively Neutral Application. The City shall impose, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis,

pay all applicable fees. Such work shall be done only in accordance with plans or designs submitted to, and approved by, the
City, such plans (1) to be evaluated by the standards applied to the construction of other similar telecommunications systems
in the City, and (2) maintained by the City as confidential and exempt from public disclosure to the maximum extent allowed
by law. Such work shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all rules, regulations, or

owning or maintaining facilities which may be affected by the proposed excavation or construction.

emergency repairs. Franchisee shall give notice to the City’s Department of Public Works by telephone, electronic data
transmittal or other appropriate means as soon as is practicable after commencement of work performed under emergency
conditions. Franchisee shall make such repairs in compliance with applicable ordinances and regulations, and shall apply for
any necessary permits no later than the business day next following the discovery of the need for such repairs.

shall include contractual liability coverage for the indemnity provided under this contract, and naming the City, its
officials, officers, employees and agents as additional insureds with respect to Franchisee’s activities pursuant to this
Franchise; provided, however, that if at any time during the term of this Franchise the amounts herein provided are
less than those provided under the Oregon Tort Claims Act, or any successor statute, Franchisee will increase the
amounts of coverage to amounts not less than those provided under such Act or successor statute.
Section 9: Transfers and Change in Control.
(a) Transfer. This Franchise shall not be sold, leased, assigned or otherwise transferred, nor shall any of the rights or
privileges herein granted or authorized be leased, assigned, mortgaged, sold or transferred, either in whole or in part, nor shall
title hereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property herein, pass to or vest in any person, except the
Franchisee, either by act of the Franchisee or by operation of law, without the consent of the City, expressed in writing, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If the Franchisee wishes to transfer this Franchise, the Franchisee shall give City
written notice of the proposed transfer, and shall request consent of the transfer by the City.
Any transfer of ownership effected without the written consent of the City shall render this Franchise subject to revocation.
The City shall have 60 days to act upon any request for approval of a transfer. If
the City fails to render a final decision on the request within said 60 days, the request shall be deemed granted unless the

8/10/2020 3802.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11332 4/8
The Franchisee, upon any transfer as heretofore described, shall within sixty (60) days thereafter file with the City a certified
statement evidencing the transfer and an acknowledgment of the transferee that it agrees to be bound by the terms and
conditions contained in this Franchise.
The requirements of this section shall not be deemed to prohibit the use of the Franchisee's property as collateral for security
in financing the construction or acquisition of all or part of a telecommunications system of the Franchisee or any affiliate of
the Franchisee. However, the telecommunications system franchised hereunder, including portions thereof used as collateral,
shall at all times continue to be subject to the provisions of this Franchise.
(b) Change of Control. The requirements of this section shall not be deemed to prohibit sale of tangible assets of the
Franchisee in the ordinary conduct of the Franchisee's business without the consent of the City. The requirements of this
section shall not be deemed to prohibit, without the consent of the City, a transfer to a transferee whose primary business is
telecommunications system operation and having a majority of its beneficial ownership held by the Franchisee, a parent of the
Franchisee, or an affiliate, a majority of whose beneficial ownership is held by a parent of the Franchisee.
Section 10: Indemnification. Subject to the limitations of the Oregon Tort Claims Act, the Oregon Constitution and the Charter of
the City of Pendleton, Oregon, each party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other, and the other’s officials, officers, agents
and employees, against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, suits, proceedings, damages, costs, reasonable attorney’s fees or
liabilities (Claims) arising out of, pertaining to, or occurring through the exercise of, the rights and privileges retained by, granted to, or
exercised by that party pursuant to this Franchise. Each party shall give to the other notice in writing of any such Claims within twenty
(20) days of the date that party receives notice of any such Claims. Neither party shall settle, compromise or take any action
prejudicial to the other’s defense of or interest in such Claims without the express written consent of the other.
Section 11: Compensation.
(a) Franchise Fee. In consideration of permission to use the streets and rights-of-way of the City for the construction,
operation, and maintenance of a telecommunications system within the Franchise area and to defray the costs of Franchise
regulation, for the first 10 years of this Franchise, the Franchisee shall, in lieu of other payments and as service is available to
each location, provide to City during the term of this Franchise, “dark fiber” between City Hall and Fire Station 1, Fire Station
2, the City Shops at 1501 SE Byers, the Pendleton Convention Center, the Parks, Recreation and Cemetery Office on Tutuilla
Road, and the Pendleton Police Department. Each installation will occur within 90 days of when fiber is within 350 ft. of the
City facility and run to the outside of the identified facility. The city will be responsible to provide underground facility and
installation if an aerial drop is not acceptable to the City. After the first 10 years of this Franchise or extensions, the Franchisee
shall, in addition to “dark fiber” described above, pay to City during the term of this Franchise an amount equal to six percent
(6%) of the Franchisee’s Gross Revenues (“Franchise Fee”)
(b) Modification Resulting from Action by Law. Upon thirty days notice and in the event any law or valid rule or regulation
applicable to this Franchise limits the Franchise Fee below the amount provided herein, or as subsequently modified, the
Franchisee agrees to and shall pay the maximum permissible amount and, if such law or valid rule or regulation is later
repealed or amended to allow a higher permissible amount, then Franchisee shall pay the higher amount commencing from the
date of such repeal or amendment, up to the maximum allowable by law.
(c) Payment of Franchise Fees. Payments due under this provision shall be computed and paid quarterly for the preceding
quarter, as of March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, each quarterly payment due and payable no later than
forty-five (45) days after such dates. Not later than the date of each payment, the Franchisee shall file with the City a written
statement, in a form satisfactory to the
City and signed under penalty of perjury by an officer of the Franchisee, identifying in detail the amount of gross revenue
received by the Franchisee, the computation basis and method, for the quarter for which payment is made.
(d) Interest; No Accord. Late franchise fee payments will be subject to late fees calculated on the basis of nine percent (9%)
per annum of the amount past due. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as accord that the amount paid is in fact
the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim City may have for further or
8/10/2020 3802.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11332 5/8
additional sums payable under the provisions of this Franchise. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation
by City.
1
11-38 11-38
(e) The Franchise Fee includes all compensation for the use of the City’s right-of-way. Franchisee may offset against the
Franchise Fee the amount of any fee or charge paid to the City in connection with the Grantee’s use of the right-of-way
when the fee or charge is not imposed under a generally applicable ordinance or resolution. The Franchise Fee shall not
be deemed to be in lieu of or a waiver of any ad valorem property tax which the City may now or hereafter be entitled
to, or to participate in, or to levy upon the property of Franchisee.
(f) Quality of “Dark Fiber” – The Dark Fiber provided will be ITU Single Mode G.653, or better.
Section 12: Right to Inspect Records. In order to manage the Franchisee’s use of rights-of-way pursuant to this Franchise, and to
determine and verify the amount of compensation due to the City under this Franchise, the Franchisee shall provide, upon request, the
following information in such form as may be reasonably required by the City: maps of the Franchisee’s telecommunications system;
the amount collected by the Franchisee from users of Telecommunications Service provided by Franchisee via its Telecommunications
network; the character and extent of the Telecommunications Service rendered therefor to them; and any other related financial
information required for the exercise of any other lawful right of Franchisee under this Franchise. The information or a signed
statement verifying that no such information exists, along with any further directly related data which may be required by the City to
adequately understand the information, shall be furnished by the Franchisee to the City within thirty days of when the City provides
notice requesting such information, at the Franchisee's cost and expense. The City agrees that such information is confidential and that
the City will use such information only for the purpose of managing its rights-of-way, determining compliance with the terms of this
Franchise, and verifying the adequacy of Franchisee’s fee payments. The City further agrees to protect such information from
disclosure to third parties to the maximum extent allowed by Oregon law.
Section 13: Right to Perform Franchise Fee Audit or Review; Default. In addition to all rights granted under Section 13, the City
shall have the right to have performed, a formal audit or a professional review of the Franchisee's books and records by an independent
private auditor, for the sole purpose of determining the Gross Receipts of the Franchisee generated through the provision of
telecommunications services under this Franchise and the accuracy of amounts paid as Franchise fees to the City by the Franchisee;
provided, however, that any audit or review must be commenced not later than three (3) years after the date on which franchise fees for
any period being audited or reviewed were due. The cost of any such audit or review shall be borne by the City, except that if it is
established that the Franchisee has made underpayment of 2% or more of the total Franchise fees due during the year or years subject
to the audit required by this Franchise, then the Franchisee shall, within 30 days of being requested to do so by the City, reimburse the
City for the full cost of the audit or review. The City agrees to protect from disclosure to third parties, to the maximum extent allowed
by Oregon law, any information obtained as a result of its rights pursuant to this Section, or any compilation or other derivative works
created using information obtained pursuant to the exercise of its rights hereunder.
If such formal audit or a professional review of the Franchisee's books and records indicates that there has been a transfer of revenues
from the Franchisee to any other entity such that such amounts that should have been calculated as part of the franchise fee have not
been so calculated and have not been previously paid or have not been paid within 90 days after written notice of the City to the
Franchisee, then an event of default under the agreement shall have occurred.
Section 14: Right to Inspect Construction. The City or its representatives shall have the right to inspect all construction or
installation work performed pursuant to this Franchise and to make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with the
terms of this Franchise and other pertinent provisions of law relating to management of the City’s rights-of-way.
Section 15: Right to Require Removal of Property. At the expiration of the Initial Term for which the Franchise is granted, or the
last renewal thereof, or upon forfeiture or revocation as provided for herein, the City shall have the right to require the Franchisee to
remove, at Franchisee's own expense, all or any part of the telecommunications system from rights-of-way within the Franchise area.
If the Franchisee fails to do so within one hundred and eighty (180) days after receipt of notice from the City, the City may perform the
8/10/2020 3802.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11332 6/8
work and collect the cost thereof from the Franchisee. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, the Franchisee, by written
notice to the City, may elect to abandon underground cable in place, in which event the Franchisee shall have no further obligation
hereunder as to the abandoned cable; except that the City may nevertheless, by written notice, require the Franchisee to remove cable,
at Franchisee’s own expense, as deemed necessary by the City to provide space for other authorized uses or to accomplish or enable the
accomplishment of other public purposes.
Section 16: Limited Waiver of Sovereign Immunity; Venue.
(a) The City may have sovereign or other immunities which might prevent or impair enforcement or enjoyment of the terms
of this Franchise. Without making a general waiver, limitation or modification of such sovereign or other immunity, the City
hereby expressly grants, in favor of Franchisee, a limited, non-assignable waiver of its immunities for claims arising under
this Franchise, it being the intent of the parties that the waivers herein provided shall result in the terms and conditions of this
franchise being enforced in a competitively neutral manner.
(b) Venue for any proceeding brought to enforce any term or condition of this Franchise shall be the Circuit Court for
Umatilla County, Oregon; provided, however, that should any proceeding be brought in a federal forum, such proceeding shall
be brought in the U.S. District Court of Oregon in Portland, Oregon, with the parties stipulating to trial in Pendleton, Oregon.
(c) Notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations or other law, these limited waivers of sovereign immunity shall
expire when all obligations under this Franchise have been fully and completely performed, or the passage of twenty-four
months from the termination of this Franchise, whichever is later.
Section 17: Limitation of Liability. The City and the Franchisee agree that neither shall be liable to the other for any indirect,
special, or consequential damages, or any lost profits, arising out of any provision or requirement contained herein, or, in the event this
Franchise, or any part hereof, is determined or declared to be invalid.
Section 18: Compliance with Applicable Laws. Franchisee shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws,
ordinances, and regulations, whether now in existence or hereinafter enacted. Nothing contained in this Franchise shall be construed as
authorizing the Franchisee, its officers, employees or agents, to violate any federal, state or local law, whether now in existence or
hereinafter enacted, including, by way of illustration but not of limitation, any provision of Oregon anti-trust law, ORS 646.750-
646.836, or the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act, ORS 646.650-646.652. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as
requiring Franchisee to comply with any federal, state or local law that is repealed or otherwise rendered unenforceable subsequent to
the adoption of this Franchise.
Section 19: Revocation.
(a) General. In addition to any rights set out elsewhere in this document, the City reserves the right to declare a forfeiture or
otherwise revoke this Franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, under the following circumstances:
1
11-38 11-38
(1) Following a hearing as provided herein, the Franchisee is determined to be in violation of any material provision
of this Franchise and fails to correct the violation after written notice of the violation, proposed forfeiture and
reasonable opportunity thereafter to cure;
(2) The Franchisee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged bankrupt;
(3) The Franchisee is found to have engaged in fraud or deceit upon the City or any other persons;
(4) The Franchisee fails to obtain and maintain any permit required by any federal or state regulatory body for the

8/10/2020 3802.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11332 7/8
shall be allowed a reasonable time to cure failure to obtain any permit, and that such permit is material to the
operation of Franchisee’s telecommunications system or the City’s management of its rights-of-way; or
(5) The Franchisee fails to maintain the full amount of its insurance as required under the terms of this Franchise.
Upon the occurrence of one of the events set out above, and following not less than 30 days written notice, the City shall
conduct a hearing upon the proposed forfeiture. The Franchisee shall be afforded due process rights as if the hearing were a
contested case hearing subject to ORS Chapter 183, including the right to present evidence, to subpoena and cross-examine
witnesses, to subpoena documents, and to require that all testimony be on the record. Findings from the hearing shall be
written and shall stipulate the reasons for the City's decision. If the City finds that the Franchise should be forfeited, the City
shall by ordinance declare a forfeiture of the Franchise. In the event that the Franchisee believes that the City has improperly
declared a forfeiture, the Franchisee may file such proceeding as is appropriate in a court of competent jurisdiction to
determine whether the City has properly declared a forfeiture. If a forfeiture is lawfully declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction, all rights of the Franchisee shall immediately be divested without a further act upon the part of the City.
(b) Receivership. In addition to its other rights and remedies as set forth in this Franchise, the City shall have the right,
subject to federal law, to declare a forfeiture of this Franchise one hundred and twenty (120) days after the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the Franchisee's business, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or
other similar action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of
said one hundred and twenty (120) days, or unless: a) within one hundred and twenty (120) days after such appointment, the
receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all provisions of this Franchise and remedied any and all violations or
defaults, as approved by a City Council resolution; and b) within said one hundred and twenty (120) days, such receiver or
trustee shall have executed an agreement with the City, duly approved by the City and the court having competent jurisdiction,
in which such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this Franchise.
Section 20: Notice. Any notice provided for under this Franchise shall be sufficient if in writing and (1) delivered personally to the
other party or deposited in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, certified mail, return receipt requested; (2) sent overnight by commercial air
courier; or (3) sent by facsimile transmission, provided receipt of such facsimile is confirmed, in writing, on the first business day

or limit any of its rights under this Franchise by reason of such failure or neglect.
(b) No provision of this Franchise will be deemed waived unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party waiving its
rights. However, if Franchisee gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure or comply with a provision of this
Franchise, and the City fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, such provision shall be deemed
waived.

applicable to this Franchise limits the Franchise Fee below the amount provided herein, or as subsequently modified, the
Franchisee agrees to and shall pay the maximum permissible amount and, if such law or valid rule or regulation is later
repealed or amended to allow a higher permissible amount, then Franchisee shall pay the higher amount commencing from the
date of such repeal or amendment, up to the maximum allowable by law.

made.
(d) Interest; No Accord. Late franchise fee payments will be subject to late fees calculated on the basis of nine percent per
annum of the amount past due. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as accord that the amount paid is in fact the

additional sums payable under the provisions of this Franchise. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation
by City.
(e) The Franchise Fee includes all compensation for the use of the City’s right-of-way. Franchisee may offset against the
Franchise Fee the amount of any fee or charge paid to the City in connection with the Grantee’s use of the right-of-way

be deemed to be in lieu of or a waiver of any ad valorem property tax which the City may now or hereafter be entitled
to, or to participate in, or to levy upon the property of Franchisee.
Section 12 [Reserved]
Section 13: Right to Inspect Records. In order to manage the Franchisee’s use of rights-of-way pursuant to this Franchise, and to

following information in such form as may be reasonably required by the City: maps of the Franchisee’s telecommunications system;
the amount collected by the Franchisee from users of Telecommunications Service provided by Franchisee via its Telecommunications
network; the character and extent of the Telecommunications Service rendered therefore to them; and any other related financial
information required for the exercise of any other lawful right of Franchisee under this Franchise. The information or a signed
statement verifying that no such information exists, along with any further directly related data which may be required by the City to
8/10/2020 3811.doc
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11331 5/8
adequately understand the information, shall be furnished by the Franchisee to the City within thirty days of when the City provides
notice requesting such information, at the Franchisee's cost and expense. The City agrees that such information is confidential and that
the City will use such information only for the purpose of managing its rights-of-way, determining compliance with the terms of this
Franchise, and verifying the adequacy of Franchisee’s fee payments. The City further agrees to protect such information from
disclosure to third parties to the maximum extent allowed by Oregon law.
Section 14: Right to Perform Franchise Fee Audit or Review; Default. In addition to all rights granted under Section 13, the City
shall have the right to have performed, a formal audit or a professional review of the Franchisee's books and records by an independent
private auditor, for the sole purpose of determining the Gross Receipts of the Franchisee generated through the provision of
telecommunications services under this Franchise and the accuracy of amounts paid as Franchise fees to the City by the Franchisee;
provided, however, that any audit or review must be commenced not later than 3 years after the date on which franchise fees for any
period being audited or reviewed were due. The cost of any such audit or review shall be borne by the City, except that if it is
established that the Franchisee has made underpayment of 2% or more of the total Franchise fees due during the year or years subject
to the audit required by this Franchise, then the Franchisee shall, within 30 days of being requested to do so by the City, reimburse the
City for the full cost of the audit or review. The City agrees to protect from disclosure to third parties, to the maximum extent allowed
by Oregon law, any information obtained as a result of its rights pursuant to this Section, or any compilation or other derivative works
created using information obtained pursuant to the exercise of its rights hereunder.
If such formal audit or a professional review of the Franchisee's books and records indicates that there has been a transfer of revenues
from the Franchisee to any other entity such that such amounts that should have been calculated as part of the franchise fee have not
been so calculate and have not been previously paid or have not been paid within 90 days after written notice of the City to the
Franchisee, then an event of default under the agreement shall have occurred.
Section 15: Right to Inspect Construction. The City or its representatives shall have the right to inspect all construction or
installation work performed pursuant to this Franchise and to make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with the
terms of this Franchise and other pertinent provisions of law relating to management of the City’s rights-of-way.
Section 16: Right to Require Removal of Property. At the expiration of the Initial Term for which the Franchise is granted, or the
last renewal thereof, or upon forfeiture or revocation as provided for herein, the City shall have the right to require the Franchisee to
remove, at Franchisee's own expense, all or any part of the telecommunications system from rights-of-way within the Franchise area.
If the Franchisee fails to do so within one hundred and eighty (180) days after receipt of notice from the City, the City may perform the
work and collect the cost thereof from the Franchisee. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, the Franchisee, by written
notice to the City, may elect to abandon underground cable in place, in which event the Franchisee shall have no further obligation
hereunder as to the abandoned cable; except that the City may nevertheless, by written notice, require the Franchisee to remove cable,
at Franchisee’s own expense, as deemed necessary by the City to provide space for other authorized uses or to accomplish or enable the
accomplishment of other public purposes.
Section 17: Limited Waiver of Sovereign Immunity; Venue.
(a) The City may have sovereign or other immunities which might prevent or impair enforcement or enjoyment of the terms
of this Franchise. Without making a general waiver, limitation or modification of such sovereign or other immunity, the City
hereby expressly grants, in favor of Franchisee, a limited, non-assignable waiver of its immunities for claims arising under
this Franchise, it being the intent of the parties that the waivers herein provided shall result in the terms and conditions of this
franchise being enforced in a competitively neutral manner.
(b) Venue for any proceeding brought to enforce any term or condition of this Franchise shall be the Circuit Court for
Umatilla County, Oregon; provided, however, that should any proceeding be brought in a federal forum, such proceeding shall
be brought in the U.S. District Court of Oregon in Portland, Oregon, with the parties stipulating to trial in Pendleton, Oregon.
(c) Notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations or other law, these limited waivers of sovereign immunity shall
expire when all obligations under this Franchise have been fully and completely performed, or the passage of twenty-four
months from the termination of this Franchise, whichever is later.

Section 18: Limitation of Liability. The City and the Franchisee agree that neither shall be liable to the other for any indirect,
special, or consequential damages, or any lost profits, arising out of any provision or requirement contained herein, or, in the event this
Franchise, or any part hereof, is determined or declared to be invalid.
Section 19: Compliance With Applicable Laws. Franchisee shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws,
ordinances, and regulations, whether now in existence or hereinafter enacted. Nothing contained in this Franchise shall be construed as
authorizing the Franchisee, its officers, employees or agents, to violate any federal, state or local law, whether now in existence or
hereinafter enacted, including, by way of illustration but not of limitation, any provision of Oregon anti-trust law, ORS 646.750-
646.836, or the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act, ORS 646.650-646.652. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as
requiring Franchisee to comply with any federal, state or local law that is repealed or otherwise rendered unenforceable subsequent to
the adoption of this Franchise.
Section 20: Revocation.
(a) General. In addition to any rights set out elsewhere in this document, the City reserves the right to declare a forfeiture or
otherwise revoke this Franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, under the following circumstances:
(1) Following a hearing as provided herein, the Franchisee is determined to be in violation of any material provision
of this Franchise and fails to correct the violation after written notice of the violation, proposed forfeiture and
reasonable opportunity thereafter to cure;
(2) the Franchisee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged bankrupt;
(3) the Franchisee is found to have engaged in fraud or deceit upon the City or any other persons;
(4) the Franchisee fails to obtain and maintain any permit required by any federal or state regulatory body for the
construction, maintenance and operation of its telecommunications system; provided, however, that the Franchisee
shall be allowed a reasonable time to cure failure to obtain any permit, and that such permit is material to the
operation of Franchisee’s telecommunications system or the City’s management of its rights-of-way; or
(5) the Franchisee fails to maintain the full amount of its insurance as required under the terms of this Franchise.
Upon the occurrence of one of the events set out above, and following not less than 30 days written notice, the City shall
conduct a hearing upon the proposed forfeiture. The Franchisee shall be afforded due process rights as if the hearing were a
contested case hearing subject to ORS Chapter 183, including the right to present evidence, to subpoena and cross-examine
witnesses, to subpoena documents, and to require that all testimony be on the record. Findings from the hearing shall be
written and shall stipulate the reasons for the City's decision. If the City finds that the Franchise should be forfeited, the City
shall by ordinance declare a forfeiture of the Franchise. In the event that the Franchisee believes that the City has improperly
declared a forfeiture, the Franchisee may file such proceeding as is appropriate in a court of competent jurisdiction to
determine whether the City has properly declared a forfeiture. If a forfeiture is lawfully declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction, all rights of the Franchisee shall immediately be divested without a further act upon the part of the City.
(b) Receivership. In addition to its other rights and remedies as set forth in this Franchise, the City shall have the right,
subject to federal law, to declare a forfeiture of this Franchise one hundred and twenty (120) days after the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the Franchisee's business, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or
other similar action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of
said one hundred and twenty (120) days, or unless: a) within one hundred and twenty (120) days after such appointment, the
receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all provisions of this Franchise and remedied any and all violations or
defaults, as approved by a City Council resolution; and b) within said one hundred and twenty (120) days, such receiver or
trustee shall have executed an agreement with the City, duly approved by the City and the court having competent jurisdiction,
in which such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this Franchise.

or limit any of its rights under this Franchise by reason of such failure or neglect.
(b) No provision of this Franchise will be deemed waived unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party waiving its
rights. However, if Franchisee gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure or comply with a provision of this
Franchise, and the City fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, such provision shall be deemed
waived.
Section 25: Emergency. The City Council of the city of Pendleton finds the health, safety and welfare of the city of Pendleton City

(b) In the event that any portion of the Franchisee’s infrastructure interferes with any present or future use the City desires to
make of its rights-of-way, Franchisee shall, upon request, and at its sole expense, promptly relocate such infrastructure, and
restore the area where such relocation occurs to as good a condition as existed before the work was undertaken, unless
otherwise directed by the City.
(c) Except as otherwise provided by law, and subject to Section 6 herein, nothing in this Franchise shall be construed to give
the Franchisee any credit or exemption from any nondiscriminatory, generally applicable business tax, or other tax now or
hereafter levied upon Franchisee’s taxable real or personal property, or against any permit fees or inspection fees required as a
condition of construction of any improvements upon Franchisee’s real property and imposed under a generally applicable
ordinance or resolution.
Section 6: Competitively Neutral Application. The City shall impose, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, similar
terms and conditions upon other similarly situated providers of telecommunications services operating within the City. Any
requirement imposed on Franchisee that is determined not in compliance with this Section 6 shall be unenforceable against Franchisee.
Section 7: Construction, Maintenance and Repair of Infrastructure.
(a) Franchisee may make all needful excavations in any right-of-way for the purpose of placing, erecting, laying, maintaining
or repairing Franchisee’s infrastructure, and shall repair, renew and replace the same as reasonably possible to the condition
that existed prior to such excavation. Franchisee shall obtain all necessary permits for such excavation and construction, and
pay all applicable fees. Such work shall be done only in accordance with plans or designs submitted to, and approved by, the
City, such plans (1) to be evaluated by the standards applied to the construction of other similar telecommunications systems

https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11329 3/8
in the City, and (2) maintained by the City as confidential and exempt from public disclosure to the maximum extent allowed
by law. Such work shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all rules, regulations, or
ordinances which may, during the term of this Franchise, be adopted from time to time by the City, or any other authority
having jurisdiction over rights-of-way. Prior to commencing excavation or construction, Franchisee shall give appropriate
notice to other franchisees, licensees or permittees of the City owning or maintaining facilities which may be affected by the
proposed excavation or construction.
(b) In the event emergency repairs are necessary for Franchisee’s facilities, Franchisee may immediately initiate such
emergency repairs. Franchisee shall give notice to the City’s Department of Public Works by telephone, electronic data
transmittal or other appropriate means as soon as is practicable after commencement of work performed under emergency
conditions. Franchisee shall make such repairs in compliance with applicable ordinances and regulations, and shall apply for

insurance specified in this section.

a certificate of insurance executed by an authorized representative of the insurer or insurers, evidencing that Franchisee’s
insurance complies with this section.
(c) Notice of Cancellation, Reduction, or Material Change in Coverage. If insurance coverage is canceled, reduced or
materially changed, Franchisee shall, prior to the effective date of such cancellation, reduction or material change, obtain the

responsible, to the extent not caused by the City’s negligence or intentional misconduct, for the costs of any damage, liability,
or injury, which are not otherwise covered by insurance or because of a failure to comply with this section.
(d) Insurance Required. During the term of this contract, Franchisee shall maintain in force, at its own expense, the following
insurance:
(1) Workers’ compensation insurance for all subject workers in compliance with ORS 656.017;
(2) At all times Franchisee shall maintain general liability insurance in an amount not less than the City’s exposure
under the Oregon Tort Claims Act (ORS 30.260 et seq.) or under any liability limits promulgated by the Office of the
State Court Administrator pursuant to the Act. These amounts change annually (see ORS 30.272 and ORS 30.273).

each occurrence, and for damage to property, not less than $104,300 for any single claim and $521,400 for each
occurrence. This insurance coverage shall include contractual liability coverage for the indemnity provided under
this contract, and shall name the City, its officials, officers, employees and agents as additional insureds with respect
to Franchisee’s activities pursuant to this Franchise.
Section 9: Transfers and Change in Control.
(a) Transfer. This Franchise shall not be sold, leased, assigned or otherwise transferred, nor shall any of the rights or
privileges herein granted or authorized be leased, assigned, mortgaged, sold or transferred, either in whole or in part, nor shall
title hereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property herein, pass to or vest in any person, except the
Franchisee, either by act of the Franchisee or by operation of law, without the consent of the City, expressed in writing, such
8/10/2020 3828.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11329 4/8
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If the Franchisee wishes to transfer this Franchise, the Franchisee shall give City
written notice of the proposed transfer, and shall request consent of the transfer by the City.
Any transfer of ownership effected without the written consent of the City shall render such transfer void. The City shall have
60 days to act upon any request for approval of a transfer. If the City fails to render a final decision on the request within said
60 days, the request shall be deemed granted unless the Franchisee and the City agree to an extension of time.
The Franchisee, upon any transfer as heretofore described, shall within sixty (60) days thereafter file with the City a certified
statement evidencing the transfer and an acknowledgment of the transferee that it agrees to be bound by the terms and
conditions contained in this Franchise.
The requirements of this section shall not be deemed to prohibit the use of the Franchisee's property as collateral for security
in financing the construction or acquisition of all or part of a telecommunications system of the Franchisee or any affiliate of
the Franchisee. However, the telecommunications system franchised hereunder, including portions thereof used as collateral,
shall at all times continue to be subject to the provisions of this Franchise.
(b) Change of Control. The requirements of this section shall not be deemed to prohibit sale of tangible assets of the
Franchisee in the ordinary conduct of the Franchisee's business without the consent of the City. The requirements of this
section shall not be deemed to prohibit, without the consent of the City, a transfer to a transferee whose primary business is
telecommunications system operation and having a majority of its beneficial ownership held by the Franchisee, a parent of the
Franchisee, or an affiliate, a majority of whose beneficial ownership is held by a parent of the Franchisee.
Section 10: Indemnification. Subject to the limitations of the Oregon Tort Claims Act, the Oregon Constitution and the Charter of the
City of Pendleton, Oregon, each party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other, and the other’s officials, officers, agents
and employees, against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, suits, proceedings, damages, costs, reasonable attorney’s fees or
liabilities (Claims) arising out of, pertaining to, or occurring through the exercise of, the rights and privileges retained by, granted to, or
exercised by that party pursuant to this Franchise. Each party shall give to the other notice in writing of any such Claims within twenty
(20) days of the date that party receives notice of any such Claims. Neither party shall settle, compromise or take any action
prejudicial to the other’s defense of or interest in such Claims without the express written consent of the other.

11-40
Section 11: Compensation.
(a) Franchise Fee. The Franchisee shall pay to City during the term of this Franchise an amount equal to seven percent (7%)
of the Franchisee’s Gross Revenues (“Franchise Fee”).
(b) Modification Resulting from Action by Law. Upon thirty days’ notice and in the event any law or valid rule or regulation
applicable to this Franchise limits the Franchise Fee below the amount provided herein, or as subsequently modified, the
Franchisee agrees to and shall pay the maximum permissible amount and, if such law or valid rule or regulation is later
repealed or amended to allow a higher permissible amount, then Franchisee shall pay the higher amount commencing from the
date of such repeal or amendment, up to the maximum allowable by law.
(c) Payment of Franchise Fees. Payments due under this provision shall be computed and paid quarterly for the preceding
quarter, as of March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, each quarterly payment due and payable no later than
forty-five (45) days after such dates. Not later than the date of each payment, the Franchisee shall file with the City a written
statement, in a form satisfactory to the City and signed under penalty of perjury by an officer of the Franchisee, identifying in
detail the amount of gross revenue received by the Franchisee, the computation basis and method, for the quarter for which
payment is made.
(d) Interest; No Accord. Late franchise fee payments will be subject to late fees calculated on the basis of nine percent (9%)
per annum of the amount past due. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as accord that the amount paid is in fact
8/10/2020 3828.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11329 5/8
the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim City may have for further or
additional sums payable under the provisions of this Franchise. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation
by City.
(e) The Franchise Fee includes all compensation for the use of the City’s right-of-way. Franchisee may offset against the
Franchise Fee the amount of any fee or charge paid to the City in connection with the Grantee’s use of the right-of-way when
the fee or charge is not imposed under a generally applicable ordinance or resolution. The Franchise Fee shall not be deemed
to be in lieu of or a waiver of any ad valorem property tax which the City may now or hereafter be entitled to, or to participate
in, or to levy upon the property of Franchisee.
(f) In the event City and Franchisee enter into a separate mutual written agreement (a “Service Agreement”) under which
Franchisee will provide telecommunications or other services to the City, the parties agree that Franchisee may apply the Fair
Market Value (as defined herein) of such services against any Franchise Fee owed to the City by Franchisee. For purposes
hereof, Fair Market Value shall be determined by the parties at the time of execution of a Service Agreement; provided that, if
the parties fail to identify Fair Market Value, then Fair Market Values shall be Franchisee’s standard pricing for such services
in the Pendleton market.

11-40
Section 12: Right to Inspect Records. In order to manage the Franchisee’s use of rights-of-way pursuant to this Franchise, and to
determine and verify the amount of compensation due to the City under this Franchise, the Franchisee shall provide, upon request, the
following information in such form as may be reasonably required by the City: maps of the Franchisee’s telecommunications system;
the amount collected by the Franchisee from users of Telecommunications Service provided by Franchisee via its Telecommunications
network; the character and extent of the Telecommunications Service rendered therefor to them; and any other related financial
information required for the exercise of any other lawful right of Franchisee under this Franchise. The information or a signed
statement verifying that no such information exists, along with any further directly related data which may be required by the City to
adequately understand the information, shall be furnished by the Franchisee to the City within thirty days of when the City provides
notice requesting such information, at the Franchisee's cost and expense. The City agrees that such information is confidential and that
the City will use such information only for the purpose of managing its rights-of-way, determining compliance with the terms of this
Franchise, and verifying the adequacy of Franchisee’s fee payments. The City further agrees to protect such information from
disclosure to third parties to the maximum extent allowed by Oregon law.
Section 13: Right to Perform Franchise Fee Audit or Review; Default. In addition to all rights granted under Section 13, the City
shall have the right to have performed, a formal audit or a professional review of the Franchisee's books and records by an independent
private auditor, for the sole purpose of determining the Gross Receipts of the Franchisee generated through the provision of
telecommunications services under this Franchise and the accuracy of amounts paid as Franchise fees to the City by the Franchisee;
provided, however, that any audit or review must be commenced not later than three (3) years after the date on which franchise fees for
any period being audited or reviewed were due. The cost of any such audit or review shall be borne by the City, except that if it is
established that the Franchisee has made underpayment of 2% or more of the total Franchise fees due during the year or years subject
to the audit required by this Franchise, then the Franchisee shall, within 30 days of being requested to do so by the City, reimburse the
City for the full cost of the audit or review. The City agrees to protect from disclosure to third parties, to the maximum extent allowed
by Oregon law, any information obtained as a result of its rights pursuant to this Section, or any compilation or other derivative works
created using information obtained pursuant to the exercise of its rights hereunder.
If such formal audit or a professional review of the Franchisee's books and records indicates that there has been a transfer of revenues
from the Franchisee to any other entity such that such amounts that should have been calculated as part of the franchise fee have not
been so calculated and have not been previously paid or have not been paid within 90 days after written notice of the City to the
Franchisee, then an event of default under the agreement shall have occurred.
Section 14: Right to Inspect Construction. The City or its representatives shall have the right to inspect all construction or installation
work performed pursuant to this Franchise and to make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this
8/10/2020 3828.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11329 6/8
Franchise and other pertinent provisions of law relating to management of the City’s rights-of-way.

11-40
Section 15: Right to Require Removal of Property. At the expiration of the Initial Term for which the Franchise is granted, or the last
renewal thereof, or upon forfeiture or revocation as provided for herein, the City shall have the right to require the Franchisee to
remove, at Franchisee's own expense, all or any part of the telecommunications system from rights-of-way within the Franchise area.
If the Franchisee fails to do so within one hundred and eighty (180) days after receipt of notice from the City, the City may perform the
work and collect the cost thereof from the Franchisee. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, the Franchisee, by written
notice to the City, may elect to abandon underground cable in place, in which event the Franchisee shall have no further obligation
hereunder as to the abandoned cable; except that the City may nevertheless, by written notice, require the Franchisee to remove cable,
at Franchisee’s own expense, as deemed necessary by the City to provide space for other authorized uses or to accomplish or enable the
accomplishment of other public purposes.
Section 16: Limited Waiver of Sovereign Immunity; Venue.
(a) The City may have sovereign or other immunities which might prevent or impair enforcement or enjoyment of the terms
of this Franchise. Without making a general waiver, limitation or modification of such sovereign or other immunity, the City
hereby expressly grants, in favor of Franchisee, a limited, non-assignable waiver of its immunities for claims arising under
this Franchise, it being the intent of the parties that the waivers herein provided shall result in the terms and conditions of this
franchise being enforced in a competitively neutral manner.
(b) Venue for any proceeding brought to enforce any term or condition of this Franchise shall be the Circuit Court for
Umatilla County, Oregon; provided, however, that should any proceeding be brought in a federal forum, such proceeding shall
be brought in the U.S. District Court of Oregon in Portland, Oregon, with the parties stipulating to trial in Pendleton, Oregon.
(c) Notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations or other law, these limited waivers of sovereign immunity shall
expire when all obligations under this Franchise have been fully and completely performed, or the passage of twenty-four
months from the termination of this Franchise, whichever is later.
Section 17: Limitation of Liability. The City and the Franchisee agree that neither shall be liable to the other for any indirect, special,
or consequential damages, or any lost profits, arising out of any provision or requirement contained herein, or, in the event this
Franchise, or any part hereof, is determined or declared to be invalid.
Section 18: Compliance with Applicable Laws. Franchisee shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, ordinances,
and regulations, whether now in existence or hereinafter enacted. Nothing contained in this Franchise shall be construed as authorizing
the Franchisee, its officers, employees or agents, to violate any federal, state or local law, whether now in existence or hereinafter
enacted, including, by way of illustration but not of limitation, Ord. 2813, Ord. 3251, any provision of Oregon anti-trust law, ORS
646.705-646.836, or the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act, ORS 646.605-646.652. Nothing contained in this section shall be
construed as requiring Franchisee to comply with any federal, state or local law that is repealed or otherwise rendered unenforceable
subsequent to the adoption of this Franchise.

11-40
Section 19: Revocation.
(a) General. In addition to any rights set out elsewhere in this document, the City reserves the right to declare a forfeiture or
otherwise revoke this Franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, under the following circumstances:
(1) Following a hearing as provided herein, the Franchisee is determined to be in violation of any material provision
of this Franchise and fails to correct the violation after written notice of the violation, proposed forfeiture and
8/10/2020 3828.docx
https://cityofpendletonor.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/11319?preview=11329 7/8
reasonable opportunity thereafter to cure;
(2) The Franchisee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged bankrupt;
(3) The Franchisee is found to have engaged in fraud or deceit upon the City or any other persons;
(4) The Franchisee fails to obtain and maintain any permit required by any federal or state regulatory body for the
construction, maintenance and operation of its telecommunications system; provided, however, that the Franchisee
shall be allowed a reasonable time to cure failure to obtain any permit, and that such permit is material to the
operation of Franchisee’s telecommunications system or the City’s management of its rights-of-way; or
(5) The Franchisee fails to maintain the full amount of its insurance as required under the terms of this Franchise.
Upon the occurrence of one of the events set out above, and following not less than 30 days written notice, the City shall
conduct a hearing upon the proposed forfeiture. The Franchisee shall be afforded due process rights as if the hearing were a
contested case hearing subject to ORS Chapter 183, including the right to present evidence, to subpoena and cross-examine
witnesses, to subpoena documents, and to require that all testimony be on the record. Findings from the hearing shall be
written and shall stipulate the reasons for the City's decision. If the City finds that the Franchise should be forfeited, the City
shall by ordinance declare a forfeiture of the Franchise. In the event that the Franchisee believes that the City has improperly
declared a forfeiture, the Franchisee may file such proceeding as is appropriate in a court of competent jurisdiction to
determine whether the City has properly declared a forfeiture. If a forfeiture is lawfully declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction, all rights of the Franchisee shall immediately be divested without a further act upon the part of the City.

subject to federal law, to declare a forfeiture of this Franchise one hundred and twenty (120) days after the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the Franchisee's business, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or
other similar action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of
said one hundred and twenty (120) days, or unless: a) within one hundred and twenty (120) days after such appointment, the
receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all provisions of this Franchise and remedied any and all violations or
defaults, as approved by a City Council resolution; and b) within said one hundred and twenty (120) days, such receiver or
trustee shall have executed an agreement with the City, duly approved by the City and the court having competent jurisdiction,
in which such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this Franchise.

the fees paid to the Mayor and City Council; and
Whereas, Ordinance No. 3596 was adopted on January 5, 1999 setting the of fees paid to City Council
and Mayor; and
Whereas, by commission of a scrivener’s error, Ordinance No. 3808 neglected to repeal the prior
Ordinance, leaving two ordinances establishing the compensation of the City Council and Mayor; and
Whereas, It is appropriate to adopt a single ordinance establishing the fees paid to City Council and the
Mayor;
Now, therefore, THE CITY OF PENDLETON ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. Ordinance No. 3596 and Ordinance No. 3808 are hereby repealed; and

4.01.8 Mini-Storage / Self-Storage Requirements. Mini Storage/Self-Storage use has characteristics in common with
both commercial uses and industrial uses. In order to appropriately site mini storage/self-storage uses in commercial
zones, standards are necessary to maintain the desired character and function of the Central Mixed Use zone. In
general, Mini Storage/Self-Storage uses are similar to other commercial uses in that they provide a service to
residential and business uses. The character of their development is often more similar to industrial buildings and their
low activity level does not add to the vitality of a commercial area.
4.01.8.1 Other Uses. Other uses on the site such as the rental of trucks or moving equipment must meet the same
requirements of mini storage/self-storage.
4.01.8.2 Mini-Storage / Self-Storage Design Guidelines
A. Building and Roof Design. The building and roof are designed to be compatible with surrounding
development, especially nearby residential uses. Considerations include design elements that break up long,
monotonous building or roof lines and elements that are compatible with the desired character of the zone.
B. Building Materials. The materials used for buildings, roofs, fences and other structures are compatible with
the desired character of the neighborhood and are visually pleasing, especially near residential uses.
C. Street Facades. The design and layout of the street side of the site provides a varied and interesting façade.
Considerations include the use of setbacks, building placement, roof design, variation in building walls,
fencing, other structural elements, and landscaping.
D. Mini-Storage/Self-Storage Facilities and the Offices in conjunction with the units, on the same or adjoining
lot, must:
1. For those units visible from the frontage, access and/or abutting a residential use, have a façade that is:
a. Faux Stone Face
b. Stone Face
c. Brick Veneer
d. Brick
e. Hardiplank
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 25
f. Glass Unit Masonry
g. Tinted Smooth Finish Masonry Mud
h. A combination of the above
i. A combination of the above with the addition of staggered height parapet walls
2. Or an End Wall constructed with same façade
components as listed above. End wall must be of a length
that blocks from view the units along the frontage, access
and/or abutting a residential use.
3. All units of same size shall be painted the same color, a
color that is compatible with the façade of the office;
and/or all units shall be painted the same color, a color
that is compatible with the façade of the office.
4. Any new units added must be painted the same color as
the existing same-size units, a color that is compatible with
the façade of the office.
5. If the units are installed as separate cargo containers, a solid, continuous shell shall be constructed
around all the units or set of units and this shell shall be painted one color, a color that is compatible
with the façade of the office. This does not eliminate the use of accent colors for architectural
components designed to be a contrast but compatible
color to the main body of the structure.
E. Landscaping. The landscaping on the site provides
appropriate transition from public to private spaces,
separates and buffers the buildings from other uses especially
abutting residential uses, and provides visual relief from
stark, linear building walls.
1. A minimum of 40sqft of landscaping per required
parking space, which may include a combination of
hardscape, lawn, shrubbery and trees, shall be planted
around the office
2. A minimum of live vegetation equivalent to 4 feet by the length of End Wall, or those units
visible from the frontage, access, and/or abutting a residential use, around the End Wall or those units
visible from the frontage, access and/or abutting a residential use.
3. The planting of street trees adjacent to the public right-of-way shall be equivalent to one (1) tree per 50
linear feet. The street tree and any vegetation shall not create a vision hazard with adjacent traffic nor
the traffic both entering and exiting the mini-storage area.
4. All landscaping shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner.
5. All live vegetation shall remain alive for as long as this use occupies the site.
F. Fencing. Any proposed fencing is designed to be compatible with the desired character of the
neighborhood and is especially sensitive to abutting residential uses. Use of rolled razor wire or sightobscuring
material is not permitted.
1. Fencing shall not exceed the height permitted within Commercial zones.
2. Fencing material shall allow visibility within the facility to afford police opportunity to
observe inside the facility.
3. Fencing may require a building permit, dependent upon the height and/or material used.
4. Fencing must respect the Vision Clearance area; no fencing is allowed within this area.
G. Security. The perimeter of the site is designed to provide adequate security for both the site and abutting
sites. Considerations include fence and wall materials and placement, type and placement of landscaping
including thorny plant material and desired visibility or privacy.
H. Travel Lanes. Any travel lanes within the site shall be designed in a manner compatible with commercial
uses in commercial zones.
1. All travel lanes shall be paved to a minimum standard adequate for private roads.
2. (Reserved)
I. Signage. Signage shall be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood, with sensitivity to abutting
residential uses.
1. All signage shall comply with signs allowed within Sign District “A”, with no sign height exceeding 20
feet.
2. All lighted signage shall be subdued or turned off during the hours of darkness if a residential use is
within 200 feet of the mini storage/self-storage facility.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 26
J. Lighting. Lighting shall be designed to provide adequate security to the site without interference to the
surrounding neighborhood.
2. Lighting must project into the yard of the facility with
shielding to prevent light cascading into the surrounding
property. No lighting shall interrupt the living activities of
an abutting residential use.
3. Solar. The majority of mini-storage / self-storage facilities
are constructed with flat or semi-flat roofing, single-story
structures. These structures offer a large roof free of
appurtenances that make the installation of solar paneling
difficult. To encourage the use of such benefit, solar panel
installation is encouraged.

and property or occupants of land in its vicinity, that an obstruction may affect existing and future instrument
approach minimums at the Eastern Oregon Regional Airport at Pendleton; and that an obstruction may reduce
the size of the area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or
impair the utility of the Eastern Oregon Regional Airport at Pendleton and the public investment therein.
Accordingly, it is declared that:
A. The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is an injury to the region served by the Eastern Oregon
Regional Airport at Pendleton;
B. It is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or
establishment of airport hazards be prevented; and
C. The prevention of these hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of
the police power, without compensation. It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or
establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting
of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which the City may raise and expend public funds and
acquire land or interests in land.
5.06.2 Airport Zones. In order to carry out the provisions of this Article, there are hereby established and created
certain zones which include all of the land lying within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal zones,
and conical zones as they apply to the Airport. Such zones are shown on the Approach and Clear Zone Plan
adopted as part of the city’s Airport Master Plan and made a part of this Ordinance by reference. An area located
in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height
limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
A. Visual Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the
primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet
at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the
centerline of the runway.
B. Runway Larger Than Utility with a Visibility Minimum Greater Than: Mile Nonprecision Instrument
Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and
is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal
distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the
runway.
C. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the
width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands uniformly outward to a
width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the
continuation of the centerline of the runway.
D. Transitional Zones. These zones are hereby established as the area beneath the transitional surfaces. These
surfaces extend outward and upward at 90 degree angles to the runway centerline and the runaway centerline
extended at a slope of seven (7') feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and
approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 33
E. Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is hereby established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii from the
center of each end of the primary surface of each runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines
tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
F. Conical Zone. The conical zone is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the
horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone does
not include the visual approach zones and the transitional zones.
5.06.3 Airport Zone Height Limitations. No structure or vegetation shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be
maintained in any zone created by this Ordinance to a height in excess of the applicable height limitations herein
established for such zone as follows:
A. Visual Runway Approach Zone. Slopes upward twenty (20') feet horizontally for each foot vertically
beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal
distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
B. Runway Larger Than Utility with a Visibility Minimum Greater Than: Mile Nonprecision Instrument
Approach Zone. Slopes thirty-four (34') feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at
the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 20,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
C. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. Slopes fifty (50') feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal
distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes upward forty (40') feet
horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended
runway centerline.
D. Transitional Zones. Slopes upward and outward seven (7') feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning
at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach zones, and extending to a
height of 150 feet above the airport elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits
sloping upward seven (7') feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same
elevation as the approach zones, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface.
E. Horizontal Zone. One hundred and fifty (150') feet above the airport elevation.
F. Conical Zone. Slopes upward and outward twenty (20') feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at
the periphery of the horizontally zone and at one hundred fifty (150') feet above the airport elevation and
extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
5.06.4 Use Restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, no use shall be made of land or water
within any zone established by this Article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational
signals or radio communication between the Airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish
between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the Airport, impair visibility in the
vicinity of the Airport or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering
of aircraft intending to use the Airport.
5.06.5 Nonconforming Uses.
A. Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this Article shall not be construed to require the
removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or vegetation not conforming to these
regulations as of the effective date of this Ordinance, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming
use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or
intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which has begun prior to the effective date of
this Ordinance, and is diligently pursued to completion.
B. Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this Section, the owner of any existing
nonconforming structure or vegetative growth is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and
maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the City of Pendleton
indicating to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the Airport, the presence of such hazards. Such
markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the property owner.
5.06.6 Permits.
A. Future Uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or vegetation shall be
erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall
have been applied for and granted by the City Council, on recommendation of the Planning Commission.
1. However, a permit for vegetation or structures of less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground
shall not be required in the horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones
beyond a horizontal distance of 1,500 feet from each end of the runway except when such vegetation or
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 34
structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit
prescribed for the respective zone.
2. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient
evidence to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or vegetation would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit may be granted.
B. Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport
hazard or permit a non-conforming use, structure, or vegetation to become a greater hazard to air navigation
than it was on the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is when the
application for a permit is made.
C. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the City Manager determines that a
nonconforming structure or vegetation has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down,
physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or vegetation
to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the regulations herein.
D. Hazard Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to
effectuate the purpose of this Ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to
require the owner of the structure or vegetation in question, at his own expense, to install, operate, and
maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport
hazard.

Article VII. Overlay Zones
7.01 Opportunity Area Subdistrict (OA)
7.01.1 Description and Purpose. The Opportunity Area Subdistrict is intended to implement applicable
Comprehensive Plan Opportunity Area performance standards by:
A. Encouraging a range of housing types and densities ranging from work force to executive housing;
B. Providing greater flexibility in the development review process to respond to changing market conditions;
C. Providing incentives for better development design, provision of amenities, and creation of other public or
private facilities or open spaces;
D. Encouraging a diversity of compatible land uses and densities;
E. Providing a mechanism for the creative master planning of larger parcels of land within Opportunity Areas
rather than relying on traditional zoning to meet community objectives;
F. Encouraging the efficient and timely development of streets, utilities, open spaces and housing units; while
protecting designated natural and historical resources.
7.01.2 Applicability. The Opportunity Areas Subdistrict may be applied to land within Opportunity Areas designated
on the Pendleton Comprehensive Plan map at the request of the property owner(s).
A. There are two Mixed Use Opportunity Areas (MOAs) and three Residential Opportunity Areas (ROAs) each
of which has specific performance standards:
1. East Side MOA (285 gross acres near Hwy 11 Interchange)
2. Hospital MOA (94 gross acres near St. Anthony Hospital)
3. McKay Creek ROA (115 gross acres south of SW 28th Drive)
4. South Central ROA (251 gross acres south of Olney Cemetery)
5. Patawa Creek ROA (191 gross acres south of I-84 / west of SE 3rd St)
B. Property owners within a designated Opportunity Area have the choice of (a) developing under existing
zoning or (b) developing under the provisions of this Subdistrict.
C. Each Opportunity includes specific performance standards that must be addressed in proposed master
development plan.
7.01.3 Master Plan Required. To take advantage of the flexibility offered by the OA Subdistrict, the applicant must
submit a Master Development Plan (MDP) for review by the Planning Commission.
A. Once an MDP is approved for a specific area, it replaces existing zoning for that area.
B. The applicant (the property owner or authorized agent) shall be responsible for submitting an MDP that
meets the criteria and standards of this Section.
1. The MDP must be prepared by a planning professional (an architect, landscape architect, civil engineer
or land use planner) and shall:
a. Cover at least 20 gross acres;
b. Have the written consent of all property owners who will be subject to the MDP; and
c. Include all contiguous land under the ownership of the MDP applicant(s), within the OA
Subdistrict.
2. Where feasible, the MDP should cover the entire Opportunity Area. However, if some property owners
within the Opportunity Area are unwilling to be co-applicants for the MDP, the applicant(s) must
prepare a Facility Feasibility Plan (FFP) for the remainder of the Opportunity Area that is not part of
the MDP application.
3. The FFP must be prepared in consultation with the City Engineer and must show how:
a. Transportation, sewer, water and storm drainage facilities can feasibly be provided to the remainder
of the Opportunity Area that is not under the applicant’s control; and
b. Relevant Opportunity Area performance standards can reasonably be met in the future.
4. The applicant(s) must document a good faith effort to meet with, consider and accommodate the
comments of non-applicant property owners within the relevant Opportunity Area.
C. The Community Development Director may require special studies to ensure that identified slope, landslide,
flash flood or flood hazards are satisfactorily addressed.
D. In order for the MDP application to be deemed complete for purposes of Planning Commission review, it
must include the information required for Application Submittal and Completeness Review in Article 13 and
be specific enough to demonstrate that the Performance Standards of Section 7.01.4 are or can be met.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 40
7.01.4 Performance Standards. Land uses permitted outright or conditionally in any of the underlying zones
within the applicable Opportunity Area may be authorized by an approved MDP provided the Planning
Commission determines that all of the following performance standards are or can be met.
A. The MDP has been prepared by a planning professional and:
1. Covers at least 20 gross acres;
2. Includes all contiguous land under the ownership of the MDP applicant(s) within the OA Subdistrict;
and
3. Is consistent with the recommendations of any natural hazard studies required by the Community
Development Director.
B. The location of transportation, sanitary sewer, storm water and water facilities are consistent with the
Transportation System Plan and the Public Facilities Plan.
C. All public improvements are designed to meet City standards as determined by the City Engineer, unless
otherwise approved in the MDP by the Planning Commission.
D. The average density of residential development within the MDP ranges from 6 – 35 dwelling units per net
buildable acre. The minimum density standard does not apply to “constrained” lands as defined in Tech
Memo 3.1 (Winterbrook, 2012), public rights-of-way, or historic landmark properties.
E. The MDP and FFP must comply with all applicable subdistrict standards, including but not limited to the
Riparian Corridor and Wetland Subdistrict, the Flood Hazard Subdistrict, and the Historic Preservation
Subdistrict. Modification of subdistrict standards may only occur as prescribed in the applicable Subdistrict,
and is not permissible through the MDP process.
F. If required, the FFP has been prepared by a design professional in consultation with the City Engineer and
demonstrates that:
1. Transportation and public facilities can feasibly be provided to the remainder of the Opportunity Area
that is not under the applicant’s control; and
2. The performance standards of this Section can reasonably be met in the future for the remainder of the
Opportunity Area.
G. Where the requirements of this Ordinance or Oregon Transportation Planning Rule (OAR 660-012-0060)
thresholds are met, a Transportation Impact Study (TIS) shall be prepared based on land uses authorized by
the MDP.
H. To exceed the 18 units per buildable acre (the maximum allowed in the MDR district), density transfer is
permitted from inventoried natural features (wetlands, riparian corridors, flash flood zones, flood plains,
steep slopes, and high bedrock areas) to buildable land, provided that the natural feature is shown as open
space on the MDP.
I. No minimum lot size or internal setback requirements apply (other than those required by the Building Code
and public safety); however, the master plan must specify proposed lot size and other dimensional standards.
J. Street standards may be modified if approved by the Community Development Director and if determined
sufficient for safe access by the Fire Marshall.
K. The MDP must provide for graduated density at the perimeter of the site to ensure compatibility with
existing urban-level development; in particular, if urban-level single-family residential development abuts the
site, the MDP must show single family development along the common property line.
L. The MDP must arrange land uses and building heights to maintain views of surrounding hills from adjacent
properties.
M. The MDP must avoid garage-dominated homes by meeting the following standards:
1. The width of the street-facing garage cannot be greater than the width of the home;
2. Garages must be set back 20’ from property line to allow for parking; and
3. Parking is not allowed in front or side yards.
N. The MDP must provide for the long-term maintenance and funding of common open space.
7.01.5 Procedure. An application for MDP approval shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission under Type III
procedure in accordance with Article 13.
A. For the Planning Director to deem an MDP application complete for purposes of Planning Commission
review, all of the information required by Section 7.01.3 must be provided by the applicant(s).
B. The staff report to the Planning Commission must evaluate compliance with applicable review standards set
forth in Section 7.01.4, and identify the specific dimensional standards (for example, lot size, building height,
building setback, lot coverage, street width, housing density, etc.) that are proposed to be modified by the
MDP.
C. The Planning Commission shall approve, deny or approve with conditions the final decision approving the
MDP. The Planning Commission’s decision shall identify specifically the dimensional standards that are
modified in the MDP.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 41
D. An approved MDP within an Opportunity Area shall replace applicable zoning for that area. However,
existing dimensional and development standards shall apply to any future development proposal covered by
the approved MDP unless exceptions to these standards are specifically identified in the Planning
Commission’s decision.
E. An approved MDP is valid for five (5) years from the date of approval unless a phased MDP is approved by
the Planning Commission. The maximum duration of a phased MDP is fifteen (15) years.
F. Future MDP applicants must consider, but are not bound by, the FFP prepared for any portion of an
Opportunity Area that does not have an approved MDP.

7.02.3 Identification and Evaluation of Historic Resources. The Historic Resource Survey (Woodruff Minor,
Technical Memorandum 11.3, June 30, 2012) lists, describes, and determines the eligibility of historic resources
for listing in the Local Landmark Register. Not all properties listed in the Historic Resource Survey are
necessarily eligible for listing in the Landmarks Register. A property need not be first listed in the Historic
Resource Survey before being nominated to the Local Landmark Register.
A. The Historic Preservation Commission shall determine and periodically revise priorities for the identification
and evaluation of historic resources based on the community’s needs and interests.
B. Before commencing inventory studies or updates, the Historic Preservation Commission shall provide
public notice describing the inventory, its purposes, and invite public participation. Notification may include
public notices, mailings, web postings, etc.
C. Surveyed properties shall be identified as Eligible/Significant (ES), Eligible/Contributing (EC), Non-
Contributing (NC), or Not in Period (NP). Evaluation and documentation of properties in the Historic
Resource Survey shall meet the requirements of the document “Guidelines for Historic Resource Surveys in
Oregon, 2010” or most recent guidance for such efforts published by the SHPO and be supplied to the
agency within six (6) months of the completion of the study.
D. The Historic Resource Survey shall be maintained as a public record with the exception of archaeological
sites, which is prohibited by State law.
E. Citizens shall have the opportunity to review and correct information included in the Historic Resource
Survey. Any member of the public may place a property in the Historic Resource Survey; however, the
Historic Preservation Commission retains the authority to determine the property’s eligibility for listing in
the Local Landmark Register.
F. The Historic Preservation Commission may collect further information including, but not limited to, current
photographs, architectural descriptions from on-site observations, or archival documentation for properties
already listed in the Local Landmark Register or National Register for the purposes of administering this
Ordinance pursuant to the provisions of this Section.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 43
7.02.4 Local Landmark Register.
A. The Historic Preservation Commission may nominate historic resources to the Local Landmark Register as a
means of providing recognition of their significance and providing incentives and guidelines for their
preservation. The Local Landmark Register shall be maintained by the Historic Preservation Officer and
made available to the public.
B. Historic resources within the City of Pendleton Urban Growth Boundary and listed in the National Register,
including all National Register-listed historic districts in their entirety may be listed in the Local Landmark
Register using the procedures outlined in Section D, but need not be documented as outlined in Section C.
In such cases, the National Register nomination shall serve as the Record of Designation. As Historic
Resources of Statewide Significance, all National Register-listed properties, including individual properties in
recognized National Register-listed historic districts, are subject to the regulations in Section 7.02.5.E,
pursuant to Oregon State Law.
C. Criteria for Designating Historic Resources to the Local Landmark Register. Any building, structure, object,
site, or district may be designated to the Local Landmark Register if it meets all the Criteria of Section
7.02.5.B or all of the criteria listed below:
1. The property is located within the City of Pendleton Urban Growth Boundary.
2. The property is more than fifty (50) years of age or of exceptional importance, or in the case of a
district, the majority of the properties are more than fifty (50) years old or have exceptional significance.
3. The property possesses sufficient historic integrity, in that there are no major alterations or additions
that have obscured or destroyed the significant historic features. Major alterations that may destroy the
historic integrity include, but are not limited to, changes in pitch of the main roof, enlargement or
enclosure of windows on principal facades, addition of upper stories or the removal of original upper
stories, covering the exterior walls with non-historic materials, moving the resource from its original
location to one that is dissimilar to the original, additions which significantly detract from or obscure the
form and appearance of the historic resource when viewed from the public right-of-way.
4. The property has historic significance as demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria:
a. Association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
history; and/or
b. Association with the lives or persons significant in our past; and/or
c. Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; and/or
d. Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
D. Nomination Procedure. Any person, group, or government agency including the Historic Preservation
Commission itself, may nominate a property for listing in the Local Landmark Register. The nomination
procedures are as follows:
1. There is no fee associated with nominating a historic resource to the Landmark Register.
2. The nomination of a historic resource to the Local Landmark Register must include a description of the
boundaries of the proposed nominated area and the structures, objects, and sites contained therein, and
a statement explaining how the historic resource(s) meet(s) the criteria under B of this Section. Any
structures or portions of the property not designated for protection shall be included in the description.
The Historic Preservation Officer may establish additional standards for a complete application.
3. Prior to setting the proposed nomination on the agenda for the next Historic Preservation Commission
meeting, the Historic Preservation Officer shall inform property owners in writing of the nomination
process pursuant to local and state law. To be listed in the Local Landmark Register, the property’s legal
owner(s) shall provide to the City a written statement acknowledging that the owner understands the
nomination process and the results of such a designation, and wishes to have their property listed in the
Local Landmark Register. Within locally-designated historic districts a boundary may be established, but
only those that submit a statement as described above will be listed in the Local Landmark Register. In
cases where multiple persons or entities own a single property, a simple majority of the property owners
must submit a written statement. The City of Pendleton may not object to the listing of a historic
resource in City ownership. This provision does not apply to individual historic resources and historic
districts listed in the National Register.
4. Upon acceptance of a complete application and receipt of written owner consent, the Historic
Preservation Officer shall schedule a public hearing before the Historic Preservation Commission
pursuant to applicable state and local laws.
5. The Historic Preservation Commission shall review the documentation for completeness, accuracy, and
compliance with the “Criteria for Designating Historic Resources to the Local Landmark Register” of
this Section. The Historic Preservation Commission may make a recommendation to approve, deny, or
table the application pending further testimony, or to allow for the petitioner to provide additional
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 44
information as requested by the Historic Preservation Commission. The Historic Preservation
Commission shall develop written findings to support its decisions.
6. Decisions by the Historic Preservation Commission to designate a Historic Resource shall be final
unless appealed to the City Council.
7. Upon final approval, the Historic Preservation Officer shall prepare a Record of Designation that
includes the original nomination materials, and any testimony or additional materials considered during
the nomination process that establishes the eligibility of the historic resource for listing in the Local
Landmark Register.
8. Historic Resources designated as Landmarks shall be noted as such in the Local Landmark Register. The
designation shall apply to the entirety of the recognized Landmark as described in the Record of
Designation regardless of future property division or ownership.
9. A Record of Designation may be amended through the same process used for nomination. The Historic
Preservation Officer may administratively add additional materials gathered under the provisions of
Section 7.02.3 to keep the record current or elaborate on established facts in the Record of Designation.
Notice of such an action shall be provided to the Historic Preservation Commission at their next regular
meeting.
E. Results of listing in Local Landmark Register. Historic resources listed in the Local Landmark Register
receive the following benefits:
1. All uses and restrictions established by the underlying zoning, existing conditional use permits, and
other applicable design standards shall remain in effect unless changed through due process.
2. Landmarks are protected under the provisions of this ordinance.
3. Approval of variances and/or conditional use permits is encouraged in order to promote use and
preservation of Landmarks.
4. The local Building Official shall consider waiving certain code requirements in accordance with the state

Designation shall be altered, relocated, or demolished, or a new building or structure constructed within the
area defined in the Record of Designation without a Certificate of Appropriateness signed and issued by the
Historic Preservation Officer. Certificates must be presented to the Building Official before a building or
demolition permit is issued.
1. An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness must include a description of the proposed activity,

relocation, and demolition of a Landmark. Applications for the alteration of a Landmark may be
approved, approved with conditions, or denied. Applications for the relocation or demolition of a
Landmark may be approved, approved with conditions, or the action delayed for up to one year. The
Historic Preservation Commission shall develop written findings to support its decisions. The Historic
Preservation Officer shall include any conditions imposed by the Historic Preservation Commission in
the Certificate of Appropriateness pursuant to this Section.
5. A Certificate of Appropriateness issued for the alteration of a Landmark shall be effective for a period
of two (2) years from the date of its issuance. A Certificate of Appropriateness issued for the relocation
or demolition of a historic resource shall be effective for a period of one (1) year.
6. A Landmark may be altered, relocated, or demolished without a Certificate of Appropriateness if the
Building Official attests in writing that the condition of a Landmark poses a clear and immediate hazard
to public safety. The comments of the Building Official with sufficient evidence to support his or her
conclusions shall be provided to the Historic Preservation Officer within fifteen (15) days of making his
or her decision. The Historic Preservation Officer will make these materials available to the Historic
Preservation Commission at their next regular meeting. The property owner(s) must submit an
application for a Certificate of Appropriateness as required under this Ordinance within thirty (30) days
of the Building Official submitting his or her written statement to the Historic Preservation Officer.
C. The Historic Preservation Officer may issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the alteration of a
Landmark without a public hearing when the proposed alteration will not significantly change the qualities
that merited the listing of the Landmark in the Local Landmark Register. A completed Certificate of
Appropriateness must be presented to the Building Official before a permit is issued. The Historic
Preservation Officer shall make a list of certificates issued in this manner available to the Historic
Preservation Commission at each regular meeting.
D. A public hearing before the Historic Preservation Commission and a signed Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be required for all activities not exempted in this Section.
1. Prior to submitting an application for a permit pursuant to this Section, proponents are encouraged to
request a pre-application conference to review concepts and proposals. The Historic Preservation

members participating in pre-application conferences shall disclose all ex-parte contact at the time of a
public hearing on the proposal.
2. Upon acceptance of a complete application the Historic Preservation Officer shall schedule a public
hearing pursuant to applicable local and state laws.
3. In order to approve an application for the alteration of a Landmark, the Historic Preservation
Commission must find that the proposal meets the following guidelines as applicable:
a. A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to
its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships;
b. The historic integrity of a property shall be retained and preserved. The relocation of distinctive
materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall
be avoided;
c. A property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a
false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other
historic properties, shall not be undertaken;
d. Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained
and preserved;
e. Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship
that characterize a property shall be preserved;
f. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. The severity of deterioration
requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by
documentary and physical evidence;
g. Chemical and physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used;
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 46
h. Archeological resources shall be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be
disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken;
i. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials,
features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale
and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment;
j. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that,
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.
4. In addition to meeting the applicable guidelines in 3(a) through 3(j) of this Section, in order to approve
an application for the alteration of a Landmark the Historic Preservation Commission must find that the
proposal meets the following design standards as applicable:
a. Vacant buildings shall be weather- and vandal-proofed in order to minimize further deterioration
and the threat to public safety;
b. Rehabilitation work, especially on the exterior and the principal facades shall preserve the existing
historic features or replace them if absolutely necessary with features and materials known to have
existed on the building through verifiable evidence such as photographs. Alterations to Landmarks
shall not be based on speculation, but instead on documentary evidence;
c. New additions shall be subordinate to the original building, meaning lower in height, attached to the
rear or set back along the side, smaller in scale, and have less architectural detail;
d. Height, width, setback, roof shape, and the overall scale and massing of new buildings within
historic districts and on lots with existing Landmarks, or additions to Landmarks shall be
compatible with the existing historic building(s) and, in the case of historic districts, the overall
streetscape;
e. In historic districts and on lots with existing Landmarks, materials on at least the primary façade(s)
of new buildings shall be similar in size, shape, color, and texture to the original materials on the
facades of surrounding historic buildings;
f. Architectural details on new construction (including wood or metal trim, porches, cornices, arches,
and window and door features, etc.) shall be complementary to the original structure(s);
g. Window and door opening should be similar in size and orientation (vertical to horizontal) to
openings on historic buildings and shall take up about the same percentage of the overall façade as
those on surrounding historic buildings;
h. In historic districts and on lots with existing Landmarks, the relationship of the width to the height
of the principal elevations for new buildings and additions to existing Landmarks shall be in scale
with the surrounding structures and streetscape. Wider new building can be divided into segments
that more closely resemble the façade widths of historic buildings;
i. In historic districts and on lots with existing Landmarks, the roof shape of new buildings and
additions to existing Landmarks shall be visually compatible with the surrounding structures and
streetscape. Unusual roof shapes, materials, and pitches are discouraged;
j. Moving Landmarks shall be avoided, especially to create artificial groupings;
k. The demolition of Landmarks shall be avoided whenever possible;
l. Any applicable design guidelines adopted by the Historic Preservation Commission pursuant to
Section 7.02.3.
E. A public hearing before the Historic Preservation Commission and a signed Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be required to relocate or demolish a Landmark or any property listed in the National Register of
Historic Places individually or as part of a historic district.
1. In order to approve an application for the relocation of a Landmark, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall find that:
a. The applicant has completed a replacement plan for the site, including drawings approved by the
Building Official. Plans must be submitted for review by the Historic Preservation Commission
pursuant to standards for new construction; and
b. The Building Official determines and states in writing that the building may be safely removed from
the site; and
c. The value to the community of the proposed use of the property outweighs the value of retaining
the Landmark at the original location. Public testimony shall be considered when making this
determination.
2. In order to approve an application for the demolition of a Landmark, the Historic Preservation
Commission must find the conditions in Section 7.02.6 have been met as applicable; and the property
owner can demonstrate an Economic Hardship.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 47
3. In approving an application for the relocation or demolition of a Landmark, the Historic Preservation
Commission may impose the following conditions:
a. Applicant/property owner shall provide photo, video, and/or other documentation of the
Landmark in its original location;
b. Relocated structures shall be sited to match the previous setbacks and orientation to the extent
possible;
c. Applicant/property owner shall attempt to obtain permission from the National Park Service to
relocate structures listed in the National Historic Register in order to retain the property’s listing
and/or assume all responsibility and cost of removing the structure(s) if permission cannot be
obtained;
d. Other reasonable mitigation measures.
4. At the hearing of an application to relocate or demolish a Landmark the Historic Preservation
Commission may, in the interest of exploring reasonable alternatives, delay issuance of a Certificate of
Appropriateness for up to one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date of the hearing. Not
more than sixty (60) and not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of the delay
period, the Historic Preservation Officer shall schedule a public hearing pursuant to local and state laws
to allow the Historic Preservation Commission to consider if there are still reasonable alternatives to
explore, and if the group will request in writing that the City Council continue the delay for an additional
period of up to one hundred eighty (180) calendar days.
5. The Historic Preservation Commission may not delay the relocation or demolition of a Landmark for
more than three-hundred sixty (360) calendar days subject to the provisions of this Section. At the end
of the waiting period, the Historic Preservation Officer shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for
the relocation or demolition of the Landmark.
6. Upon issuing a Certificate of Appropriateness for the demolition of a Landmark, the Historic
Preservation Officer shall post a legal notice on the property and in a local newspaper of general
circulation announcing the demolition, and invite the public to provide alternatives to the demolition for
consideration by the Historic Preservation Commission within 12 days of posting.
7. Relocated Landmarks shall remain listed in the Local Landmark Register unless removed under Section
7.02.6.
8. Demolished Landmarks shall be removed from the Local Landmark Register using the procedures
described in Section 7.02.6.

Preservation Commission and a signed Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required to remove a Landmark
from the Local Landmark Register.
A. Landmarks concurrently listed in the Local Landmark Register and National Register will be considered for
removal from the Local Landmark Register only after the Landmark is removed from the National Register
and the SHPO has provided written evidence of the removal to the Historic Preservation Officer.
B. Any individual or group, including the Historic Preservation Commission acting on its own initiative, may
initiate the removal of a Landmark or individual property within a historic district from the Local Landmark
Register by submitting a complete application to the Historic Preservation Officer.
C. The Historic Preservation Officer shall establish standards for a complete application for the removal of a
Landmark from the Local Landmark Register. Upon acceptance of a complete application, the Historic
Preservation Officer shall schedule a public hearing pursuant to applicable local and state laws.
D. In order to approve an application for the removal of a Landmark from the Local Landmark Register the
Historic Preservation Commission must find the following:
1. The Landmark has ceased to meet the criteria for listing in the Local Landmark Register because the
qualities which caused it to be originally listed have been lost or destroyed; or
2. The applicant requesting removal from the Historic Preservation Inventory presented written or
documented oral testimony in opposition to the property's being listed in the Local Register during the
public hearing at which the property was so listed.
E. Landmarks accidentally destroyed by natural or accidental act or demolished under the provisions of Section
7.02.5 and meeting the definition of “demolished” as defined in this Ordinance may be removed
administratively from the Local Landmark Register by the Historic Preservation Officer. Notice of this
action and written evidence documenting the demolition of the Landmark shall be provided to the Historic
Preservation Commission at their next regular meeting. This same documentation shall be provided to the
SHPO. If a Landmark is also listed in the National Register, the Historic Preservation Commission shall
request that the SHPO remove the property from the National Register if not requiring the owner to do so
under Section 7.02.5.E.4.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 48
7.02.7 Economic Hardship. The Historic Preservation Commission may grant a Certificate of Appropriateness for a
relocation, demolition, or, at the Historic Preservation Commission’s discretion, modify or exempt a property
from the requirements of Section 7.02.5 if the applicant can demonstrate that complying with the provisions of
this Ordinance creates an economic hardship that prevents the profitable use of the subject property.
A. Separate standards for demonstrating an economic hardship are established for investment or incomeproducing
and non-income-producing properties:
1. Economic hardship for an income-producing property shall be found when the property owner
demonstrates that a reasonable rate of return cannot be obtained from the Landmark if it retains its
historic features, buildings, or structures in either its present condition or if it is rehabilitated.
2. Economic hardship for a non-income-producing property shall be found when the property owner
demonstrates that the Landmark has no beneficial use as a single-family dwelling or for an institutional
use in its present condition or if rehabilitated.
B. Property owners seeking a Certificate of Appropriateness for economic hardship must provide sufficient
information, as determined by the Historic Preservation Officer, to support the application for the
Certificate. Demonstration of an economic hardship shall not be based on or include any of the following
circumstances:
1. Willful or negligent acts by the owner; and/or
2. Purchase of the property for substantially more than market value; and/or
3. Failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs; and/or

Ordinance No. 3791, as amended.
7.06 Umatilla River Subdistrict (U-R)
7.06.1 Description and Purpose. The Umatilla River Subdistrict is intended to encourage the appropriate
development of tracts of land lying adjacent to and within 75 feet of the 100 year floodway of the Umatilla River,
and adjacent to and within 50 feet of the 100 year floodway of its tributaries; thereby promoting land uses
compatible with the existing and potential open-space and recreational utilization of the river system, and to
further the development of the Umatilla River Parkway.
7.06.2 Development Standards.
A. Land uses within the Umatilla River Subdistrict shall comply with the provisions of the underlying zone.
However, new development within the subdistrict that requires the obtaining of a permit under the
provisions of the Structural or other Specialty Code, or that requires excavation or fill within the boundaries
of the U-R subdistrict shall be reviewed by the Planning Director for referral to the Planning Commission as
set forth in B below.
B. If in the opinion of the Director of Planning and Building the proposed structure or use falls within three or
more of the criteria below, it shall require a Conditional Use permit; if less than three, a discretionary
approval of the Commission is required:
1. The construction is valued at $5,000 or more;
2. The construction is two hundred fifty (250) square feet in area or over;
3. The construction exceeds a height of fifteen (15') feet;
4. The construction has potential visual, audible, or odoriferous impacts.
5. The construction involves excavation, fill or other alteration of the landscape included within the
Umatilla River Subdistrict.
6. The construction has a potential negative impact on fish or wildlife, or an archeological resource.
C. In evaluating a proposed development within the U-R subdistrict, whether during a public hearing or public
meeting, the Commission shall base its decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny, on all the
following criteria:
1. Consistency with the policies of the Comprehensive Plan;
2. Consistency with the purpose statement of Section 7.06.1;
3. Recommendations received from agencies with expertise in addressing potential impacts;
4. An evaluation of the economic, social, environmental and energy consequences of the permit request as
defined by OAR 660-16-000.
D. Developers should be made aware in the permit process of the potential for discovering archaeologically
significant areas along the river system corridor. If an archeological find is made, the construction shall cease
for a maximum of ninety (90) days to allow a qualified archeologist to determine the importance of the find
and develop a plan to preserve the site’s value. If a plan acceptable to the Planning Commission is
developed, construction may be halted for a maximum period of one (1) year to allow for preservation of the
resource.

Article VIII. Standards Applicable in all Zones
8.01 Clear Vision Areas
8.01.1 A clear-vision area shall be maintained on the corners of all property at the intersection of two streets or a street
and a railroad. A clear-vision area shall contain no planting, fence, wall, structure, or temporary or permanent
obstruction exceeding two and one-half (2 ½ ') feet in height, measured from the top of the curb, or where no
curb exists, from the established street center line grade, except that trees exceeding this height may be located in
this area, provided all branches and foliage are removed to a height of eight (8') feet above the grade of a
sidewalk, and eleven (11) feet above the grade of a roadway.
8.01.2 Property owners shall not permit the limbs or other portion of a tree, bush, flower, plant or shrub on private
property or on public property abutting private property to project into or extend over a street so that the
vegetation interferes with the use of the sidewalk or roadway, obstructs a driver’s view of an intersection, street
sign or of traffic upon streets approaching an intersection, or otherwise creates a hazard to the public. Where
topography dictates a requirement for retaining walls to provide practical usable yard area, clear-vision area limits
shall not apply to such retaining walls construction.
8.01.3 Measurement of Clear-Vision Areas. A clear-vision area shall consist of a triangular area two sides of which are
lot lines measured from corner intersection of the street lot lines for a distance specified in this regulation, or,
where the lot lines have rounded corners, the lot lines extended in a straight line to a point of intersection and so
measured, and the third side of which is a line across the corner of the lot joining the nonintersecting ends of the
other two sides. Where the lot lines have rounded corners, the lot lines extending a straight line to a point of
intersection with the third side. The following measurements shall establish clear-vision areas: (see illustration)
A. In a residential zone:
1. Where the intersection is not equipped with a stop sign or a stop light, the minimum distance shall be
thirty (30') feet, or at intersections including an alley, ten (10') feet;
2. Where the intersection is equipped with a stop sign or a stop light, the minimum distance shall be
twenty (20') feet, or at intersections including an alley, ten (10') feet.
B. In the C-MU Zone, a clear-vision area shall be required at all intersections not controlled by traffic signals,
for a minimum of ten (10') feet.
C. In all other zones the minimum distance shall be fifteen (15') feet, or at intersections including an alley, ten
(10') feet; except that when angle of intersection between streets is less than 30 degrees, the distance shall be
twenty-five (25') feet.
8.02 Solar Access
The use of solar energy collectors for the purpose of providing domestic energy is a permitted accessory use
within all zones, whether as a part of a structure or incidental to a group of structures in the vicinity. Use of solar
energy collectors is subject to the restraints imposed by the diversity of topography within the Pendleton City
Limits, plus existing structures and vegetation. No guarantee is hereby given that all property within the City
limits of Pendleton is entitled to the use of solar collectors. However; as a general policy, reasonable care shall be
taken to protect the opportunity for the utilization of solar collectors at all of the locations available.
The use of solar skyspace easements is encouraged as a means for property owners to legally record the location
of solar energy systems, and ensure its access to sunlight. A copy of such easement and mapping of the energy
system location shall be filed with the City Building Department; which in turn, will not issue a Building Permit
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 51
to any development that would infringe upon the solar skyspace as set forth in the easement agreement. A solar
skyspace easement shall include:
A. A legal description of both the southern neighbor’s lot and the solar owner’s lot.
B. A detailed description of the easement by bulk plane or sun chart stating precisely the locations of and
restrictions on trees and/or structures on the southern neighbor’s lot, with times of allowed shadows, etc.

(Section 8.05 as amended by Ordinance No. 3890, passed July 5, 2016.)
8.06 General provisions for off-street parking and loading
8.06.1 The provision and maintenance of off-street
parking and loading space is a continuing
obligation of the property owner. No permit
shall be issued until plans are presented that
show property that is and will remain
available for exclusive use as off-street
parking and loading space. The subsequent
use of property for which the permit is
issued shall be conditional upon the
unqualified continuance and availability of
the amount of parking and loading space
required by this Ordinance. Use of property
in violation hereof shall be a violation of this
Ordinance. Should the owner or occupant of
a lot or building change the use to which the
lot or building is put, thereby increasing offstreet
parking loading requirements, it shall be unlawful and a
violation of this Ordinance to begin or maintain such altered use
until the required increase in off-street parking or loading is
provided.
8.06.2 Requirements for types of buildings and uses not specifically listed
herein shall be determined by staff, based upon the requirements of
comparable uses listed.
8.06.3 In the event several uses occupy a single structure or parcel of land,
the total requirements for off-street parking shall be the sum of the
requirements of the several uses computed separately.
8.06.4 Provided, however, that the requirements of this Section of this
Ordinance may be met by a property owner or owners by:
A. Creation of an improvement district, under any bonding act
now existing or which may hereafter be enacted;
B. Creation, subject to approval of the Council, of a jointly owned
and maintained parking area; and further provided that said
property owner or owners so acting may be granted a period of
time to be set by the Council within which time said property
owner or owners may acquire parking area, provided said
owner or owners shall have made contributions to a fund
within the control of the City Council, and in such amounts as
directed by the City Council for the purpose of so acquiring
and maintaining said parking area; and provided that said
contributions shall be paid as directed, and that payment
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 54
thereof shall not be abandoned by said person or persons or any one of them prior to the acquisition of said
area.
8.06.5 Owners of two or more uses, structures or parcels of land may agree to utilize jointly the same parking and
loading spaces when the hours of operation do not overlap, provided that satisfactory legal evidence is presented
to the Planning Commission in the form of deeds, leases, easements or contracts to establish the joint use.
8.06.6 Off-street parking spaces for single family and duplex dwellings shall be located on the same lot with the
dwelling. Other required parking spaces shall be located not further than five hundred (500) feet from the
building or use they are required to serve, measured along the shortest pedestrian route from the building.
8.06.7 Required parking spaces shall be available for the parking of operable passenger automobiles of residents,
customers, patrons, and employees only, and shall not be used for storage of vehicles or materials or for the
parking of trucks in conducting the business or use. Parking spaces and parking areas may be used for transitrelated
uses such as transit stops and park-and-ride/park-and-rideshare areas, provided minimum parking
space requirements can still be met.
8.06.8 Design requirements for parking lots.
A. All parking areas for four or more vehicles shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete or similar pavement so as
to provide a surface that is durable and dust-free and shall be so graded and drained to avoid the flow of
water across public sidewalks. Such parking areas are required to obtain a parking lot permit from the City
Engineer. Permits are required for new parking lots, paving of gravel parking lots and overlays of existing
parking lots. Parking lot permits shall be acquired by the licensed contractor performing the work.
B. Except for parking to serve residential uses, public or private parking and loading areas adjacent to an
existing residential dwelling or in a residential zone, shall be designed to include the erection of a sight
obscuring fence or hedge of not less than six (6) feet in height except where vision clearance is required. A
sight obscuring fence or hedge should be on any side not fronting the street.
C. Parking spaces within a parking lot shall be designed and constructed so that no portion of a parked vehicle,
including an opened door, will extend beyond the property line;
D. Artificial lighting which may be provided shall not create or reflect substantial glare in a residential zone or
on any adjacent dwelling.
E. Access aisles shall be of sufficient width for all vehicle turning and maneuvering.
F. Groups of four or more parking spaces shall be served by a driveway so that no backing movements or
other maneuvering within a street other than an alley will be required.
G. Service drives to off-street parking areas shall be designed and constructed to facilitate the flow of traffic,
provide maximum safety of traffic access and egress and maximum safety of pedestrians and vehicular traffic
on the site. The number of service drives shall be limited to the minimum that will allow the property to
accommodate and service the traffic to be anticipated. Service drives shall be clearly and permanently
marked and defined through use of rails, fences, walls, or other barriers or markers on frontage not occupied
by service drives.
H. Service drives shall have a minimum clear-vision area formed by the intersection of the driveway center line,
the street right-of-way line, and a straight line joining said lines through points twenty (20') feet from their
intersection.
I. All parking areas, except those required in conjunction with a single-family or two-family dwelling, shall
provide a substantial curb which will prevent cars from encroachment on abutting private or public
property.
J. All parking areas shall be adequately landscaped at the rate of at least forty (40) square feet per required offstreet
parking space, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. Parking areas with 25 or more
spaces shall provide landscape islands with trees that break up into rows of not more than 15 contiguous
parking spaces. All parking areas shall be adequately landscaped at the rate of at least forty (40) square feet
per required off-street parking space. This may include hardscape, lawns, shrubbery and trees. When trees
are planned as part of the landscaping – excluding landscape islands- , the owner may exchange one (1) tree
for one hundred (100) square feet of on the ground hardscape or live vegetation thus reducing the required
ground landscaping proportionally, unless other conditions are imposed by the Planning Commission.
K. Except in the Central Area Parking District, all parking areas adjacent to public sidewalks shall be buffered
from the sidewalk (except at gateways and openings) with a minimum of four feet of landscape area with
vegetation consistent with the requirements of Section 8.01.
L. Off-street parking areas shall, at a minimum, comply with the design standards shown in the Parking Design
Table and illustrated in Engineering STD DWG 216 A and B.

Development Director. Such spaces shall not exceed 30 percent of the required number of spaces and shall
not be more than four (4) feet shorter in length than standard spaces.
N. In Commercial zones, parking areas should be, whenever possible, located behind the plane established by
the front façade of the building for which the parking is being provided. The parking should be located to
the rear of the building to the maximum extent possible. Locating the parking lot in front of the building
(between the fronting, public right-of-way and the building) should be avoided. The required parking
minimums in Section 8.03 may be reduced by 25% for developments with the parking located behind the
building. For parking areas located beside a building, and behind the plane established by the front façade
may have a 10% reduction in their required parking.
O. Bicycle parking facilities shall be provided in accordance with the provisions below:
1. Bicycle parking facilities should either be a lockable enclosure in which the bicycle is stored, or a secure
stationary rack which supports the frame so the bicycle cannot easily be pushed or fall to one side.
Racks that require a user-supplied lock should accommodate locking the frame and both wheels using
either a cable or U-shaped lock.
2. Bicycle parking spaces should be at least six (6) feet long and two-and-one-half (2 1/2) feet wide, and
overhead clearance in covered spaces should be a minimum of seven (7) feet.
3. A five (5) foot aisle for bicycle maneuvering should be provided and maintained beside or between each
row/ rack of bicycle parking.
4. Bicycle racks or lockers should be securely anchored.
5. Required bicycle parking should be well lighted and secure.
6. Bicycle parking should not obstruct walkways. A minimum five (5) foot wide aisle shall remain clear.

(50%) of the bicycle spaces should be covered. A lockable enclosure shall be considered as a covered
parking space.
8. All of the required bicycle parking for residential uses should be covered. This may include space
provided in a carport or garage.
9. Bicycle parking should be located on the site within fifty (50) feet of main building entrances and not
farther from the entrance than the closest standard or compact motor vehicle parking space. Bicycle
parking should have direct access to both the public right-of-way and to the main entrance of the
principal use.
10. For buildings or developments with multiple entrances, bicycle parking should be distributed
proportionally at the various public entrances; employee bicycle parking should be located at the
employee entrance, if appropriate.
11. Bicycle parking may be located in the public right-of-way with the approval of the Public Works
Director.
12. Bicycle parking may be provided within a building easily accessible for bicyclists.

8.11 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design is based on the premise that "The proper design and effective
use of the built environment can lead to a reduction in the fear of crime and incidence of crime, and to an
improvement in quality of life." CPTED standards and principles should be considered, but are not required, in
all new development projects, including land divisions.
8.12 Transit Access and Supportive Facilities
Development that is proposed adjacent to an existing or planned transit stop, as designated in an adopted
transportation or transit plan, shall provide the following transit access and supportive facilities in coordination
with the transit service provider:
A. Reasonably direct pedestrian connections between the transit stop and primary entrances of the buildings on
site. For the purpose of this Section, “reasonably direct” means a route that does not deviate unnecessarily
from a straight line or a route that does not involve a significant amount of out-of-direction travel for users.
B. A transit passenger landing pad that is ADA accessible.
C. An easement or dedication for a passenger shelter or bench if such an improvement is identified in an
adopted plan.
D. Lighting at the transit stop.

Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 59
Article IX. Development Design Standards for Land
Divisions
9.01 Blocks
i. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this
prescribed block width shall be permitted due to topography, or in blocks adjacent to arterials, railroads,
waterways, cemeteries, parks, or public land or farmland.
In certain blocks, the Planning Commission may require an easement or dedicated right-of-way through the
block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, pedestrian ways, or bicycle ways. The dedication of pedestrian
or bicycle ways, not less than five (5) feet wide for the travel way, may be required by the Commission through a
block or to connect to a cul-de-sac or where deemed necessary to provide circulation or access for nonmotorized
traffic.
In order to promote efficient pedestrian and vehicular circulation throughout the city, subdivisions and site
developments shall be served by a connecting network of public streets and/or access ways, in accordance with
the following standards. The standards preferably determine minimum and maximum distances between streets
and access ways):
A. Residential Districts: Minimum of one hundred (100) foot block length and maximum of eight hundred
(800) length; maximum two thousand (2,000) feet block perimeter;
B. Downtown: Minimum of one hundred (100) foot length and maximum of four hundred (400) foot length;
maximum one thousand seven hundred (1,700) foot perimeter;
C. General Commercial Districts: Minimum of one hundred (100) foot length and maximum of six hundred
(600) foot length; maximum one thousand four hundred (1,400) foot perimeter;
D. Master planned Developments: Large multi-use sites may be granted a variance from these limits if the
development is developed with multiple users and owners in its final development. These developments may
not include districts solely developed for retail sales establishments or other similar uses that involve high
traffic; and not applicable to the Industrial Districts.
9.02 Lot or Parcel Arrangement
9.02.1 The lot or parcel arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of
topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots or parcels in compliance with
this ordinance and health regulations and in providing reasonable driveway access to buildings on such lots or
parcels from improved streets.
9.02.2 Developers shall encourage solar energy usage when topography allows by ensuring that a maximum number of
lots can be developed with access to active and passive solar energy potential.
9.02.3 In general, side lot or parcel lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a
variation from this rule will give a better street, lot or parcel plan. Dimensions of corner lots or parcels shall be
large enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both streets.
Depth and width of properties anticipated for business, commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 60
provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in this ordinance.
9.02.4 Lot or parcel dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of this ordinance. Where lots or parcels are
more than double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the Planning Commission may require that
such lots be arranged to allow further subdivision or partition and the opening of future streets or other means
of access.
9.02.5 To allow creativity and flexibility in subdivision design and to address physical constraints such as topography,
existing development, significant trees and other natural and built features, the Planning Commission may grant a
modification to the minimum and maximum lot area, provided that the overall density of the subdivision meets
the standards of the zone and every lot has a sufficient building envelope.
9.02.6 Through lots or parcels shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development
from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. Flag lots or parcels
shall also be discouraged, unless deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission to overcome topographical or
other hardships.
9.02.7 A parcel, partitioned solely for the purpose of segregating one separate smaller parcel for an existing or proposed
single family house, shall be exempt from the provisions above provided the parcel to be created for the singlefamily
house shall not contain sufficient lot area to allow further division under the standards of the applicable
existing zone.
9.02.8 Development Permits for siting of new dwellings on any lot more than twice the minimum size of the underlying
zone that would prohibit future land divisions are discouraged unless topographical or other similar constraints
merit consideration of a larger lot in order to achieve a suitable building envelope.
9.03 Zero Lot Line Development
9.03.1 In a newly platted land division, side setbacks may be combined onto one side and reduced to zero on the other
side provided the remaining setback equals the total of both minimum side setbacks.
9.03.2 Zero-lot line houses are subject to the same standards as non-attached single family housing, except that a side
yard setback is not required on one side of the lot. The standards for zero-lot line housing are intended to ensure
adequate outdoor living area, compatibility between adjacent buildings, and access to side yards for building
maintenance.
9.03.3 The allowance of a zero (0) side yard setback is for one single family dwelling on each lot; accessory structures
shall conform to the applicable setback requirements of the zone.
9.03.4 Prior to building permit approval, the applicant shall submit a copy of a recorded easement for every zero-lot line
house that guarantees access onto the adjoining lot for the purpose of construction and maintenance of the zerolot
line house. The easement shall require that no fence or other structure be placed in a manner that would
prevent maintenance of the zero-lot line house. The easement shall not be less than six (6) feet wide and shall not
preclude the adjoining
owner from landscaping
the easement area.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 61
9.04 Flag Lots, Lots Accessed by Mid-Block Lanes
9.04.1 Flag lots shall be discouraged unless topographical constraints limit construction
of a City-standard right of way for access. Flag lots may be created only when a
through street or mid-block lane cannot be extended to serve abutting uses or
future development. A flag lot driveway (“flag pole”) may serve no more than
two (2) dwelling units, including accessory dwellings and dwellings on individual
lots, unless Fire Code access standards are met for more units. When Fire Code
standards are met, the maximum number of dwellings shall be three (3). A drive
serving more than one lot shall have a reciprocal access and maintenance
easement recorded for all lots. No fence, structure or other obstacle shall be
placed within the drive area.
9.04.2 Mid-block lanes shall be permitted when topographical constraints or preexisting
development limit dedication and construction of a City-standard
right of way meeting standards for maximum block length and/or
connectivity. Lots may be developed without frontage onto a public street
when lot access is provided by mid-block lanes, as shown at right. Mid-block
lanes or shared driveways may be required when practicable to provide
connectivity between infill developments. Mid-block lanes with access
easements for adjoining properties may be allowed as an alternative to
requiring through streets where block lengths do not necessitate a through
street. The lanes shall meet the minimum standards for Alleys and Fire
access.
9.05 Access to Lots or Parcels
9.05.1 All lots in any land division shall have frontage on or access from an existing
street on the official map or Comprehensive Plan or:
A. An existing State Highway, County Road, or City street;
B. A street shown upon a plat or map approved by the City Planning
Commission and recorded in the Umatilla County Clerk’s office. Such
street shall be suitably improved as required by the standards of the
jurisdiction, or be secured by a performance agreement or bond as
required by this Ordinance, with the width and right-of-way required by
this Ordinance and the Transportation System Plan.
9.05.2 Driveways Permitted.
A. City Streets. In any district, driveways or access-ways providing ingress and egress to or from private parking
areas or garages, public parking areas or garages and parking spaces shall be permitted and constructed
consistent with the standards in this Section, together with any appropriate traffic control devices in any
required yard.
B. County Roads. Access to lots fronting on County Roads requires a Umatilla County Access Permit, issued
through the Public Works Department.
C. State (ODOT) facilities. Access to ODOT rights-of-way requires a Permit to Operate, Maintain and Use a
State Highway Approach issued through the ODOT District 12 Office at 1327 S.E. 3rd Street.
D. Permits for new driveways or any other form of access to a street not improved to City standards shall carry,
as a condition of approval, the requirement to either improve the street to City standards or provide a
consent to LID to do so at a later date.
9.05.3 Residential lots or parcels shall derive access other than from an arterial street. Where driveway access from an
arterial may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Planning Commission may require that such lots be
served by a combined access drive, or not be served at all, in order to limit possible traffic hazards on such a
street. Driveways shall be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on an
arterial or collector street.
9.05.4 When a land division borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial, the Planning Commission shall
require that access to such streets shall be limited to the following means (and in priority order):
Mid-block Infill
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 62
A. Lots shall be subdivided and parcels partitioned so as to not front the arterial, but to front onto a minor or
local street. Screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the property line common to the arterial of
such lots or parcels;
B. Alleys or dedicated access easements located between an arterial and a local street shall meet all applicable
fire code standards.
C. A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loop streets entered from and designed generally at right
angles to such a parallel street, with rear and/or side lines of their terminal lots or parcels being adjacent to
the arterial;
D. A marginal access street (separated from the arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at
suitable points).
9.05.5 Corner and Intersection Separation; Access Spacing; Backing onto Public Streets. New and modified
accesses shall conform to the following standards:
A. On lots having two or more street frontages, the frontage abutting the street with a lower classification shall
be used for access.
B. On lots having two or more street frontages, all of which are the same classification, the longer frontage
shall be used for access.
C. In all cases, vehicular access on corner lots shall be the maximum practical distance from the intersection.
D. Except as provided under subsection H, below, the following minimum distances shall be maintained
between access points or approaches, where distance is measured from the edge of one approach to the edge
of another:
1. On an arterial street: 300-500 feet based on speed limit or posted speed, as applicable, except as
otherwise required by ODOT for a state highway, pursuant to Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR)
734-051; and
2. On a collector street: 100 feet; and
3. On a local street, 30 feet.
E. New property access on state highways shall conform to the State highway access spacing requirements in
OAR 734-051.
F. New property access on Collector and Arterial streets other than state highways shall not be permitted
within fifty (50) feet of an intersection, unless no other reasonable access to the property is available or could
be developed and a modification in the site design of the property cannot remedy the situation. The
measurement shall be taken from the curb edge, or if no curb exists, from the theoretical curb location based
on the planned roadway section for the given street. Where no other alternatives exist, the City may, at its
discretion, allow construction of an access connection at a point less than 50 feet from an intersection,
provided the access is as far away from the intersection as possible. In such cases, the City may impose
turning restrictions and other traffic management techniques (i.e., right in/out, right in only, or right out
only).
G. Access to and from off-street parking areas shall generally not permit backing onto a public street, except for
single-family dwellings and duplexes. Where no other alternative exists the City, at its discretion, may allow
backing onto a public street from perpendicular or angle parking spacing with the employment of a variety
of transportation engineering or transportation planning techniques designed to mitigate or reduce to a
reasonable level the safety hazard. Required features may include one-way streets with curb bulb-outs,
curvilinear design, and modification of sidewalk locations.
H. The Director may reduce required separation distance of access points where they prove impractical due to
lot dimensions, existing development, other physical features, or conflicting code requirements, provided all
of the following requirements are met:
1. Joint-use driveways and cross-access easements are provided, where practical;
2. The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this Section; and
3. The property owner(s) enter in a written agreement with the City that pre-existing connections on the
site will be closed and eliminated in conjunction with construction of each side of the joint-use
driveway. Said written agreement can take the form of a condition of approval for a subdivision,
partition, development review, site plan review, or recorded with the deed.
I. While the TSP does not restrict private driveway access on urban local streets, residential projects under
review will be encouraged to combine driveway access through joint-use driveways or to access parking off
of established alleys where conditions are practical.
9.05.6 Site Circulation. New developments shall be required to provide a circulation system that accommodates
expected traffic on the site and does not conflict with traffic on adjacent roads. Pedestrian and, as applicable,
bicycle way connections on the site, including connections through large sites, and connections between sites (as
applicable) and adjacent sidewalks, must meet minimum City Standards.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 63
9.05.7 Joint and Cross Access Requirement. The number of driveway and private street intersections with public
streets should be minimized by the use of shared driveways for adjoining lots where feasible. When necessary for
traffic safety and access management purposes, or to access flag lots, the Director may require joint access
and/or shared driveways in the following situations as follows:
A. For shared parking areas;
B. For adjacent developments, where access onto an arterial is limited;
C. For multi-tenant developments, and developments on multiple lots or parcels. Such joint accesses and
shared driveways shall incorporate all of the following:
1. A continuous service drive or cross-access corridor that provides for driveway separation consistent
with the applicable transportation authority’s access management classification system and standards;
2. A design speed of 10 miles per hour and a maximum width of 20 feet, in addition to any parking
alongside the driveway; additional driveway width or fire lanes may be approved when necessary to
accommodate specific types of service vehicles, loading vehicles, or emergency service provider vehicles;
3. Driveway stubs to property lines (for future extension) and other design features to make it easy to see
that the abutting properties may be required with future development to connect to the cross-access
driveway.
9.05.8 Joint and Cross Access: Reduction in Required Parking Allowed. When a shared driveway is provided or
required as a condition of approval, the land uses adjacent to the shared driveway may have their minimum
parking standards reduced in accordance with the shared parking provisions.
9.05.9 Joint and Cross Access: Easement and Use/Maintenance Agreement. Pursuant to this Section, property
owners shall:
A. Record an easement with the deed allowing cross-access to and from other properties served by the joint-use
driveways and cross-access or service drive;
B. Record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along the roadway for the subject property
shall be dedicated to the City and pre-existing driveways will be closed and eliminated after construction of
the joint-use driveway;
C. Record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of property
owners.
9.05.10 Width of Driveway Approach Apron. The width of driveway approach aprons shall not exceed the following
dimensions:
A. For residential driveways, 14 feet for single driveways and 22 feet for double driveways. No more than one
driveway shall be permitted for lots having frontages of 60 feet or less.
B. For commercial driveways, when one or more driveway approaches serve a given property frontage, no
single apron shall exceed 30 feet in width if the property abuts a street where the speed limit is 25 miles or
less per hour; or 35 feet in width where the speed limit is in excess of 25 miles per hour.
C. A safety island of full height curb shall be provided between driveway approaches serving any one property
frontage. Whenever possible, this safety island shall be 22 feet in length and in no case shall it be less than 10
feet in length.
D. In no case shall single driveways serving more than one property be combined to allow greater widths than
stated above.
E. Deviations not to exceed 50%, of the maximum Driveway Approach Apron width limitations may be
considered for Type II Minor Variance approval.
9.05.11 Driveway Surfaces.
A. Driveway surfaces shall be designed for all weather conditions (paved or compacted gravel). Vehicle
driveway and storage areas will not be allowed to be dirt or vegetation. For grades over 8 percent, paved
driveway surfaces are required. All portions of the driveway within the public right-of-way, and at a
minimum of the first 20 feet behind the curb or sidewalk shall be paved as an apron to control gravel.
B. For residential driveways, including private roads, the maximum slope of any portion of the driveway shall
be 20 percent, with an overall average grade of less than 15 percent along the entire length of the driveway.
The maximum grade change in any given 10 feet of driveway shall be 12 percent for a crest situation and 16
percent for a sag situation. The maximum number of houses served by a driveway or private road is three.
C. For commercial or industrial driveways, including private roads, the maximum slope of any portion of the
driveway shall be 15 percent for any point above the elevation of the roadway, and shall be 8 percent for any
point below the elevation of the roadway. The overall average grade shall be less than 12 percent along the
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 64
entire length of the driveway. The maximum grade change in any given 10 feet of driveway shall be 8 percent
for a crest situation and 12 percent for a sag situation.
D. Every driveway approach or entrance to abutting property shall be maintained and kept in safe condition by
the owner of the abutting property. Any driveway approach which is not so maintained or which interferes
with the drainage or safe travel of the street shall be repaired to conform to the specifications of the City
ordinances and the City Engineer or be removed.
E. Driveways less than 18 feet in depth, or those that would force a vehicle to park over an existing or future
public sidewalk, shall be prohibited.
9.05.12 Abandoned Driveways. When a driveway approach no longer provides necessary access for vehicles to parking
areas, driveways, or doors intended and used for vehicles, such driveway approach shall be removed. Upon
removal of any such driveway approach, that portion of the street occupied by the same shall be restored as
nearly as practicable to match the conditions adjacent to the driveway approach or in accordance with design
standards for public streets. Restoration shall include curbing, sidewalk to the nearest grid section, and
landscaping, all by and at the expense of the owner abutting the property.
9.06 Public Parks, Recreation Facilities and Open Spaces
9.06.1 The developer shall dedicate land for parks and playgrounds and other public
purposes in locations designated by the Comprehensive Plan, or in locations
deemed by the Planning Commission, on recommendation of the Parks
Commission, to be appropriate for the public welfare.
9.06.2 Dedication Required. Each land dedication for parks purposes shall be of suitable size, shape, topography, and
location and shall have adequate street frontage and pedestrian access. When recreation areas are required by the
Planning Commission, on recommendation of the Parks and Recreation Commission, the area to be dedicated
shall be based upon the standard of .015 acres of recreation land for every lot or dwelling unit proposed. The
developer shall dedicate all such recreation areas to the City without any reservation at the time of final plat
approval.
A. In single-family residential developments (limited to single family by covenant or other restriction) the
recreation standard shall be based on one dwelling unit per lot.
B. In duplex, multi-family, and high density residential districts (not limited to single-family dwellings by
covenant or other restriction) the recreation standard shall be based upon the maximum number of dwelling
units per acre that could occupy the property as permitted by this ordinance. The only exception to this
standard shall be when a lesser density than that permitted by this ordinance is attached as a condition of
approval of the plat by the Planning Commission. In no case shall greater density be allowed at a subsequent
date without additional dedication or fee payment by the developer, based upon the recreation standards
above and the remainder of this Section.
9.06.3 Minimum Size of Dedication. In general, land dedicated and accepted for recreation purposes shall have an
initial or potential area of at least five (5) acres. The Planning Commission may require that the recreation area be
provided at a suitable place on the edge of the subdivision, or on suitable lands outside of the subdivision but
under the same ownership, so that additional land may be added at such time as the adjacent land is subdivided.
In no case shall an area of less than two acres be accepted for recreational purposes if it will be impractical to
secure additional lands in order to increase its area.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 65
9.06.4 Character. Land set aside for recreation purposes shall be of a character and location suitable for use as a
playground, playfield, or other recreational purposes, and shall be relatively level.
9.06.5 Street Frontage. Any recreation site shall have frontage on public streets of at least thirty three (33) percent of
its perimeter. All land to be dedicated to the City for park purposes shall be marked on the plat: “Dedicated for
park/public purposes.”
9.06.6 Payment in Lieu of Land Dedication. Where, with respect to a particular subdivision and in all cases with
respect to partitions, the dedicating of land pursuant to this Section does not meet the minimum requirements
for park dedication, or in cases when the Planning Commission determines (on recommendation of the Parks
and Recreation Commission) that such a dedication is not in the public interest, the land divider shall pay a fee in
lieu of land dedication prior to final plat or map approval. Such fee shall be deposited in a Neighborhood Park
and Recreation Improvement Fund. This fund shall be used by the City in developing neighborhood parks, play
lots, and other recreation facilities that will be available to and benefit the persons that will inhabit the land
division and surrounding neighborhood.
9.06.7 Maximum Dedication. A land divider shall not be required to dedicate more than thirty percent (30%) of his
land for public purposes, including streets but not including easements. If greater land areas are required for
public use, the Planning Commission may require the reservation of such areas for a period of three (3) years,
during which time the appropriate agency may acquire such land at such price as is established prior to final
approval of the plat or map.
9.07 Noise Buffering
9.07.1 A buffer zone and/or noise barrier may be required by the Planning Commission to protect
and minimize the noise created in new residential subdivisions from arterial streets, state
highways, and the federal interstate system (including on and off-ramps).
9.07.2 Open space areas, landscaped areas, man-made barriers or walls (constructed of wood, earth, masonry, concrete,
etc.) may be acceptable as noise mitigation measures. The location of any proposed or required noise buffering
shall be indicated on the Tentative Plat for Planning Commission approval.
9.08 Pedestrian Walkways
9.08.1 The City recognizes the need to provide safe, non-vehicular access to all areas of the City.
The developer is encouraged to design the land division in such a manner as to creatively
provide for the efficient and secure flow of pedestrian traffic.
9.08.2 Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated rights-of-way of all streets, unless a variance is approved by the
Planning Commission at the tentative plat stage. Sidewalks shall be designed in accordance with street design
standards in the Table 9.1. With the approval of the City Engineer, requirements for sidewalks can also be met by
providing a multi-use pathway consistent with the City of Pendleton Transportation System Plan.
9.08.3 Variances for sidewalks on both sides may be granted by the Planning Commission if:
A. The topography of the site does not permit the reasonable use of a sidewalk; or
B. Some other existing or proposed access way, sidewalk or other facility exists that provides a safe and
convenient bicycle and pedestrian route (e.g. pedestrian and bicycle pathways along the rear or side of the
lot, easements, bridle paths).
9.08.4 Concrete is the standard material for sidewalk construction. Asphalt sidewalks shall be permitted only on
approval of the City Council.
9.08.5 The City recognizes that certain developers may wish to consider more aesthetic materials for the construction of
pedestrian walkways in order to add to the value and attractiveness of the land division. The City encourages the
developer to discuss the construction of such innovative walkways with the Community Development Director
as early as possible in the platting process.
9.08.6 The Planning Commission may require, in order to facilitate pedestrian access from streets to schools, parks,
playgrounds or other nearby streets, the dedication of a strip of land or provision of an access easement at least
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 66
five (5) feet in width for a pedestrian right-of-way. All such dedications or easements shall be noted on the
tentative plan and the final plat.
(Section 9.08 as amended by Ordinance No. 3890, passed July 7, 2016.)
9.09 Pedestrian and Bicycle Access Ways and Multi-Use Trails and Pathways
9.09.1 The dedication of access ways through a block, not less than ten (10) feet wide shall be
required to connect to a cul-de-sac or a long block where it is deemed necessary to provide
circulation or access for non-motorized traffic and potentially emergency access for vehicles.
Design considerations should be considered to restrict non-emergency motorized vehicles
from accessing such ways. Where constraints limit access to pedestrians only, or where it can
be determined that bicycle use may be minimal or non-existent, the Pedestrian Walkway Improvement standards
shall apply.
9.09.2 Multi-use trails should conform to the design standards outlines in the Transportation System Plan Update.
Location and construction of trails must be approved by City Engineer.
9.10 Natural Features and Trees
9.10.1 Existing features which would add to the value of residential development or to the City as a
whole, such as trees, waterways, historic sites, and similar assets, shall be preserved as they
exist in the design of the land division. No trees shall be removed from any land division nor
any change in grade of land affected until approval of the Tentative Plat has been granted. The
Tentative Plat shall indicate the location of existing trees, and whether they are planned for
removal or retention. Trees required to be retained shall be preserved and protected against excavations. The
location of all proposed new shade trees along the street side of each lot or parcel as required by this Ordinance
shall also be shown on the Tentative Plat.
9.10.2 As a requirement for any subdivision or major partition approval, and prior to City acceptance of the street
improvements, the developer shall plant shade trees as established by this Ordinance. Such trees are to be
planted within the planting strip five (5) feet of the right-of-way of the streets within and abutting the land
division, unless this location is altered for utility purposes. A minimum of at least one (1) tree shall be planted for
every seventy (70) feet of frontage along each street unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. A
minimum of two trees per frontage is required. Sleeves shall be provided under the sidewalk for irrigation of the
planting strip. Tree planting is required before the City will establish a Water service account, or other
agreements must be made with the City. Shade trees planted in planting strips shall come from the street tree
manual developed by the City. At the discretion of the Director and where the sidewalks are curb-tight, the
Plantings can be allowed behind the sidewalk or within tree wells.
9.10.3 New shade trees to be provided pursuant to this Ordinance shall have a minimum trunk diameter of not less
than two (2) inches measured twelve (12) inches above the ground level, and be oak, honey locust, hard maples,
or other long-lived shade trees as approved by the Planning Commission. Shade tree maintenance shall be the
responsibility of the property owner.
9.11 Design of Streets
9.11.1 Streets shall be designed consistent with the standards in Table 9.1. Streets shall be designed
consistent with American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) and Federal Highway Administration Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) standards. Consideration shall also be given to the National Association of City
Transportation Officials (NACTO) Urban Street Design Guide. Bicycle facilities may be
designed according to the NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide. This Code recognizes that some other
jurisdictions in Oregon and elsewhere may have more progressive design standards than those contained in the
adopted AASHTO, MUTCD and NACTO guides. Developers have the option of proposing treatments that
have been approved in other jurisdictions, subject to review and recommendation by the Community
Development Director and/or City Engineer. With the approval of the City Engineer, requirements for
sidewalks and bike lanes can also be met by providing a multi-use pathway consistent with the City of Pendleton
Transportation System Plan.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 67
9.11.2 Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to
provide convenient and safe access to property. All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible
of the building sites at, or above the grade of the adjoining streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as
possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided where possible.
9.11.3 Streets shall be graded and improved to conform with City construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the Community Development Director, in accordance with the
construction plans required to be submitted prior to final plat or map approval.
9.11.4 As topography permits, streets within a new land division should be oriented east-west to take advantage of solar
energy applications. East-west streets are conducive to more north-south lot orientations and east-west home
orientations that are desirable for solar access.
9.11.5 All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated
rights-of-way as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan.
9.11.6 Minor streets shall be platted to conform as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through
traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to provide convenient and safe access to property.
9.11.7 A rectilinear gridiron street pattern need not be adhered to, provided the network achieves a similar level of
connectivity.
9.11.8 The use of cul-de-sacs and U-shaped streets may be considered only when a reasonable grid cannot be
accomplished.
9.11.9 Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the property to be divided, unless prevented by the
topography or other physical conditions, or unless the Planning Commission determines that the extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or partition with the existing layout or
the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
9.11.10 In commercial and industrial developments, the streets and other access-ways shall be planned in connection
with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provisions of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflicting movements between various types
of traffic.
9.11.11 In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic
and afford satisfactory access to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation, transit, and street maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardship to
adjoining properties, design standards are set forth in this Section and the Design Standards Table at the end of
this Article. The pavement surface width indicated herein are the maximum permitted and lesser widths may be
approved by the Planning Commission when it can be shown that the projected traffic volume can be safely and
efficiently accommodated on the proposed width.
9.11.12 After sewer and water utilities have been installed by the developer, he shall construct curbs and gutters and shall
surface roadways to the widths prescribed in this Ordinance. Said surfacing shall be of such character as is
suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the surrounding areas. Types of
pavement shall be as determined by the Community Development Director. Adequate provisions shall be made
for culverts, drains, and bridges. All street pavements, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs,
turnarounds, pedestrian walkways, and bicycle ways shall conform to all construction standards and
specifications adopted by the Community Development Director and shall be incorporated into the construction
plans required to be submitted by the developer for final plat or map approval.
9.11.13 Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards designated in this Ordinance shall be required whenever, due to
topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes.
A. In residential districts, a buffer strip at least twenty-five (25) feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of
the lot or parcel required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited
access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots or mapped parcels and shall be designated on the
plat or map: This strip is reserved for landscape buffering; the placement of structures hereon is prohibited.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 68
B. In districts zoned for commercial or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately
parallel to a railroad right-of-way shall, whenever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
C. Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the
extent practical, be at a distance of at least one hundred and fifty (150) feet from the railroad right-of-way.
Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future
separation of grades by means of adequate approach gradients.
9.11.14 The creation of reserve strips controlling access to streets shall not be approved unless necessary to protect the
public welfare or a substantial property right. The control and disposal of the land comprising such strips shall be
placed within the jurisdiction of the City under conditions approved by the Planning Commission.
9.11.15 Dead End Streets. A temporary “T” or “L-shaped” or circular turnaround shall be provided on all temporary
dead-end streets (which may extend into adjoining vacant property as some future date). The plat or map shall
contain a notation that such land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert back to the abutting property
owners whenever the street is continued. The Planning Commission may limit the length of temporary dead-end
streets in accordance with the design standards of this Ordinance.
9.11.16 When a street does not extend to the boundary of the land division or cannot be extended due to topography or
other means, and its continuation is not required by the Planning Commission for access to adjoining property,
its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than fifty (50) feet. However, the Commission may
require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, utilities, or the dedication
of land for pedestrian or bicycle ways. A cul-de-sac turn-around shall be provided at the end of a permanent
dead-end street in accordance with this Ordinance and the City construction standards and specifications. For
greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall be
limited in length in accordance with the design standards of this Ordinance and be appropriately signed.
9.11.17 Temporary dead-end streets shall include clear signage that the street is a dead-end and that it is barricaded.
The sign shall read “Dead End, This road will be extended with future development”. Further the street shall
include a reflective barricade (per Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices) constructed at the end of the
street by the developer and shall not be removed until authorized by the City or other applicable agency with
jurisdiction over the street. The cost of the barricade and signage shall be included in the street construction cost
and born by the developer
9.11.18 Intersections
A. The use of roundabouts instead of traditional intersections may be considered for all
new intersections unless prohibited by topography.
B. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed
intersection of two new streets shall not be less than seventy-five (75) degrees. An
oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be
approximately at right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom. A maximum
of two streets (four approaches) shall intersect at any one point, unless alternative
intersection designs are considered, such as roundabouts.
C. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, whenever practical, coincide with any
existing intersections on the opposite side of the street. Street jogs with center line offsets shall not be less
than 125 feet, except where the intersected street has reserve strips without median breaks at either
intersection. Where streets intersect arterial streets, their alignment shall be continuous. Intersection of
arterial streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
D. Minimum curb return radius at the intersection of two minor streets shall be at least twenty feet, and the
minimum curb return radius at an intersection involving a collector or arterial street shall be at least twentyfive
feet. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practices, as approved by the Community Development Director, to
permit safe vehicle movement.
E. Intersections shall be designed with a grade no greater than five percent (5%). In hilly or rolling areas, at the
approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having no greater than a ten percent slope at a
distance of fifty feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
F. Wherever street intersections will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot or parcel corner
that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to
provide an adequate sight distance. However, the design of any proposed street shall take into consideration
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 69
the location of any existing trees and vegetation. Trees shall not be destroyed for the construction of a street
or other improvement if practical alternative design is available.
G. The cross slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be five (5) percent or less.
9.11.19 Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the Planning Commission, shall be
constructed at the expense of the developer, with no reimbursement from the City. The sharing of expense for
the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant (as determined by the City Council on
recommendation of the Planning Commission) if approved, will be established by agreement. Said cost shall be
charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of vehicular impact of the proposed land division versus the
bridge capacity or potential traffic volumes.
9.11.20 Alleys. Alleys shall be permitted in all zones.
A. The minimum alley width shall be 20 feet unless additional width is warranted due to Fire code or other
applicable standards.
B. Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted, except that the Planning Commission may waive this restriction if
such an alley is unavoidable, provided that adequate turnaround facilities are either provided or deemed
unnecessary to preserve/satisfy public safety needs.
C. Access and utility easements shall be preferred over dedication of ROW for alleys. Maintenance of alleys and
access easements shall be the responsibility of developer and abutting property owners. Any access easement
that may serve future infill development shall be recorded with a reservation for dedication as future rightof-
way.
9.11.21 Perimeter Streets. Streets systems in new land divisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid the creation
of new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new land division, the other half of
the street shall be improved and dedicated by the land developer. The Planning Commission may authorize a
new perimeter street where the land divider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width
within his own land division boundaries.
9.11.22 Where directions of travel are separated by a median, such as with boulevard cross-sections with or without a left
turn lane, the median shall be no less than twelve (12) feet and be provided for landscaping. Planted medians may
be a minimum of six (6) feet in width when separating travel lanes for a road section without center or left turn
lanes in the median. Median shall be planted with shade trees no less than every thirty (30) feet. Trees planted in
medians shall come from the street tree manual developed by the City.

(Section 9.11 as amended by Ordinance No. 3890, passed July 5, 2016.)
9.12 Street Improvements
9.12.1 All streets shall be constructed and surfaced in accordance with the applicable standard specifications of the City.
In a residentially zoned area, if the City requires a developer to install a street with pavement width greater than
36 feet to provide an arterial street or traffic route, the City will pay only the portion of the pavement and rock
base cost in excess of the cost of a 36 foot street. If the City determines that a developer shall install a street with
pavement width greater than 36 feet to provide a collector street or traffic route, the City will have no obligation
to participate in oversizing costs. In a commercial or industrially zoned area, if the City requires a developer to
install a street with a pavement width greater than 36 feet to provide a collector or arterial street or traffic route,
the City will have no obligation to participate in oversizing costs.
9.12.2 In instances where streets will provide direct access for any residential zone utilizing a density of less than 21
dwelling units per acre, the developers shall provide excavation and embankment for every right-of-way within
their development from the back of the curbs and/or sidewalks to the property line to a vertical grade not to
exceed five (5%) percent. In all other instances, developers shall provide excavation and embankment behind the
curb and/or sidewalk to plus or minus five (5%) percent vertical grade for a total width of fifty-two (52) feet for
a thirty-six (36) foot wide street, and sixty (60) feet for a forty-four (44) foot wide street.
If after construction of the street, the land requiring access is changed to any residential zone utilizing a density
of less than 21 units per acre, the developer making the change to any residential zone utilizing a density of less
than 21 units per acre shall modify the direct access streets to provide excavation and embankment of those
rights-of-way within their development from the back of the curbs and/or sidewalks to the property line to a
vertical grade not to exceed five (5%) percent.
9.12.3 When a parcel borders an existing narrow road or street, or when the Comprehensive Plan or other City policies
indicate plans for realignment or widening of a street that would require use of some of the land in the land
division, the developer shall provide an irrevocable commitment to pay for the dedication and improvement of
said substandard street to the full width as required by the Comprehensive Plan and City standards. Land
dedicated for street purposes shall not be counted in satisfying area or yard requirements of this ordinance.
9.12.4 Street names are assigned by the City and reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission at the time of
Tentative Plat approval. All new street names and house numbers shall conform to Ordinance No. 2290 (Street
Naming). A street which is or is planned as a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same name. Names
of any new streets shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other street names in the City so as
to not cause confusion.
9.13 Mail Boxes
9.13.1 Joint mail box facilities shall be provided in all residential subdivisions, with each joint mail box
group servicing at least two, but no more than twelve dwelling units, unless otherwise approved
by the Planning Commission. Joint mailbox structures shall be placed in the street right-of-way
adjacent to the curb as set forth in the design standards adopted by the Community Development
Director. Proposed locations of joint mailboxes shall be designated on the Tentative Plat and shall
be approved by the Community Development Director and the U.S. Postal Service. Sketch plans
for the structures shall be approved by the City prior to final plat approval.
9.13.2 The applicant shall be responsible for the cost for all street name and traffic signs required by the City. The City
shall install all street signs before accepting a street for public maintenance.
9.14 Soil Grading, Drainage, and Retention
9.14.1 Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, final grading shall be completed in accordance
with applicable Code requirements and the approved final subdivision plat or partition map.
9.14.2 Lots or parcels shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings and individual lot or
parcel drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the entire area. Drainage shall be

designed using berms, swales, and other techniques so as to not permit storm water drainage from each lot or
parcel to adjacent lots or parcels.
9.14.3 Each land developer shall be required to furnish and install retaining walls should the Planning Commission
determine that a hazardous condition may exist without such walls. Retaining walls shall be constructed
according to standards established by the City. Any wall greater than 4’ in height or subject to surcharging above
the top of the wall shall be designed by an Oregon Registered Engineer. Such improvements shall be installed
prior to the approval of occupancy of any home or structure in the land division.
9.15 Drainage Improvements
9.15.1 The Planning Commission shall approve a plat only when adequate provisions are made
for the handling of storm or flood water runoff. The storm water drainage system shall be
separated and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers shall be designed to the approval of the
Community Development Director, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with the
construction plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any intersection,
or for a distance of more than six hundred (600) feet in a gutter. When calculations indicate that curb capacities
are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used
to intercept flow at that point. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line; at all changes in size, alignment,
or grade; at all intersections; and at distances not greater than five hundred (500) feet, or as approved by the
Community Development Director. All manholes must be accessible by a motor vehicle. Manhole construction
shall be in accordance with City standard specifications.
9.15.2 The development of commercial or industrial sites, and all subdivision type land developments, shall restrict the
rate and volume of stormwater runoff from the site to a pre-construction/pre-development peak rate for a 25-
year storm. All calculation methods and analysis shall follow the Central Oregon Stormwater Manual.
9.15.3 All drainage facilities shall be installed at the fair share expense of the land divider (as determined by the City
Council) and be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage basin, whether
inside or outside of the City limits or land division. The Community Development Director shall determine the
necessary size of the drainage facilities based on the provisions of the construction standards and specifications
and the adopted stormwater manual, assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the Comprehensive Plan, zoning ordinance, and other regulations.
9.15.4 The developer shall provide a drainage study showing the effect of each development or land division on existing
downstream facilities outside the area of development or the land division for flow greater than a 25-year storm,
and up to a 100-year storm. This drainage study, together with other such studies as shall be appropriate, shall
serve as a guide to improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff` from the development from
an incident greater than a 25-year storm will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, and especially
when it is found that there is imminent potential of downstream property damage, the Planning Commission
may withhold approval of the land division until provisions have been made to upgrade the drainage facility so it
can handle the anticipated flows.
9.15.5 For any land division proposed within a Special Flood Hazard Area, all applicable standards contained in the
City’s Floodplain Ordinance (No. 3791) shall be observed.
9.15.6 Drainage Easements.
A. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities
within the street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines with satisfactory access to the street.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
B. When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside of the land division,
appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat.
C. The applicant may be required to dedicate land (either in fee or by drainage or conservation easement)
adjacent to existing water-courses, in locations to be determined by the Planning Commission to meet the
policies of the City.

9.16 Water System Improvements
9.16.1 Water system design shall take into account provisions for extension beyond the development and to
adequately grid the City system. All public water lines shall be extended through the property served consistent
with City polices and as approved by the Community Development Director.
9.16.2 In an area utilizing municipal water, the developer will be required to install public water lines to acceptable
standards and of sufficient size to meet all demands including fire flow demands, actual and potential, of the area
being developed. The sizes required shall be established by the Community Development Director in accordance
with acceptable engineering standards, but in no case, except in certain dead-end water lines recognized by the
Community Development Director, shall this size be less than eight (8) inches in diameter. Should the City
require water line oversizing in excess of that normally required for the area being developed, the City shall
reimburse the developer in the amount of the difference in pipe material costs.
9.16.3 Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed as requiring the City to furnish water to any land division.
9.16.4 All water lines shall have a minimum depth of thirty (30) inches.
9.16.5 Wherever a water main or service passes beneath a sidewalk, this location shall be permanently identified by
etching a “W” into the concrete curb directly above the water line at the time of street and curb improvements.
9.16.6 Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions and may be required for a partition. Fire hydrants shall be so
located per the Fire Code. The location of fire hydrants shall be approved by the Community Development
Director and the Fire Chief. To minimize future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants,
together with the fire hydrants themselves, shall be installed before any final paving of a street shown on the final
plat. Fire Hydrants shall be installed and flow tested to the satisfaction of the Fire Department, Public Works
Department, and Community Development Director prior to the beginning of any combustible construction.
9.17 Sewer System Improvements
9.17.1 General Requirements.
A. All developers shall install sanitary sewer facilities in a manner prescribed by the construction
standards and specifications of the City. All plans must be approved by the Community Development
Director.
B. All sanitary sewage facilities of any land division shall connect to the City sanitary sewer system. Individual
disposal systems or treatment plants (private or group disposal systems) will not be permitted.

A. These design criteria are not intended to cover exceptional circumstances or situations which may be granted
an exception by the Community Development Director if adequate justification is provided by the applicant.
B. Sanitary sewer design shall take into account the capacity and grade to allow for desirable extension beyond
the development. All public sanitary sewer lines shall be extended through the property served consistent
with City policies and as approved by the Community Development Director.
C. In an area utilizing municipal sanitary sewage disposal, the developer shall be required to install public sewer
lines to acceptable standards and of sufficient size to meet all demands, actual and potential, of the area
being developed. The sizes required shall be established by the Community Development Director in
accordance with acceptable engineering standards. In no case, except in certain dead-end sewer line instances
approved by the Community Development Director, shall this size be less than eight (8) inches in diameter.
Should the City require sewer line sizing in excess of that normally required for the area being developed, the
City shall reimburse the developer in the amount of the difference in pipe material costs.
D. Sewer capacities shall also be adequate to handle anticipated maximum hourly quantities of sewage and
industrial waste, including acceptable allowances for infiltration or other extraneous flow. Sewer line size,
slope, depth and alignment shall be to City standards as approved by the Community Development
Director.
E. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line; at all changes in size, alignment, or grade; at all
intersections; and at distances not greater than five hundred (500) feet, or as approved by the Community
Development Director. All manholes must be accessible by a motor vehicle. Manhole construction shall be
in accordance with City standard specifications.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 75
F. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street rights-of-way unless topography or other extraordinary
circumstances dictate otherwise. When located in easements on private property, all such easements shall be
at least twenty (20) feet in width.
G. Wherever a sanitary sewer line passes beneath a sidewalk, this location shall be identified by permanently
etching an “S” into the concrete curb directly above the sewer line, at the time of street and curb
improvements.
H. Clean outs are required at all points where the service lateral crosses the right-of-way line, and shall be
permitted otherwise only when approved by the Community Development Director.
I. There shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer
which will permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
J. A minimum horizontal distance of ten (10) feet shall be maintained between parallel water and sewer mains.
The sewer shall be constructed of ductile iron pipe or encased in concrete for a distance of ten (10) feet in
each direction from the crossing, measured perpendicularly to the water lines. These requirements are not
applicable when the water main is at least three (3) feet above the sewer line.
9.18 Utilities
9.18.1 All utility facilities, including but not limited to gas, electric power, telephone, and television cables,
shall be located underground throughout the land division. The costs associated to the installation of all utilities
shall be the responsibility of the developer. Wherever existing facilities are located above ground, they shall either
be removed and/or placed underground at the cost of the developer. When possible all utility facilities should be
located within a public utility easement (PUE). Utilities may be located in the dedicated street right-of-way with
prior approval of the Community Development Director. All new subdivisions shall provide a minimum ten
foot (10’) wide PUE outside of, but continuously adjacent to all public right-of-ways.
9.18.2 Easements centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities, both public and private, when deemed
necessary by the Planning Commission, the Community Development Director, and/or Public Works Director,
or upon recommendation of the appropriate utility. Such recommendations shall be made at the prehearing
conference for a subdivision or major partition, and during plat review for a minor partition. Such easements
shall be a minimum of ten feet wide, five (5) feet on each side of the property line.
9.18.3 All utility easements shall be kept free of any building, structure, or tree in accordance with the City easement
standards. If approved, fences, hedges, and other landscaping may be located within an easement, as may parking
areas.

10.02.1 By authority of Ordinance No. 2759 of the Planning Commission of Pendleton adopted pursuant to the powers
and jurisdictions vested through ORS Chapter 227 and other applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, and
regulations of the state of Oregon, the Planning Commission is hereby granted the authority to review, approve,
and disapprove plats for subdivisions or partitions of land within the corporate limits of the City of Pendleton
which show lots, parcels, blocks, or sites with or without new streets or highways.
10.02.2 The Planning Commission may also exercise the authority to review, approve, and disapprove plats for new
subdivisions or partitions within the Urban Growth Boundary but beyond the corporate limits of the City
pursuant to the Pendleton Planning Area Joint Management Agreement between the City and Umatilla County.
10.02.3 By the same authority, the Planning Commission is hereby granted the authority to pass and approve the
development of platted subdivisions or mapped partitions of and inside the City limits, already recorded in the
office of the county clerk, if such plats are entirely or partially undeveloped. The plat or map shall be considered
to be entirely or partially undeveloped if:
A. Said plat has been recorded in the county clerk’s office without prior approval by the Planning Commission,
or;
B. Said plat has been approved by the Planning Commission where such approval has been granted three (3)
years prior to granting a building permit, on the partially or entirely undeveloped land and the zoning
regulations, either bulk or use, for the district in which the subdivision or partition is located, have been
changed subsequent to the original final subdivision or partition approval.
10.03 Land Division Classifications
10.03.1 Under Oregon Revised Statutes, Chapter 92, land divisions are classified as one of two types:
A. Partition (parent parcel into no more than three individual parcels in a calendar year)
B. Subdivision (parent parcel into more than three individual lots in a calendar year)
10.03.2 Land divisions do not include:
A. Divisions of land resulting from lien foreclosures;
B. Divisions of land resulting from foreclosure of recorded contracts for the sale of real property;
C. Divisions of land resulting from the creation of cemetery plots;
D. Any adjustment of a lot line by the relocation of a common boundary where an additional parcel is not
created and where the existing parcel reduced in size by the adjustment is not reduced below the minimum
lot size established by an this ordinance. Such boundary line adjustments shall be reviewed and approved by
the City as set forth in this Ordinance;
E. The sale of a lot in a recorded subdivision, even though the lot may have been acquired prior to the sale with
other contiguous lots or property by a single owner;
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 78
F. A sale or grant by a person to a public agency or public body for state highway, county road, city street or
other right of way purposes provided that such road or right of way complies with the applicable
comprehensive plan and Oregon Law.
10.04 General Requirements
10.04.1 Land Division Approval through Two-step Process. Applications for subdivision, partition or replat
approval shall be processed by means of a tentative plat evaluation and a final plat evaluation, according to the
following two steps:
A. The tentative plat must be approved before the final plat can be submitted for consideration; and
B. The final plat must include all conditions of approval of the tentative plat.
10.04.2 Compliance with ORS Chapter 92. All subdivision, partition or replat proposals shall conform to state
regulations in Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) Chapter 92, Subdivisions and Partitions.
10.04.3 Future Re-division Plan. When subdividing, partitioning or replating tracts into large lots (i.e., greater than two
times or 200 percent the minimum lot size required in the underlying zone), the City shall require that the lots be
of such size, shape, and orientation as to facilitate future re-division in accordance with the requirements of the
zone. A re-division plan shall be submitted for large lots identifying:
A. Potential future lot division(s), consistent with the density and lot size standards of the zone;
B. Potential street right-of-way alignments to serve future development of the property and connect to adjacent
properties, including existing or planned rights-of-way;
C. A disclaimer that the plan is a conceptual plan intended to show potential future development. It shall not be
binding on the City or property owners, except as may be required through conditions of land division
approval. For example, dedication and improvement of rights-of-way within the future plan area may be
required to provide needed secondary access and circulation.
10.04.4 Lot Size Averaging. Single family residential lot sizes may be averaged to allow lots less than the minimum lot
size in Residential districts, provided all lots can show an adequate building envelope.
10.04.5 Temporary Sales Office. A sales office in conjunction with a subdivision may be located in an approved model
home.
10.04.6 Flood Damage. All land divisions shall be designed to minimize the risk of flood damage. No new building lots
shall be created entirely within a floodway. All new lots shall be buildable without requiring development within
the floodway and, where possible, allow building outside of the flood fringe. Development in a 100-year flood
plain shall comply with the National Flood Insurance Program and State Building Code requirements, including
elevating structures above the base flood elevation.
10.04.7 Utilities. All lots created through land division shall have adequate public utilities and facilities such as water,
sewer, gas and electric. Utilities shall be located and constructed to prevent or minimize flood damage, and to
avoid impairment of the system and contamination from them during flooding.
10.04.8 Drainage. All subdivision and partition proposals shall have adequate surface water drainage facilities that
reduce exposure to flood damage and improve water quality. Water quality or quantity control improvements
may be required.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 79
10.04.9 Preservation of Natural Features. In all subdivisions and partitions, due regard shall be shown for all natural
features such as natural vegetation, water courses, historical sites and structures, and similar community assets
which, if preserved and maintained in perpetuity, will add, in the opinion of the Planning Commission,
attractiveness and value to the area and the City as a whole.
10.04.10 Floodplain, Park, and Open Space Dedications. Where land filling and/or development is allowed within or
adjacent to regulatory flood plain and the Comprehensive Plan designates the subject flood plain for park, open
space, or trail use, the City may require the dedication of sufficient open land area for a greenway and/or trail
adjoining or within the flood plain for transportation, storm drainage/water quality, or park purposes in the
public interest. When practicable, this area shall include portions at a suitable elevation for the construction of a
multi-use pathway in accordance with the City’s adopted trails plan or pedestrian and bikeway plans, as
applicable.
10.04.11 Unsuitable Lands. Land which the Planning Commission finds to be unsuitable for land division or
development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
topography, utility easements, or other features which will be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of
the present or future inhabitants of the land division and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or
partitioned unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the Planning
Commission, upon recommendation of the Public Works Director, to solve the problems created by unsuitable
land conditions. Such unsuitable land shall be reserved for uses that do not involve such danger.
10.04.12 Water Bodies. If a tract being subdivided or partitioned contains a water body or portion thereof, the
responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body shall be that of the abutting property owners. Where such a
watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot or parcel from the street by which it has access, provisions shall
be made for installation of a bridge, culvert or other structure of a design approved by the Public Works
Director.
10.04.13 Naming of Subdivisions and Partitions. The proposed name of a Tentative Plat or final plat of a subdivision
shall not duplicate, be similar to, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in
the county. The Planning Commission shall have final authority to determine the name of the land division at the
time of Tentative Plat approval. If a partition name is selected by the developer, it shall conform to all the
requirements of a subdivision name.
10.04.14 Conditional Approvals. Regulation of the subdivision of land, and the attachment of reasonable conditions to
land divisions is an exercise of valid powers delegated by the state of Oregon to the City. The developer has the
duty of compliance with reasonable conditions established by the Planning Commission for design, dedication,
improvements, and restrictive usage of land so as to conform to the Comprehensive Plan.
10.04.15 Conformance to Applicable Rules and Regulations. In addition to the requirements established in this
Ordinance, all subdivisions, partitions and replats shall comply with the following laws, rules, and regulations:

E. The standards and regulations adopted by the Public Works Director and all boards, commissions, agencies
and officials of the City of Pendleton;
F. All pertinent standards contained within the planning guides published by any state or regional planning
agency;
G. The Transportation System Plan.
H. If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the land division greater than those required
by this ordinance, such restrictions or reference thereto may be required to be indicated on the plat, or the
Planning Commission may require that restrictive covenants be recorded with the Umatilla County Office of
County Records in a form approved by the City Attorney. Such restrictions shall not be the enforcement
responsibility of the City of Pendleton.
10.04.16 Sale of Land, Issuance of Permits.
A. Approval of a final plat in accordance with these regulations and the filing of said plat with the Umatilla
County Clerk is required before any owner, or agent of the owner, of any lot or parcel of land located in a
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 80
proposed subdivision or partition shall transfer or sell any such lot or parcel. No person shall sell any lot in
any subdivision or convey any interest in a parcel in any partition by reference to or exhibition or other use
of a plat of such subdivision or partition before the plat for such subdivision or partition has been so
recorded, pursuant to the standards contained in ORS Chapter 92.
B. The description of any lot or parcel of land, by the use of metes and bounds descriptions for the purpose of
sale, transfer, or lease with the intent of evading these regulations shall not be permitted. All such described

recording of the plat of the subdivision, the person subdividing the land described in the subdivision plat
shall furnish to the City Surveyor, prior to approval of the subdivision plat by the City Surveyor, a bond,
cash deposit or other security, as required at the option of the City, in an amount equal to 120 percent of the
estimated cost of performing the work for the interior monumentation.
I. The City Surveyor may require that the setting of the interior corners of the subdivision be delayed,
according to the provisions of this Section, if the installation of street and utility improvements has not been
completed, or if other conditions or circumstances justify the delay.
J. The persons subdividing the lands described in Subsection H of this Section shall pay the surveyor for
performing the interior monumentation work and notify the City Surveyor of the payment. The City
Surveyor, within one (1) month after the notice, shall release the bond or other required security, or return
the cash deposit upon a finding that the payment has been made. Upon written request from the person
subdividing the land, the City may pay the surveyor from moneys within a cash deposit held by it for that
purpose and return the excess of the cash deposit, if any, to the person who made the deposit. If the
subdivider has not paid the surveyor within thirty (30) days of final approval of the interior monumentation,
the City may pay the surveyor from moneys held in a cash deposit, if any, or require payment to be made
from other security.
K. In the event of the death, disability or retirement from practice of the surveyor charged with the
responsibility for setting interior monuments for a subdivision or upon the failure or refusal of the surveyor
to set the monuments, the City Surveyor shall cause the monumentation to be completed and referenced for
recording as provided in ORS. If any other surveyor completes the interior monumentation, the surveyor
completing the interior monumentation shall place the surveyor's seal and signature on the original
subdivision plat and any true and exact copies filed in accordance with ORS. Payment of the fees for
completing said monumentation shall be made by the subdivider within thirty (30) days of the completion of
such work. In the event that the subdivider fails to pay such fees within thirty (30) days, the bond, cash
deposit or other security may be used to pay such fees; and when such cash or other securities are inadequate
to cover the cost incurred by the City Surveyor, the balance due will constitute a lien on any lots in the
subdivision that are still in ownership of the subdivider when recorded pursuant to ORS.

10.08 Planned Unit Developments (PUD)
10.08.1 Description and Purpose. The Planned Unit Development Subdistrict (PUD) is intended to encourage the
appropriate development of tracts of land that are large enough to allow comprehensive site planning, and to
provide flexibility in the application of zoning regulations, thereby promoting a harmonious variety of uses, the
economy of shared service and facilities, compatibility with surrounding areas, and the creation of an attractive,
healthful, efficient and stable environment for living, shopping and working.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 88
The City of Pendleton understands that a developer may wish to propose a project that offers options or
amenities generally not contemplated under a “standard” subdivision or other development within a given zone.
Should a developer propose to submit a development project including public or private amenities, conservation
areas, varied lot sizes and density, neighborhood commercial, or other features, they may be considered provided
the density targets under the applicable zone are achieved. In an effort to encourage creative development
proposals, the standard application procedure for a subdivision shall be followed except it shall be processed as a
Type IV application with final approval by the City Council rather than a Type III.
10.08.2 Development Standards.
A. The principle use of land in a Planned Unit Development Subdistrict (PUD) shall reflect the type of use
indicated on the zoning map for the area. Accessory uses within the development may include uses
permitted outright in any zone, except the EFU, Aviation Activities (A-A) and Heavy Industrial (M-2) zones.
The following Density Bonuses may be permitted in association with an approved PUD:
R-1 – 7.5%
R-2 – 5%
R-3 – 2.5%
B. Size of Parcel. A Planned Unit Development Subdistrict (PUD) shall not be permitted on a parcel less than
twenty (20) acres in area.

and the surplus, if any, refunded to the depositor.
10.11.3 Hearing; determination. At the time fixed by the City Council for hearing the petition and any objections filed
thereto or at any postponement or continuance of such matter, the City Council shall hear the petitions and
objections and shall determine whether (1) the consent of the owners of the requisite area has been obtained; (2)
whether notice has been duly given; (3) whether the public interest will be prejudiced by the vacation of such plat
or street or parts thereof; and (4) whether the Planning Commission has reviewed said request and provided a
written recommendation thereof. If such matters are determined to be in favor of the petition, the City Council
shall by Ordinance make such determination a matter of record and vacate such plat or street; otherwise, it shall
deny the petition. The City Council may, upon hearing, grant the petition in part and deny it in part, and make
such reservations, or either, as appear to be for the public interest.

5. Sensitive lands (wetlands, shorelines, geologic hazard, floodplain, etc.)
B. Transportation Impact Study
1. A transportation impact study shall be required for all development applications in which the proposed
development is projected to have an impact upon any affected transportation corridor or intersection of
local significance, unless the development application is exempt from the provisions of this Section or
the requirement for a study has been waived by the Public Works Director.
2. A transportation impact study shall include, at a minimum, an analysis of the following elements:
a. Trip generation, modal split, distribution, and assignment for the proposed development; and
b. An analysis of the projected impact of the proposed development upon the current operating level
of any affected transportation corridor or intersection of regional significance.
3. A transportation impact study shall be prepared by and/or under the supervision of a registered
professional traffic engineer in the state of Oregon.
4. A transportation impact study shall be based on traffic counts obtained within twenty (12) months of
the date of the development application. The traffic counts shall reflect representative traffic conditions
within transportation corridors and at intersections of significance. The Public Works Director may
request new counts be taken or estimated when recent development renders counts from within the
previous 12 month period to no longer be accurate.
5. A transportation impact study shall analyze impacts on affected transportation corridors or intersections
of significance between the subject development and the state highway system. The City staff will
provide the list of these intersections for different areas of the City, based on analysis from the State
Transportation Planning and Analysis Unit (TPAU). Intersections of significance shall include all those
with an arterial or collector level roadway as defined in the TSP.
6. The Director reserves the right to require an applicant to provide additional data and/or analysis as part
of a particular transportation impact study, where the Public Works director determines that additional
information or analysis is required to implement the standards and requirements contained in this
Section.
7. No traffic impact study shall be required, pursuant to the provisions of this Section, where the proposed
development includes fewer than 50 single family residential units, 83 multifamily units, or 50,000 square
feet of non-residential space.
8. Upon the written request of an applicant, the Public Works Director may waive the requirement for a
transportation impact study, or limit the scope of analysis and required elements of a traffic impact
study where the Public Works Director determines that the potential transportation impacts upon the
affected transportation corridor are minimal.
9. The Traffic Impact Study will be used to determine impacts, and propose mitigation. The City will
negotiate with the applicant to determine the most appropriate mitigation. The mitigation shall then be
provided by the applicant or an equivalent payment must be made so that the City can initiate the
required transportation system improvement project. These improvements must be proportionate and
directly related to the impacts of the proposed development.
10. Traffic Impact Studies shall be prepared by a professional engineer in accordance with the requirements
of the road authority. If the road authority is the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT),
consult ODOT’s regional development review planner and OAR 734-051-180.
C. The developer shall provide proof of review and approval by all affected state and/or county agencies, such
as the State Department of Transportation or County Public Works Department.
D. Where the development site abuts existing curb and gutter, sidewalks in conformance with City standards
(see Table 9.1) shall be constructed in conjunction with the development. If sidewalks exist on none of the
abutting properties, the developer may be required to irrevocably consent to participate in an improvement
district to install the sidewalk in the future. This requirement may be waived by the City Manager if sidewalks
are impractical due to topography. Additionally, with the approval of the City Engineer, requirements for
sidewalks can also be met by providing a multi-use pathway consistent with the City of Pendleton
Transportation System Plan.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 94
E. If City standard public facilities do not exist at the time of development, the developer shall be required to
irrevocably consent to participate in a future improvement district to construct and dedicate all public
facilities, such as water, sewer, storm drainage, pavement, curb, gutter, sidewalk and street right-of-way
adjacent to the development in conformance with City standards (see Table 9.1 for street design standards;
requirements for sidewalks and/or bikeways may be met by providing a multi-use pathway consistent with
the City Transportation System Plan) and provide easement or deeds to the City for all such public facilities.
However, where it is determined by the City Manager that delaying the design and construction of any or all
such facilities is not appropriate and logical, or causes an adverse impact on surrounding properties, the City
may require the developer to construct and dedicate all such improvements as a condition of development.
For water, sewer, and storm drainage facility improvements, the City Manager may waive certain
improvement requirements based on topography or other locational factors that make provision of the
improvement(s) impractical. For transportation improvements, the City Manager may waive or deviate from
public facility improvement requirements for reasons such as:
a. steep slopes;
b. identified natural or cultural resources (in a Goal 5 inventory);
c. existing development;
d. existing legal agreement.
e. an alternative design better serves the designated street functional classification and surrounding land
use.
F. When it has been determined that the extension of public facilities is required, costs related to such
extension shall be borne by the developer as they relate to the development. In addition, any extension of
such facilities shall be continued and extended in a logical fashion through the development site so as to be
readily available for adjacent development. This subsection shall not prevent the City from choosing to
participate in engineering design and public facility construction or oversizing costs.
Where a public or private road has been constructed, created or stubbed in such a manner as to be able to be
extended or widened in accordance with adopted plans, prior approved development or this Section, then:
1. Connection with Adjacent Areas. All residences, buildings or structures shall be constructed in such a
position on the property that they will not interfere with the extension or widening of the roadway to
adjacent areas and shall be so situated that such extension will make orderly and planned development
for additional road installations to meet the reasonable minimum requirements of good and safe traffic
circulation, consistent with applicable zoning setbacks.
2. Right-of-Way for Street Extensions. Right-of-way or private easements necessary to such extension or
widening and falling within parcels being developed shall be granted or created as a condition of
development approval.
3. Provisions for Future Extensions. Any street for which an extension in the future is planned shall be
extended to the edge of the property being developed through the plat, short plat or site plan approval
process, unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Director. The street stub shall include
sidewalks, bike lanes, planting strips etc., in accordance with the Transportation System Plan. The stub
shall include a full street section unless the Public Works Director finds that only a half street or 2/3rd
street width is necessary.
4. Use of Temporary Turnaround. If a road serving more than eighteen (18) dwelling units or more than
one hundred fifty (150) feet in length temporarily terminates at a property boundary, a temporary
turnaround cul-de-sac bulb consistent with this standard shall be constructed near the plat boundary.
The bulb shall be paved and shall be ninety (90) feet in diameter, which may include the width of the
roadway with sidewalks, where required, terminating at the point where the bulb radius begins. Removal
of the temporary turnaround and extension of the sidewalk shall be the responsibility of the developer
who extends the road.
5. The easement for a temporary turnaround may be extinguished without City approval after the
temporary turnaround is determined to be no longer necessary by the City.
6. Barricades. A barricade shall be placed at the end of all stub streets, whether or not a temporary
turnaround is constructed. Barricades must be constructed in accordance with city code, and will include
a permanent sign in conformance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices with the
following or a similar message approved by the Public Works Director: Dead End, This road will be
extended in the future.
G. Where such improvement(s) installed by a developer benefit other properties, a settlement shall be arrived at
between the City and the developer prior to installing the improvements. This agreement shall identify the
benefiting properties, actual costs to be charged and method of repayment to the developer. Where prior
agreement exists for improvements benefiting the subject property, the developer shall make arrangements
with the City for the payment of such improvements prior to issuance of any City permit.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 95
H. Where Required. Bike lanes shall be included in the reconstruction or new construction of any arterial or
collector street if bike lanes are indicated in the Transportation System Plan or as required by the City
Manager.

multi-use pathway, from these standards may be permitted by the City Manager pursuant to Subsections
11.01.04 (E).
I. No building shall be erected on a lot which fronts upon a street having only a portion of its required width
dedicated (as set forth in the Transportation System Plan), unless the yards provided and maintained in
connection with such building have a width and/or depth needed to complete the street right-of-way width
plus the width and/or depth of the yards required on the lot by this Ordinance.

district in which the premises are located.
J. No materials or commodities shall be delivered to or from the property which are of bulk or quantity to
require delivery by a commercial vehicle containing more than two (2) axles or a trailer.
K. Parking of customer, employee, or client vehicles shall create no hazard or unusual congestion.
L. Off-street parking spaces shall not be reduced in size or number, below the minimum required in the

pieces of heavy equipment such as construction equipment on the premises or in the public right-of-way in
the conduct of the home occupation is prohibited.
M. Storage of merchandise, materials, or equipment shall be entirely within the residential structure or in an
accessory building, and shall not be visible from the exterior of the premises
N. Storage or use of explosive, flammable, radioactive, toxic or other hazardous materials that are not normally
found in the home or beyond amounts normally associated with a residence is prohibited. Specific
limitations and requirements for the storage of hazardous materials in a residence are regulated by the
Uniform Fire Code.
O. Home occupations shall comply with all other local, state, or federal regulations pertinent to the activity
pursued, and the requirements or permission granted or implied by this Section shall not be construed as an
exemption from such regulations. Such regulations include building and fire codes enacted to protect the
applicant and surrounding property owners from hazardous conditions. State or local officials may inspect
home occupations to ensure fire and life safety codes are met.
P. Applicants should be aware of any deed restrictions or covenants in effect on a property. It shall be the sole
responsibility of the applicant to research said deed restrictions or covenants and determine if they prohibit
or regulate home occupations.
11.02.4 Procedure. There shall be two types of Home Occupation applications:
A. Type I, ministerial applications shall be approved if an applicant can provide proof that all standards
contained in this Section are met or can be met through specific non-discretionary conditions of approval.
B. Type III, discretionary Home Occupation permits shall require Conditional Use approval for any proposal
that cannot show compliance with all standards contained in 11.5.3. In addition to the application
requirements for a Conditional Use Permit, the applicant shall provide:
1. A written description of the proposed home occupation;
2. A site plan, not necessarily to scale, of the lot proposed for the home occupation, including:
a. The property lines and their dimensions;
b. Outlines of all buildings proposed for home occupation use with dimensions for each wall, and the
distances from each wall to the nearest property line;
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 97
c. Boundaries and dimensions of driveways and parking areas, indicating areas for use by home
occupation employees and customers;
d. Outlines of the foundations of abutting residences, and the distances from the shared property line
to the nearest wall of each neighboring residence; and
e. The buildings and areas of those buildings in which home occupation activities will take place, and
identifying which activities will take place in which buildings and areas.
3. Specific details describing which standards contained within this Section can and cannot be met, and
why.
4. Specific details showing how the proposed use will not be materially detrimental to the stated purposes
of this Code and to other properties in the general vicinity of the subject property;
5. Identification of impacts to surrounding properties and how they will be mitigated;
6. Proof that existing physical and natural systems such as, but not limited to drainage, natural resources,
and parks, will not be adversely affected any more than would occur if the development occurred in
compliance with this Section.
11.03 Caretaker Dwellings in Commercial and Industrial Zones
11.03.1 Purpose.
A. To provide for dwellings in commercial and industrial zones under limited
circumstances and subject to appropriate criteria.
B. To ensure that there is no shift from the accepted limited accommodation
concept of caretaker’s dwellings, to the establishment of a significant residential community.
C. To ensure that residential uses do not impose constraints on the lawful use of land for commercial and
industrial purposes nor compromise the integrity of commercial and industrial areas.
D. To acknowledge that such accommodation may be appropriate for commercial and industrial landowners
from a security point of view, while equally recognizing that the physical environment in industrial areas is
potentially unsafe and unattractive for residents.
E. To ensure that any caretaker dwelling is secondary to the primary commercial or industrial use.
11.03.2 Criteria for Approval. Caretaker dwellings may be permitted only upon findings of fact that demonstrate
compliance with all of the following criteria:
A. The primary use for which the dwelling is requested is permitted within the zone.
B. The primary use for which the dwelling is requested is in active operation.
C. The dwelling shall be located on the same lot or parcel as the primary use.
D. Only one caretaker dwelling may be permitted as accessory to a primary use or uses on one lot or parcel.
E. The existence of multiple business entities on one lot or parcel shall not be justification for additional caretaker
dwellings.
F. The applicant must demonstrate that the dwelling is necessary for the security or operation of the primary use.
G. The dwelling shall be occupied only by individuals (and immediate family) employed at the site in the capacity of
a caretaker or watchman.
H. The dwelling shall not exceed 1,200 square feet in total enclosed area.

J. The dwelling shall be designed so that it may be removed from the property or converted to a permitted use if
the primary use is abandoned for more than 365 days.
K. Caretaker dwellings shall be clearly incidental to the primary commercial or industrial use. If the relationship
between the dwelling and the associated use is within what could be approved as a home occupation, the request
for a caretaker dwelling shall be denied.
11.03.3 Process. Caretaker Dwelling applications shall be processed as a Type III Conditional Use application.
11.04 Variances
11.04.1 Purpose. This Code cannot provide standards to fit every potential development situation. Variances are
modifications to land use or development standards that are not otherwise permitted elsewhere in this Code. The
variance procedures provide relief from specific code provisions when they have the unintended effect of
preventing reasonable development in conformance with applicable standards and requirements. The variance
procedures are intended to provide flexibility while ensuring that the intent of this Code is met.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 98
11.04.2 The Planning Commission may authorize variances from the requirements of this Ordinance where it can be
shown that, owing to special and unusual circumstances related to a specific piece of property, strict application
of the Ordinance would cause an undue or unnecessary hardship.
11.04.3 Allowances. Unless specifically stated otherwise, a person or party may apply for a variance from any standard
contained herein.
11.04.4 Findings of fact. In order to grant any Variance, the Planning Commission must find, based upon evidence
provided by the applicant, both factual and supportive, that:
A. Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances apply to the property which do not apply generally to other
properties in the same zone or vicinity, and result from lot size or shape, legally existing prior to the date of
this Ordinance, topography, or other circumstances over which the applicant has no control.
B. The variance is necessary for the preservation of a property right of the applicant substantially the same as
owners of other property in the same zone or vicinity possessed.
C. The variance would not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this Ordinance, or to property in the
zone or vicinity in which the property is located, or otherwise conflict with the objectives of any City plan or
policy.
D. The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the hardship.
11.04.5 Conditions of Approval. In granting a variance, the Planning Commission may attach conditions which it finds
necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property or neighborhood or to otherwise achieve the
purposes of this Ordinance.
11.04.6 Limitations. No variance shall allow the use of property for a purpose not authorized within the zone in which
the proposed use would be located.
11.04.7 Procedure. Variance applications shall be processed according to the standards for a Type III application
contained in Article 13.
11.04.8 Appeal. Appeal of a Variance shall be processed according to the standards for appeal of a Type III decision
contained in Article 13.
11.05 Minor Variances
11.05.1 Certain Minor Variances which are less likely to result in a change to neighborhood character may be approved
by the Planning Director without a public hearing.
11.05.2 Allowances. Only those specific deviations identified herein shall be eligible for approval of a Minor Variance.
A. Deviation from lot coverage requirements of 5% or less.
B. Deviation from lot size or building height requirements of 10% or less.
C. Deviation from minimum setbacks:
1. Front Yard: No reduction.
2. Side Yard Abutting a Street: minimum 8 feet.
3. Side and Rear Yards: minimum 3 feet.

E. Front Yard Fence and Wall Waivers. Waiver of the front and side yard (3.5') fence provisions may be sought
by any person who proves he can provide equal aesthetic qualities by other means. The Director shall
consider such application on the basis of aesthetic value of the substitute plan. The substitute plan must:
1. Provide adequate vision clearance for automobiles, both those passing on the street and those leaving
the development site;
2. Include landscaping;
3. Not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or be materially injurious to properties or
improvements in the vicinity.
11.05.3 Approval criteria. A Type II Variance shall be granted only if the request falls within established allowances.
11.05.4 Procedure. Minor Variance applications shall be processed according to the standards for a Type II application
contained in Article 13.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 99
11.05.5 Appeal. Appeal of a Minor Variance shall be processed according to the standards for appeal of a Type II
decision contained in Article 13.
11.06 Conditional Use Permits
11.06.1 Purpose. In all zones, conditional uses may be permitted subject to the granting of a conditional use permit.
Because of their unusual characteristics, or the special characteristics of the area in which they are to be located,
conditional uses require special consideration so that they may be properly located with respect to the objectives
of this ordinance and their effect on surrounding properties.
The Planning Commission shall have the authority to approve, approve with conditions, disapprove or revoke
conditional use permits subject to the provisions of this Section. Changes in use, expansion or contraction of site
area, or alteration of structure or uses classified as conditional and existing prior to the effective date of this
ordinance shall conform to all regulations pertaining to conditional uses.
11.06.2 Allowances. Those uses specifically identified as Conditional Uses in this Code may be considered for approval.
This Code cannot anticipate every potential development proposal; uses that are similar in nature and impact to
those that may be considered under the Conditional Use procedure, pursuant to a formal interpretation by the
Planning Commission, may be processed and considered for approval under these standards.
11.06.3 Findings of fact. In order to grant any conditional use, the Planning Commission must find, based upon
evidence, both factual and supportive, provided by the applicant, that:
A. The site for the proposed use is adequate in size and shape to accommodate said use and all yards, spaces,
walls and fences, parking, loading, landscaping and other features required by this ordinance.
B. The site for the proposed use relates to streets and highways adequate in width and degree of improvement
to handle the quantity and kind of vehicular traffic that would be generated by the proposed use.
C. Any negative impacts of the proposed use on adjacent properties and on the public can be mitigated through
application of other ordinance standards, or other reasonable conditions of approval.
D. In areas designated as requiring preservation of historic, scenic or cultural resources and attributes, proposed
structures will be of a design complimentary to the surrounding area.
11.06.4 Conditions of approval. In permitting a conditional use, the Planning Commission may impose, in addition to
regulations and standards expressly specified in this ordinance, other conditions found necessary to protect the
best interests of the surrounding property or neighborhood, or the City as a whole. These conditions may
include, but not be limited to, the following:
A. Increasing required lot size, yard dimensions, open spaces or buffer areas.
B. Requiring fences, walls or landscape screening and/or buffering where necessary to reduce noise, glare and
maintain the property in a character in keeping with the surrounding area.
C. Requiring landscaping and maintenance thereof.
D. Increasing street widths, controlling the location and number of vehicular access points to the property for
ingress/egress.
E. Requiring means of pedestrian/bicycle access pathways to serve the property.
F. Increasing the number of off-street parking and loading spaces required; surfacing and proper drainage of
parking areas.
G. Limiting size, location and number of signs.
H. Limiting the location, coverage or height of buildings because of obstruction to view and reduction of light
and air to adjacent property.
I. Limiting or prohibiting openings in sides of buildings or structures.
J. Enclosure of storage areas and limitation of outside display and/or storage of merchandise.
K. Requiring maintenance of grounds.
L. Regulation of noise, vibration, odors, etc.
M. Regulation of time for certain activities.
N. Establishing a time period within which the proposed use shall be developed.
O. The requirement of a bond for removal of such use within a specified period of time.
P. Increase the size, type or capacity of any or all utility services, facilities or appurtenances.
Q. Requirements under which any future enlargement or alteration of the use shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission and new conditions imposed.
R. The Planning Commission may require that an applicant furnish the City a performance bond with a
contractual agreement to assure its share of the development of streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, water,
sanitary sewers, storm sewers or other necessary and essential public improvements to City standards; or an
irrevocable consent to participate in an LID for those improvements has been executed.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 100
S. And such other conditions as will make possible the development of the City in an orderly and efficient
manner and in conformity with the intent and purposes set forth in this Section.
11.06.5 Limitations. A conditional use permit shall not grant variances to regulations otherwise prescribed by the
Development Code. Variance application(s) may be filed in conjunction with the conditional use application, and
both applications may be reviewed at the same hearing.
11.06.6 Procedure. Conditional Use applications shall be processed according to the standards for a Type III application
contained in Article 13.
11.06.7 Appeal. Appeal of a Conditional Use shall be processed according to the standards for appeal of a Type III
decision contained in Article 13.
11.06.8 Alterations. The Commission may establish standards under which any future enlargement or alteration of the
use shall (or shall not) require a new or modified Conditional Use application.
11.06.9 Revocation. Upon a determination that there are sufficient grounds, the Planning Commission may at any time
initiate a review of the operation of any Conditional Use. A review shall be initiated if the Planning Director
receives three documented and unresolved complaints within six months that a conditional use has not complied
with the applicable conditions of approval or the applicable standards of this Section. If a review is initiated, the
Commission shall hold a public hearing to determine whether the use is in compliance with applicable standards
and conditions. Review of an existing Conditional Use shall be processed as a Type III procedure consistent with
the standards for a new Conditional Use. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning Commission shall adopt
findings of compliance or non-compliance for the conditional use. Upon adoption of findings of noncompliance,
the property owner(s) shall submit a compliance schedule documenting that compliance will be
achieved within forty-five (45) days or a shorter period of time if the Commission determines there is a cause for
emergency action. Receipt of further documented and unresolved complaints will result in revocation of the
conditional use permit.
11.07 Pre-Existing, Non-Conforming Uses and Developments
11.07.1 Non-Conforming Uses are existing uses or development that do not comply with the Code. The standards for
non-conforming uses and development are intended to provide some relief from code requirements for uses and
developments that were established prior to the effective date of this Code and do not comply with current
standards.
Except as is hereinafter provided in this Ordinance, the lawful use of a building or structure or of any land or
premises lawfully existing at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance or at the time of a change in the
official zoning maps may be continued although such use does not conform with the provisions of this
Ordinance. No unlawful use of property existing at the time of passage of this Ordinance shall be deemed a nonconforming
use.
11.07.2 Continuation of Nonconforming Uses. Where at the time of adoption of this Code a use of land exists which
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Code and was lawful at the time it was established,
the use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
A. Expansion Prohibited. No such nonconforming use may be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a
greater area of land or space than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code.
No additional structure, building or sign shall be constructed on the lot in connection with such
nonconforming use of land;
B. Location. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot other
than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code;
C. Discontinuation or Abandonment. The nonconforming use of land is not discontinued for any reason for a
period of more than 12 months. For purposes of calculating the 12-month period, a use is discontinued or
abandoned upon the occurrence of the first of any of the following events:
1. On the date when the use of land is physically vacated;
2. On the date the use ceases to be actively involved in the sale of merchandise or the provision of
services;
3. On the date of termination of any lease or contract under which the nonconforming use has occupied
the land; or
4. On the date a request for final reading of water and power meters is made to the applicable utility
districts.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 101
D. Application of Code Criteria and Standards. If the use is discontinued or abandoned for any reason for a
period of more than 12 months, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the applicable standards and
criteria specified by this Code for the land use district in which such land is located.
11.07.3 Non-conforming Development. Where a development exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this Code that could not be built under the terms of this Code by reason of restrictions on lot area, lot
coverage, height, yard, equipment, access, parking, landscaping, its location on the lot or other requirements
concerning the development; and the development was lawful when constructed, the development may remain
on the site so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. Alterations. No such nonconforming development may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its
nonconformity, but any development or portion thereof may be enlarged or altered in a way that satisfies the
current requirements of this Code or will decrease its nonconformity;
B. Destruction. Should such nonconforming development or nonconforming portion of development be
destroyed by any means to an extent more than 50 percent of its current value as assessed by the Umatilla
County Assessor, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with this Code;
C. Roadway Access. The owner of a non-conforming access connection (i.e., street or highway access) may be
required to bring the non-conforming access into conformance with this Code and other applicable
standards as a condition of the City or other roadway authority approving a new access connection permit,
or a change in land use.
D. Relocation or Removal. Should such development be moved for any reason and by any distance, it shall
thereafter conform to the regulations of this Code.
11.07.4 Nonconforming Lots of Record.
A. In any zoning district in which single family dwellings are permitted, a single family dwelling and accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record in existence on the date of this Ordinance,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
B. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area that are applicable in
the zoning district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area of the
lot shall conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard
requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Planning Commission.
C. If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record on the date of this Ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot areas, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purposes of this Ordinance, and no portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot size requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any division of any
parcel be made which creates a lot with a size below the requirements stated in this Ordinance.
11.07.5 Alterations or Repairs of a Non-Conforming Use.
A. Alterations or repairs of a non-conforming use may be permitted to continue the use in a reasonable manner
subject to the provisions of this Ordinance. Alteration of any such use shall be permitted when necessary to
comply with any lawful requirement for alteration in the use.
B. Any proposal for the alteration or repair of a non-conforming use may be permitted to reasonably continue,
restore or replace the use.
C. As used in this Section, “alteration” of a non-conforming use includes, as determined by the City Manager:
1. A change in the use of no greater adverse impact to the neighborhood; and
2. A change in the structure or physical improvements of no greater adverse impact to the neighborhood.
D. A non-conforming use may be altered only insofar as it applies to the zone in which it is located. Once
altered to conforming use, no building or land shall be permitted to revert to a non-conforming use.
11.07.6 Restoration of a Non-Conforming Building, Structure or Lot.
A. A non-conforming building or structure which is damaged by fire, flood, wind, earthquake or other calamity
or act of God or the public enemy, may be restored, and the occupancy or use of such building or structure
or part thereof, which existed at the time of such partial destruction, may be resumed, provided that the
restoration is commenced within a period of one (1) year and is diligently prosecuted to completion.
B. The restoration or reconstruction of a non-conforming building or structure may not create a greater nonconformance
than existed at the time of damage or destruction.
C. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed to prevent the reconstruction or replacement of a pre-existing
building or structure conforming as to use on a non-conforming lot, so long as such lot did not become
non-conforming in violation of the provisions of this Ordinance.
Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 102
11.07.7 Creation of a Non-Conformance through a Land Use Action Prohibited
A. No action shall be approved that would result in the creation or increase of a non-conformance with this or
any other City of Pendleton ordinance and all applicable Oregon State Specialty Codes, unless expressly
permitted by same.
B. For any proposed land division, boundary line adjustment or replat, the City shall require as a condition of
approval that any violation or non-conformance be remedied prior to submittal of a final plat.
C. Non-conformances created as a result of right-of-way dedication or condemnation are exempt from this
prohibition.
11.08 Temporary Uses
11.08.1 Temporary Uses. The City Planning Commission shall, upon petition, notice and hearing, recommend to the
City Council the granting or denying of a temporary permit to use certain specified property for a purpose not
authorized in the zone in which such property is located, subject to such limitations and conditions as are
necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property or the City as a whole. Such temporary permit
may be granted by motion, shall be revocable at the will of the City Council, and subject to such other limitations
and conditions as the City Council may impose.
11.08.2 Permit Criteria. The City Planning Commission and City Council shall grant a temporary use permit ONLY

Ordinance 3845, City of Pendleton Unified Development Code 4/8/2020 4:32 PM 104
Article XIII. Land Use Application Procedure
13.01 Application Submittal and Completeness Review

state law, comprehensive plan, and implementing ordinance provisions. All applications provided for in this
Ordinance shall be made on the application forms prescribed by the City.
B. The Director shall supply checklists or information sheets for applications, which shall detail the specific
information which must be contained in the application, including format and number of copies. Such
checklists may be incorporated into the application forms.
13.01.2 Who May Apply
A. An application for a Special Permit may be filed by:
1. The owner or the contract purchaser of the subject property, or any person authorized in writing to act
as agent of the owner or contract purchaser.
2. The City Council, Planning Commission, City Manager, or the City Manager’s designee, as to property
owned by the City, including public right of way and easements, or which the City intends to acquire.
3. Public agencies that own the property or have passed a resolution declaring that they intend to exercise
their statutory authority to condemn the property.
B. A Text Amendment application may be filed by an interested person, City Council, Mayor, or Director.

contract purchaser of the subject property, City Council, Mayor, or Director.
D. A Zoning Map Amendment application subject to a Type IV procedure may be filed only by the City
Council, Mayor, City Manager, or the City Manager’s designee.
13.01.3 Classification of Applications
A. All applications shall be subject to the procedure type specified in this Code. If the Code does not specify a
procedure type for a given application and another procedure is not required by law, the Director shall
determine the appropriate procedure based on the following guidelines. Where two or more procedure types
could be applied to a particular application, the selected procedure will be the type providing the broadest
notice and opportunity to participate.
1. A Type I (Ministerial) application is subject to non-discretionary criteria or criteria that require the
exercise of professional judgment only about technical issues.
2. A Type II (Ministerial) application is subject to criteria that require the exercise of limited discretion
about non-technical issues and about which there may be limited public interest.
3. A Type III (Quasi-Judicial) application is subject to criteria that require the exercise of substantial
discretion and about which there may be broad public interest, although the application applies to a
limited number of land owners and properties.
4. A Type IV (Legislative) procedure typically involves the adoption, implementation or amendment of
policy or law by ordinance. The subject of a Type IV procedure generally applies to a relatively large
geographic area containing many property owners.
5. When an applicant submits more than one complete application for a given proposal, where each
application addresses a separate set of code requirements and the applications are subject to different
procedure types, all of the applications are subject to the procedure type of the application which
requires the broadest notice and opportunity to participate. For example, a Type II application will be
consolidated with a Type III application for the same proposal on the same site, in which case, the Type
II application will be reviewed by the decision making authority of the Type III application. The
decision making authority’s action on the Type II application will be based on the approval criteria
governing the Type II application.
B. In the event that the completed applications involve applications where the decision making authority is a
combination of the Director and the Planning Commission, the decision making authority will be the
Planning Commission.
C. Notwithstanding any other provision and at no cost to the applicant, the Director may choose to combine
multiple applications for the same development as a way to increase the efficiency of development review.
D. For applications within the Historic District, the Director shall determine the appropriate decision-making
authority between the Façade Committee, the Landmarks Commission and the Planning Commission. Such
determination will be based upon the characteristics of the proposal and the associated application, if any.

application submitted directly to the Planning Commission provided the applicant pays the appropriate fee
for the selected procedure type and the Director determines that statutory timelines for reaching a final
decision can be satisfied.
F. Notwithstanding any other provision, and at no additional cost to the applicant, the Director may choose to

opportunity to participate than would otherwise be required, or in order to comply with the time
requirements for reviewing development applications pursuant to ORS 227.178.

future debt for the improvements. An increase in system capacity occurs if a capital
improvement increases the level of performance or service provided by existing facilities or
providing new facilities. The portion of the capital improvements funded by improvement fees
must be related to demands created by current or projected development. A capital improvement
being funded wholly or in part from revenues derived from the improvement fee shall be
included in the plan adopted by the city pursuant to Section 8 of this ordinance.

persons who have requested notice pursuant to Section 13 of this ordinance; and
B. Hold a public hearing if a written request for a hearing is received within seven days of
the date of the proposed modification.
8.4 A change in the amount of a reimbursement fee or an improvement fee is not a modification of
the SDC if the change in amount is based on a change in the cost of materials, labor, or real
property applied to the projects or project capacity, as set forth in the plan adopted pursuant to
9-26
5
Section 8 of this ordinance; or the periodic application of one or more specific cost indexes or
other periodic data sources. A specific cost index or periodic data source must be:
A. A relevant measurement of the average in change in prices or costs over an identified
time period for materials, labor, real property, or a combination of the three;
B. Published by a recognized organization or agency that produces the index or data source
for reasons that are independent of the system development charge methodology; and

9.2 If no building, development, or connection permit is required, the SDC is payable at the time
the usage of the capital improvement is increased.
9.3 If development commenced or connection is made to the water or sewer systems without an
appropriate permit, the SDC is immediately payable upon the earliest date that a permit was
required.
9.4 Community Development Department shall collect the applicable SDC(s) when one of the
following events is initiated:
A. Upon issuance of a permit which allows expansion of an existing building or
development of an existing parcel.
B. When a request is made for water or sewer service, or when a connection to the water or
sewer system of the city is made, whichever event occurs first.
9.5 Community Development Department shall not issue such permit or allow such connection until
the charge has been paid in full at the time of occurrence of one of the events outlined in Section
9.4, or until provision for installment payments has been made pursuant to Section 10 of this
ordinance, or unless an exemption is granted pursuant to Section 11; or a credit has been made
pursuant to Section 12 of this ordinance.
Section 10. Installment Payment.
10.1 The owner of the parcel of land subject to the SDC may apply for payment in 20 semi-annual
installments, to include interest on the unpaid balance, in accordance with ORS 223.208.
10.2 The City shall provide application forms for installment payments, which shall include a waiver
of all rights to contest validity of the lien, except for the correction of computational errors.
10.3 An applicant for installment payments shall have the burden of demonstrating the applicant’s

lien upon the described parcel for the amount of the SDC, together with interest on the unpaid
balance at the rate established by the Council. The lien shall be enforceable in the manner
provided in ORS Chapter 223.
10.6 Upon written request of the Community Development Department, the City Manager is
authorized to cancel assessments of SDCs, without further Council action, where the new
development approved by the building permit is not constructed and the building permit is
cancelled.
10.7 For property that has been subject to a cancellation of assessment of SDCs, a new installment
payment contract shall be subject to the code provisions applicable to SDCs and installment
payment contracts on file on the date the new contract is received by the city.
Section 11. Exemptions.
11.1 Existing water and sewer connections, to the extent of current service levels as of the effective
date of this ordinance, are exempt from a SDC(s). Additions to single-family dwellings that do
not constitute the addition of a dwelling unit, as defined by the State Uniform Building Code,
are exempt from all portions of the system development charge. An alteration, addition,
replacement, or change in use that does not increase the use of a public improvement facility is
exempt from all portions of the SDC. Municipal projects are exempt from all SDC.
11.2 Residential fire sprinkler systems:
A. Fire sprinkler systems for residential development served by 3/4-inch water meter
service: An applicant seeking to install a fire suppression sprinkler system in an existing
residential structure or a new residential structure, shall be exempt from paying any
additional water system development charge for installation of such a sprinkler system,
provided the applicant furnishes a written statement from the licensed plumber installing
the sprinkler system, that the sole reason for increasing the size of the meter serving the
sprinkler system from a 3/4-inch to a 1-inch size water meter is the installation of the
sprinkler system. City has the right to verify the submitted information by consulting
with the State Plumbing Inspector. Following installation of the sprinkler system, the
applicant shall pay the normal rate established by Council resolution for service
provided by a 1-inch water meter, which rate shall also apply to the amount of water
usage generated when the fire sprinkler system is activated.
B. Fire sprinkler systems for residential development served by 1-inch water meter service:
An applicant who has an existing 1-inch size water meter for a residential structure, who
seeks to install a fire sprinkler system and is required to install a larger service line for
any reason other than the installation of a fire sprinkler system (for example, a need to
provide a large quantity for outdoor irrigation), would not qualify for the exemption
from the water system development charge provided in Section 11.1.A.
Section 12. Credits.
12.1 When a development occurs that is subject to a SDC, the SDC for the existing use, if applicable,
shall be calculated and if it is less than the SDC for the use that will result from the
9-26
7
development, the difference between the SDC for the existing use and the SDC for the proposed
use shall be the SDC. If the change in the use results in the SDC for the proposed use being less
than the SDC for the existing use, no SDC shall be required. No refund or credit shall be given
unless provided for by another subsection of this Section.
12.2 A credit shall be given to the permittee for the cost of a qualified public improvement upon
acceptance by the city of the public improvement. The credit shall not exceed the improvement
fee even if the cost of the capital improvement exceeds the applicable improvement fee and
shall only be for the improvement fee charged for the type of improvement being constructed.
12.3 If a qualified public improvement is located in whole or in part on or contiguous to the property
that is the subject of the development approval and is required to be built larger or with greater
capacity than is necessary for the particular development project, a credit shall be given for the
cost of the portion of the improvement that exceeds the city’s minimum standard facility size or
capacity needed to serve the particular development project or property. The applicant shall
have the burden of demonstrating that a particular improvement qualifies for credit under this
subsection. The request for credit shall be filed in writing no later than 60 days after acceptance
of the improvement by the city.
A. The city may deny the credit provided for in this section if the city demonstrates that the
application does not meet the requirements of this section or if the improvement for
which credit is sought was not included in the improvement plan pursuant to Section 8
of this ordinance.
12.4 When the construction of a qualified public improvement located in whole or in part or
contiguous to the property that is the subject of development approval gives rise to a credit
amount greater than the improvement fee that would otherwise be levied against the project, the
credit in excess of the improvement fee for the original development project may be applied
against improvement fees that accrue in subsequent phases of the original development project.
12.5 Notwithstanding Section 12.3 – 12.4, when establishing a methodology for a SDC, the city may
provide for a credit against the improvement fee, the reimbursement fee, or both, for capital
improvements constructed as part of the development which reduce the development’s demand
upon existing capital improvements and/or the need for future capital improvements, or a credit
based upon any other rationale the Council finds reasonable.
12.6 City Council shall have the right to grant a credit not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
applicable system development charge, for any development project submitted by a non-profit
corporation or any agency or subdivision of the federal, state, or local government. Only
development occurring upon property located with the city limits shall be eligible for this credit.
12.7 Credits shall not be transferable from one development to another.
12.8 Credits shall not be transferable from type of SDC to another.
12.9 Credits shall be used within 10 years from the date the credit is given.
12.10 Upon written request of City Manager, the Finance Director is authorized to cancel assessments
of system development charges, without further City Council action, where the new
9-26
8
development approved by a building permit is not constructed and the building permit is
cancelled.
Section 13. Notice.
13.1 The city shall maintain a list of persons who have made a written request for notification prior
to adoption or modification of a methodology for any SDC. Written notice shall be mailed to
persons on the list at least 90 days prior to the first hearing to establish or modify a SDC. The
methodology supporting the SDC shall be available at least 60 days prior to the first hearing to
adopt or amend a SDC. The failure of a person on the list to receive a notice that was mailed
does not invalidate the action of the city.
13.2 The city may periodically delete names from the list, but at least 30 days prior to removing a
name from the list, the city must notify the person whose name is to be deleted that a new
written request for notification is required if the person wishes to remain on the notification list.
Section 14. Segregation and Use of Revenue.
14.1 All funds derived from a particular type of SDC are to be segregated by accounting practices
from all funds of the city. That portion of the SDC calculated and collected on account of a
specific facility system shall be used for no purpose other than set forth in section 6 of this
ordinance.
14.2 The City Manager shall provide the city Council with an annual accounting, by January 1 of
each year, for SDCs showing the total amount of SDC revenues collected for each type of
facility and the projects funded from each account in the previous fiscal year. A list of the
amount spent on each project funded in whole or in part, with SDC revenues shall be included
in the annual accounting.
Section 15. Refunds.
15.1 Refunds may be given by the Administrator upon finding that there was a clerical error in the
calculation of the SDC.
15.2 Refunds shall not be allowed for failure to timely claim credit or for failure to timely seek an
alternative SDC rate calculation at the time of submission of an application for a building
permit.
15.3 The city shall refund to the applicant any SDC revenues not expended within ten (10) years of
receipt.
Section 16. Implementing Regulations; Amendments.
15.1 The city Council delegates authority to the City Manager to adopt necessary procedures to
implement provisions of this ordinance including the appointment of an SDC program
administrator. All rules pursuant to this delegated authority shall be filed with the office of the
City Manager and be available for public inspection.
Section 17. Appeal Procedure.

or the expenditure to the city Council by filing a written request with the City Manager
describing with particularity the decision and the expenditure from which the person appeals.

determines that there has been an improper expenditure of SDC revenues, the Council shall
direct that a sum equal to the misspent amount shall be deposited within one year to the credit of
the account or fund from which it was spent. The decision of the Council shall be reviewed only
as provided in ORS 34.010 to 34.100, and not otherwise.
17.4 A legal action challenging the methodology adopted by the Council pursuant to section 5 shall
not be filed later than 60 days after adoption. A person shall contest the methodology used for
calculating a SDC only as provided in ORS 34.010 to ORS 34.100, and not otherwise. A person
who wishes to challenge the calculation of a SDC must make a written challenge to the
calculation of the SDC and file the challenge with the City Manager within 10 days of receiving
the calculation. The written challenge must describe with particularity the calculation which the
person appeals.
A. The written challenge shall state:
1. The name and address of the appellant;
2. The nature of the calculation being appealed;
3. The reason the calculation is incorrect; and
4. What the correct determination of the appeal should be or how the correct
calculation should be derived. A person who fails to file such a written challenge
within the time permitted waives his/her objections, and his/her objections shall
be dismissed.
B. After providing timely notice to the challenger, the City Manager shall determine
whether the calculation is in accordance with the resolution containing the methodology
used to establish or modify the SDC adopted by the city Council.
C. Unless the challenger and the city agree to a longer period, a written challenge to the
calculation of the SDC shall be heard by the City Council within 30 working days of the
receipt of the written challenge. At least 10 working days prior to the hearing, the city
shall mail notice of the time and location thereof to the person who made the written
challenge.
D. City Council shall hear and determine the challenge on the basis of the person’s written
challenge and any additional evidence he/she deems appropriate. At the hearing the
challenger may present testimony and oral argument personally or by counsel. The rules
of evidence as used by courts of law do not apply.
E. The person challenging the calculation shall carry the burden of proving that the
calculation being appealed is incorrect and what the correct calculation should be or how
a correct calculation should be derived.
17.5 After exhausting the city’s administrative review procedure pursuant to section 17(5) of this

WHEREAS, the Grantor finds that the Grantee has substantially complied with the material
terms of the current Franchise under applicable laws, and that the financial, legal and technical ability of
the Grantee is sufficient to provide services, facilities and equipment necessary to meet the future

desires to enter into this Franchise with the Grantee for the construction and operation of a cable
system on the terms set forth herein; and
WHEREAS, the Cable Act requires a franchise for all entities, except the City, occupying or
using the public-rights-of-way to provide Cable Services, and

System and in the event of a determination of liability shall indemnify and hold Grantor, its officers,
boards, commissions, agents, and employees harmless from any and all liabilities, claims, demands, or
judgments growing out of any injury to any Person or property as a result of the negligence of Grantee
arising out of the construction, repair, extension, maintenance, operation or removal of its wires, poles
or other equipment of any kind or character used in connection with the operation of the Cable System,

area which is not contiguous to the present Service Area of the Grantee. Grantee need not make an
extension to any area which is financially or technically infeasible, if it provides documentation
substantiating such infeasibility to Grantor. Cable Service offered to Subscribers pursuant to this
Franchise shall be conditioned upon Grantee having legal access to any such Subscriber’s dwelling
unit or other units wherein such Cable Service is provided. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit
the Grantee’s ability to offer or provide bulk rate discounts or promotions.
6.2 Subscriber Charges for Extensions of the Cable System. No Subscriber shall be refused
service arbitrarily. However, if an area does not meet the density requirements of Section 6.1 above,
the Grantee shall only be required to extend the Cable System to Subscribers in that area if the
Subscribers are willing to share the capital costs of extending the Cable System. The Grantee may
require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential
Subscribers be paid in advance. Subscribers shall also be responsible for any standard/non-standard
installation charges to extend the Cable System from the tap to the residence. Grantee may require
residents who request service but whose residence is further than 125 feet from an existing feeder
cable to equally share the cost of an extension of service greater than the standard cost of a service
extension of 125 feet. Standard installation costs may also be required of such subscribers.
6.3 New Development Underground. In cases of new construction or property development
where utilities are to be placed underground, the Grantor agrees to require as a condition of issuing a
permit for open trenching to any developer or property owner that such developer or property owner
give Grantee at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of such construction or development, and of
the particular dates on which open trenching will be available for Grantee’s installation of conduit,
pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at Grantee’s expense. Grantee shall also provide
specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to
the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except that if Grantee fails to
install its conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals within five (5) working days of the date the
11-41
5
trenches are available, as designated in the written notice given by the developer or property owner,
then should the trenches be closed after the five day period, the cost of new trenching is to be borne by
Grantee.
6.4 Annexation. The Grantor shall promptly provide written notice to the Grantee of its annexation
of any territory which is being provided Cable Service by the Grantee or its affiliates. Such annexed
area will be subject to the provisions of this Franchise upon sixty (60) days ‘written notice from the
Grantor, subject to the conditions set forth below and Section 6.1 above. The Grantor shall also notify
Grantee in writing of all new street address assignments or changes within the Service Area. Grantee
shall within ninety (90) days after receipt of the annexation notice, pay the Grantor franchise fees on
revenue received from the operation of the Cable System to provide Cable Services in any area
annexed by the Grantor if the Grantor has provided a written annexation notice that includes the
addresses that will be moved into the Service Area in an Excel format or in a format that will allow
Grantee to change its billing system. If the annexation notice does not include the addresses that will
be moved into the Service Area, Grantee shall pay franchise fees within ninety (90) days after it
receives the annexed addresses as set forth above. All notices due under this section shall be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested to the addresses set forth in Section 14.5 with a copy to the
Director of Government Relations. In any audit of franchise fees due under this Franchise, Grantee
shall not be liable for franchise fees on annexed areas unless and until Grantee has received
notification and information that meets the standards set forth in this section.

those Service Areas where existing telephone and electric services are both underground at the time of
system construction. In areas where either telephone or electric utility facilities are installed aerially at
the time of system construction, the Grantee may install its facilities aerially with the understanding that
at such time as the existing aerial facilities are required to be placed underground by the Grantor, the
Grantee shall likewise place its facilities underground. In the event that any telephone or electric
utilities are reimbursed by the Grantor or any agency thereof for the placement of cable underground or
the movement of cable, Grantee shall be reimbursed upon the same terms and conditions as any
telephone, electric or other utilities.
8.3 Construction Codes and Permits. Grantee shall obtain all legally required permits before
commencing any work requiring a permit, including the opening or disturbance of any Street within the
Service Area. The Grantor shall cooperate with the Grantee in granting any permits required, providing
such grant and subsequent construction by the Grantee shall not unduly interfere with the use of such
Streets. The Grantee shall adhere to all building and zoning codes currently or hereafter applicable to
construction, operation or maintenance of the Cable System in the Service Area, provided that such
codes are of general applicability and such codes are uniformly and consistently applied by the Grantor
as to other public utility companies and other entities operating in the Service Area.

in good order and repair. The Grantee shall, at all times, employ ordinary care and use commonly
accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage,

disturbance caused to the public way as a result of its operation, construction, or maintenance of the
Cable System to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition of the Streets immediately prior to
such damage or disturbance.
8.6 Removal in Emergency. Whenever, in case of fire or other disaster, it becomes necessary in
the judgment of the Grantor to remove any of the Grantee’s facilities, no charge shall be made by the
Grantee against the Grantor for restoration and repair, unless such acts amount to gross negligence by
the Grantor.
8.7 Tree Trimming. Grantee or its designee shall have the authority to trim trees on public property
at its own expense as may be necessary to protect its wires and facilities.
8.8 Relocation for the Grantor. The Grantee shall, upon receipt of reasonable advance written
notice, to be not less than ten (10) business days, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or
remove any property of Grantee when lawfully required by the Grantor. Grantee shall be responsible for
any costs associated with these obligations to the same extent all other users of the Grantor rights-ofway
are responsible for the costs related to the relocation of their facilities.
8.9 Relocation for a Third Party. The Grantee shall, on the request of any Person holding a lawful
permit issued by the Grantor, protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or
remove from the Street as necessary any property of the Grantee, provided that the expense of such is
11-41
7
paid by any such Person benefiting from the relocation and the Grantee is given reasonable advance
written notice to prepare for such changes. The Grantee may require such payment in advance. For
purposes of this subsection, “reasonable advance written notice” shall be no less than ten (10)
business days in the event of a temporary relocation and no less than one hundred twenty (120) days
for a permanent relocation.
8.10 Reimbursement of Costs. If funds are available to any Person using the Streets for the
purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the Grantor shall reimburse the Grantee in the
same manner in which other Persons affected by the requirement are reimbursed. If the funds are
controlled by another governmental entity, the Grantor shall make application for such funds on behalf
of the Grantee.
8.11 Emergency Use. If the Grantee provides an Emergency Alert System (“EAS”), then the
Grantor shall permit only appropriately trained and authorized Persons to operate the EAS equipment
and shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the Grantee’s Cable System in any
manner that results in inappropriate use thereof, or any loss or damage to the Cable System. The

arising out of use of the EAS, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

substantive service changes.
9.3 Rate Regulation. Grantor shall have the right to exercise rate regulation to the extent
authorized by law, or to refrain from exercising such regulation for any period of time, at the sole
discretion of the Grantor. If and when exercising rate regulation, the Grantor shall abide by the terms
and conditions set forth by the FCC.
9.4 Continuity of Service. It shall be the right of all Subscribers to continue receiving Cable
Service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the Grantee are satisfied. However,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Grantee may discontinue or refuse to provide Cable Service
to any person that is abusive and/or exhibits threatening behavior toward the Grantee’s employees or

System that results in the inappropriate use thereof or any loss or damage to the Cable System. The

Effective Date of the Franchise as set forth in Section 14.11. In the event of a dispute, the Grantor, if it
so requests, shall be furnished a statement of said payment, reflecting the Gross Revenues and the
applicable charges.
10.3 Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance of any payment by the Grantor shall be construed as
a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the Grantor may have for additional sums
payable as a franchise fee under this Franchise.
10.4 Limitation on Recovery. The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable
hereunder shall be three (3) years from the date on which payment by the Grantee was due. If any
Franchise payment or recomputed payment is not made on or before the dates specified herein,
Grantee shall pay an interest charge, computed from the last day of the fiscal year in which payment
was due, at the annual rate of one (1%) percent over the prime interest rate.
Section 11: Transfer of Franchise.
11.1 Franchise Transfer. The Franchise granted hereunder shall not be assigned, other than by
operation of law or to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Grantee,
without the prior consent of the Grantor, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No
such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or
by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the Grantee in the Franchise or Cable System to secure
indebtedness. Within thirty (30) days of receiving a request for transfer, the Grantor shall notify the
Grantee in writing of any additional information it reasonably requires to determine the legal, financial
and technical qualifications of the transferee. If the Grantor has not taken action on the Grantee’s
request for transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days after receiving such request, consent by the
Grantor shall be deemed given.
Section 12: Records, Reports and Maps.
12.1 Reports Required. The Grantee’s schedule of charges for regular Subscriber service, its policy
regarding the processing of Subscriber complaints, delinquent Subscriber disconnect and reconnect
procedures and any other terms and conditions adopted as the Grantee’s policy in connection with its
Subscribers shall be filed with the Grantor upon request.
12.2 Records Required.
The Grantee shall at all times maintain:
A. A record of all written complaints received regarding interruptions or degradation of
Cable Service, which record shall be maintained for one (1) year.

Grantor, upon receipt of advance written notice, to examine at Grantee’s local office or another mutually
agreeable location during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis any and all of Grantee’s
records maintained by Grantee as is reasonably necessary to ensure Grantee’s compliance with the
Franchise. Such notice shall specifically reference the subsection of the Franchise that is under review
so that the Grantee may organize the necessary books and records for easy access by the Grantor.
The Grantee shall not be required to maintain any books and records for Franchise compliance
purposes longer than three (3) years, except for service complaints, which shall be kept for one (1) year
as specified above. The Grantee shall not be required to provide Subscriber information in violation of
Section 631 of the Cable Act. The Grantor agrees to treat as confidential any books, records or maps
that constitute proprietary or confidential information to the extent Grantee makes the Grantor aware of
such confidentiality. If the Grantor believes it must release any such confidential books or records in
the course of enforcing this Franchise, or for any other reason, it shall advise Grantee in advance so
that Grantee may take appropriate steps to protect its interests. Until otherwise ordered by a court or
agency of competent jurisdiction, the Grantor agrees that, to the extent permitted by State and federal
law, it shall deny access to any of Grantee’s books and records marked confidential, as set forth above,
to any Person.
Section 13: Enforcement or Revocation.
13.1 Notice of Violation. If the Grantor believes that the Grantee has not complied with the terms of
the Franchise, the Grantor shall first make reasonable attempts to informally discuss the matter with
Grantee. If these discussions do not lead to resolution of the problem, the Grantor shall notify the
Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance (the “Violation Notice”).
13.2 Grantee’s Right to Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of
the Violation Notice to (i) respond to the Grantor, contesting the assertion of noncompliance, or (ii) to
cure such default, or (iii) if, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty (30)
day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the Grantor of the steps being
taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
13.3 Public Hearing. If the Grantee fails to respond to the Violation Notice received from the
Grantor, or if the default is not remedied within the cure period set forth above, the Board shall
schedule a public hearing if it intends to continue its investigation into the default. The Grantor shall
provide the Grantee at least twenty (20) days prior written notice of such hearing, which specifies the
time, place and purpose of such hearing, notice of which shall be published by the Clerk of the Grantor
in a newspaper of general circulation within the Grantor in accordance with Section 14 hereof. The
Grantee shall have the right to present evidence and to question witnesses. The Grantor shall
determine if the Grantee has committed a violation and shall make written findings of fact relative to its
determination. If a violation is found, the Grantee may petition for reconsideration before any
competent tribunal having jurisdiction over such matters.
13.4 Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and State law, in the event the Grantor, after the
hearing set forth in subsection 13.3 above, determines that the Grantee is in default of any provision of
the Franchise, the Grantor may:
A. Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such
remedy, as an alternative to damages; or
11-41
10
B. Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief;
or
C. In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the Franchise, seek
to revoke the Franchise itself in accordance with subsection 13.5 below.
13.5 Revocation.
A. Prior to revocation or termination of the Franchise, the Grantor shall give written notice
to the Grantee of its intent to revoke the Franchise on the basis of a pattern of noncompliance
by the Grantee, including one or more instances of substantial noncompliance with a material
provision of the Franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance.
The Grantee shall have sixty (60) days from such notice to either object in writing and to state
its reasons for such objection and provide any explanation or to cure the alleged
noncompliance. If the Grantor has not received a satisfactory response from Grantee, it may
then seek to revoke the Franchise at a public hearing. The Grantee shall be given at least thirty
(30) days prior written notice of such public hearing, specifying the time and place of such
hearing and stating its intent to revoke the Franchise.
B. At the hearing, the Board shall give the Grantee an opportunity to state its position on
the matter, present evidence and question witnesses, after which it shall determine whether or
not the Franchise shall be revoked. The public hearing shall be on the record and a written
transcript shall be made available to the Grantee within ten (10) business days. The decision of
the Board shall be made in writing and shall be delivered to the Grantee. The Grantee may
appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the
decision of the Board de novo. The Grantee may continue to operate the Cable System until all
legal appeals procedures have been exhausted.
C. Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Grantee does not waive any of its rights under
federal law or regulation.
D. Upon revocation of the Franchise, Grantee may remove the Cable System from the
Streets of the Grantor, or abandon the Cable System in place.
Section 14: Miscellaneous Provisions.
14.1 Force Majeure. The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with the
provisions of the Franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default,
where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably
beyond the ability of the Grantee to anticipate and control. This provision includes, but is not limited to,
severe or unusual weather conditions, fire, flood, or other acts of God, strikes, work delays caused by
failure of utility providers to service, maintain or monitor their utility poles to which Grantee’s Cable
System is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work
necessary.
14.2 Minor Violations. Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the Grantor’s intention to
subject the Grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the Franchise for violations of the
Franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on
the Subscribers within the Service Area, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties
and hardship to the Grantee which outweighs the benefit to be derived by the Grantor and/or
Subscribers.
11-41
11
14.3 Action of Parties. In any action by the Grantor or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted
under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely manner.
Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such
approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
14.4 Equal Protection. The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the Grantor may be required
by federal law, and reserves the right, to grant one or more additional franchises to provide Cable
Service within the Service Area. If any other provider of Cable Services or video services (without
regard to the technology used to deliver such services) is lawfully and expressly authorized by the
Grantor to use the Streets to provide such services, and if the material obligations applicable to
Grantee are more burdensome or less favorable than those imposed on any such competing provider
(such determination to be made after good faith negotiations between Grantee and Grantor), then upon
thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Grantor, the Grantee shall have the right to elect, to the extent
consistent with applicable state and federal laws and orders and rules adopted pursuant thereto:
A. to modify this Franchise to incorporate less burdensome or more favorable terms or conditions
imposed by Grantor on a comparable provider; or
B. to deem this Franchise expired thirty-six (36) months from the date of the above written notice;
or
C. to terminate this Franchise and take in its place the same franchise agreement of a competing
provider of Cable Services or video services authorized by the Grantor.
The Grantor and the Grantee agree that any undertakings that relate to the renewal of the
Grantee’s Franchise with the Grantor shall be subject to the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act
or any such successor statute. Nothing in this Franchise shall impair the right of the Grantor or Grantee
to seek other remedies available under law.
14.5 Notices. Unless otherwise provided by federal, State or local law, all notices, reports or
demands pursuant to this Franchise shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be sufficiently given
upon delivery to a Person at the address set forth below, or by U.S. certified mail, return receipt
requested, nationally or internationally recognized courier service such as Federal Express or electronic
mail communication to the designated electronic mail address provided below. Grantee shall provide
thirty (30) days’ written notice of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions
using any reasonable written means. As set forth above, notice served upon the Grantor shall be
