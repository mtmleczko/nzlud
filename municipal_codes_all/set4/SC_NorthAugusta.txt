PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of North Augusta, South Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code was the 1980 Code, as supplemented through October, 2010, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supercedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole are included herein. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the city, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes are not included herein. For an enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross-references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Sec. 1-4. - Effect of repeal or expiration of ordinance. 
    The repeal of an ordinance, or its expiration by virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued, any offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred or any proceeding commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.

Sec. 1-6. - Amendments to Code. 
    All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code of Ordinances, which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code of Ordinances, may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion therein, or in the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby and the subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code of Ordinances and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code of Ordinances by the city. 
    Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: 
    "That Section _____ of the Code of Ordinances, City of North Augusta, South Carolina, is hereby amended to read as follows: ...." The new provisions shall then be set out in full as enacted. 
    In the event a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language may be used: 
    "That the Code of Ordinances, City of North Augusta, South Carolina, is hereby amended by adding a section, to be numbered _____, which section reads as follows: ...." The new section shall then be set out in full as enacted. 
    In lieu of the foregoing paragraph, when the council desires to enact an ordinance of a general and permanent nature embracing a subject not previously existing in the Code, but which said governing authority desires to incorporate into the Code, a provision in substantially the following language may be made a part of the ordinance: "It is the intention of the Mayor and Council, in council duly assembled, and it is hereby ordained, that the provisions of this ordinance shall become and be made part of the Code of Ordinances, City of North Augusta, South Carolina, and the sections of this ordinance may be renumbered to accomplish such intention."

Cross reference- Finances, purchases, § 2-130 et seq. 

Sec. 2-10. - Revenue policy. 
    The City of North Augusta will try to maintain a diversified and stable revenue system to shelter it from short-run fluctuations in any one revenue source. 
    The city will project revenues for the next three (3) years and will update the projection annually, examining each existing and potential revenue source. 
    The city will set user fees and user charges for water, sewer, sanitation, and outside fire protection at a level that fully supports the total direct cost including equipment replacement and indirect cost (except depreciation) of the activity. 
    The city will set fees for other user activities, including recreational programs, at a level to support the direct cost of the activity. 
    Nonresidents who use city facilities or participate in programs offered by the city, such as recreational programs, may pay for these services at a higher rate than city residents. This increased rate is to partially offset taxes paid by City residents that are used to support the indirect costs of these programs. 
(Res. No. 87-14, 7-6-87) 
Sec. 2-11. - Operating budget policy. 
    The City of North Augusta will adopt a budget each year for the general fund and the enterprise fund on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles except that depreciation in the enterprise fund is not required to be budgeted. The city will adopt a budget each year for the special revenue funds and capital projects fund on a project or activity basis which may exclude prior fiscal year appropriations flowing through as current year expenditures. 
    The city will pay for all current expenditures or expenses with current revenues. The audited unreserved fund balance in the general fund at year-end shall be transferred to the capital projects fund on an annual basis to be used in accordance with the adopted capital projects fund policy. 
    The transfer of budgeted amounts between functional areas of expenditures or expenses shall be approved by city council; however, transfers of budgeted line items within the functional areas of expenditures or expenses not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) may be approved by the city administrator as long as total expenditures or expenses do not exceed appropriations in the functional area. Functional areas are: general government; public safety; public works; recreation and parks; and public utilities. 
    Unexpended appropriations lapse at year-end except that whole or part of appropriations provided in the budget for capital or betterment outlays of the special revenue funds or capital projects fund remaining unexpended at the close of the fiscal year are held available for the following year. 
    The city will avoid budgetary procedures that balance current expenditures or expenses at the expense of meeting future years' expenditures or expenses, such as postponing expenditures or expenses or accruing future years' revenues. 
    The budget will provide for adequate maintenance of capital plant and equipment. The budget will include estimated operating costs of future capital improvements that are anticipated to be operational during the budget year. 
    In an effort to maintain a budgetary control system to help adherence to the budget, the city administrator will provide monthly financial reports to city council. 
    Each year the city will update operating expenditure or expense projections for the next three (3) years. Projections will include estimated operating costs of future capital improvements that are included in the capital budget. 
    Where possible, the city will integrate performance measurement and productivity indicators.

    The city will analyze market conditions and, when practical, obtain bids on cash available for investment. In an effort to keep investments in our community, the city will require that nonresident bidders offer a yield of twenty-five one hundredths (0.25) per cent higher to receive the investment. 
    The city will invest as much of its idle cash as practicable on a continuous basis. 
    The city will pool cash from several different funds for investment purposes, provided that the interest earned shall be prorated based on principal invested back to the respective fund. 
    All investments made by the city will be selected and properly secured in accordance with State law. 
    The accounting system will provide regular information concerning cash position and investment performance. 
(Res. No. 87-14, 7-6-87) 
Sec. 2-13. - Accounting, financial reporting and reserve policy. 
    The city will establish and maintain its accounting records to conform to generally accepted accounting principles and standards. 
    Monthly financial reports summarizing financial activities by major fund types will be prepared and submitted to city council. In addition, the city will prepare and publish a comprehensive annual financial report for distribution to city council and other interested parties. This report will conform to the standards outlined in the government finance officer's association certificate of achievement for excellence in financial reporting program. 
    Where possible, the reporting system of the city will provide information on the total cost of specific services by type of expenditure or expense and, if necessary, by project or fund. 
    Reserves are recorded to signify that a portion of the fund equity is separated for future use and is not available for appropriation or normal expenditure or expense. 
(1)  General fund. The city shall maintain a reserve for the general government function of eight hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($825,000.00) or fifteen (15) per cent of the then current general fund budget to the nearest twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), whichever is greater, and it shall be entitled, "reserve designated for contingencies." Beginning with fiscal year 2004, this reserve shall be increased by one (1) per cent each year of the then current general fund budget to the nearest twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) whichever is greater, until the total per cent is fifteen (15) per cent of the then current general fund budget. 
(2)  Stormwater utility fund.

(Res. No. 87-14, 7-6-87; Ord. No. 93-13, § I, 6-21-93; Ord. No. 96-14, § 1, 11-18-96; Ord. No. 04-25, § I, 11-15-04) 
Sec. 2-14. - Capital projects fund policy. 
    The City of North Augusta will make all capital improvements in accordance with an adopted capital projects fund program. 
    The city will develop a multi-year plan for the capital projects fund and update it annually. 
    The city will enact an annual capital projects fund budget based on the multi-year capital projects fund plan. Future capital expenditures necessitated by changes in population, changes in real estate development, or changes in economic base will be calculated and included in capital budget projections. 
    Revenue sources to fund the capital improvements program may include the following: 
(1)  The audited general fund unreserved fund balance. 
(2)  A designated tax millage for the capital projects fund program. 
(3)  Intergovernmental assistance. 
(4)  Interest earnings of the capital projects fund. 
    The city will coordinate development of the capital projects fund budget with the development of the operating budget. Future operating costs associated with new capital projects will be projected and included in the operating budget forecasts. 
    The city will maintain all its assets at a level adequate to protect the city's capital investment and to minimize future maintenance and replacement costs. 
    The city administrator will identify the estimated costs and potential funding sources for each capital project proposal before it is submitted to city council for approval. The city will determine the least costly financing method for all new projects. 
    The city will use intergovernmental assistance to finance only those capital projects that are consistent with the capital projects fund program and city priorities. 
(Res. No. 87-14, 7-6-87) 
Sec. 2-14.1. - Fund balance. 
    The North Augusta City Council recognizes that the maintenance of a fund balance is essential to the preservation of the financial integrity of the City of North Augusta and is fiscally advantageous for both the city and its taxpayers. Fund balance is a measurement of available financial resources and is the difference between total assets and total liabilities in each fund. This policy provides guidance concerning the fund balance maintained by the city to mitigate financial risk that can occur from unforeseen revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures, and similar circumstances. The city also seeks to maintain the highest possible credit ratings which are dependent, in part, on the city's maintenance of an adequate fund balance. 
    Beginning with the most restrictive constraints, fund balance amounts will be reported in the following categories: 
(1)  Non-spendable fund balance - amounts that are not in a spendable form (e.g., inventory) or are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact (e.g., permanent fund principal). 
(2)  Restricted fund balance - amounts that can be spent only for the specific purposes stipulated by external parties either constitutionally or through enabling legislation (e.g., grants or donations). 
(3)  Committed fund balance - amounts that can be used only for the specific purposes determined by formal action of the North Augusta City Council. Commitments may be changed or lifted only by referring to the formal action that imposed the constraint originally (e.g., the City of North Augusta's commitment in connection with future construction projects). 
(4)  Assigned fund balance - amounts intended to be used by the City of North Augusta for specific purposes. Intent can be expressed by the North Augusta City Council. In government funds other than the general fund, assigned fund balance represents the amount that is not restricted or committed. This indicates that resources in other governmental funds are, at a minimum, intended to be used for the purpose of that fund. 
(5)  Unassigned fund balance - includes all amounts not contained in other classifications and is the residual classification of the general fund only. Unassigned amounts are available for any legal purpose. 
    The responsibility for designating funds to specific classifications shall be as follows: 
Committed fund balance - The North Augusta City Council is the highest level of decision-making authority, and formal action by city council must be taken to establish, modify, or rescind a fund balance commitment. 
Assigned fund balance - The North Augusta City Council has authorized the city administrator as the official authorized to assign the fund balance to a specific purpose as approved by this fund balance policy.

Editor's note- Resolution No. 87-32, adopted Nov. 2, 1987, amended Div. 3 in its entirety to read as set out herein. Prior to amendment, Div. 3 contained § 2-15-2-19, pertaining to similar provisions and deriving from Res. No. R-81-03, adopted Jan. 20, 1981. 

Sec. 2-15. - Purposes. 
    The City of North Augusta hereby adopts the following policies for purposes of encouraging quality development within its corporate limits and orderly growth resulting from the extension of its corporate limits. 
(Res. No. 87-32, 11-2-87) 
Sec. 2-16. - Water and sewer extension policy. 
    The water and sewer extension policy shall begin with adopted master plans (updated periodically) for the water and sewer systems. The master plans must include specific line location and specific sizes to maintain good system integrity. When a request for water or sewer service is received from a potential developer, the master plans as adopted by the mayor and council become the first instrument used by staff to evaluate the request. 
    If the requested extension is a part of the master plans, the decision for extension is made based on the funds available for implementation of the master plans. In setting priorities for allocating money for this implementation, the realities of development will play an important role. Tap fees and user surcharges may be used to calculate a pay-back on the investment. 
    If the requested extension is not a part of the water or sewer master plans, the city's engineering division shall review the request to determine the effect of the extension on the water distribution or sewer collection systems and ultimately on the master plans. If it is determined that the proposed line would serve a greater purpose than simply serving the proposed development, the master plans may be amended to include proposed extension. Implementation would then follow as previously presented. 
    Should the extension be determined to have no effect on the master plans, the responsibility for the extension could rest primarily with the developer. However, various pay-back methods which would include financing, special tap fees, user surcharges, and annexation efforts would be more available to encourage the development. 
    The ability and willingness to annex will be an important factor when discussing water or sewer extension with a developer. In return for city services, the following conditions shall apply: 
(1)  For property with annexation legally possible, annexation shall be immediate with development to comply with city requirements such as planning commission review and building permits. 
(2)  For property with annexation not legally possible, city subdivision regulations, building codes, and permits shall apply with enforcement privileges by contractual agreement with the county. During the period of time prior to annexation, all outside rates shall apply.

It shall be the desire of the city to adopt and enforce these codes necessitated by the health, safety, and well being of its present and future citizens. Enforcement of these codes shall be evenhanded and with a goal of working with and not against those parties involved.

DIVISION 4. - GRANTS ACCOUNTING POLICY 

Sec. 2-19. - Grants accounting policy. 
    The City of North Augusta will pursue grants from all levels of government when it is in the best interest of the city. All grants received by the city, either direct with the city as the recipient or indirectly with the city as a sub-recipient, shall be accounted for properly. 
    In order to insure that all city grants from federal agencies are properly reported on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Award, the following steps will be taken: 
(1)  The finance department will develop the property identifying revenue and expenditure accounts for each grant. 
(2)  The city department receiving the grant is solely responsible for monitoring the grants and complying with all grant requirements. Request for reimbursement of grant proceeds will be filed at least quarterly and more frequently if required by the grantor. Copies of the reimbursement request will be provided to the finance department at the same time as the request for reimbursement is submitted to the grantor. 
(3)  For accounting and reporting proposes, a grant is considered active from its effective date until all advances/reimbursements are received, all expenditures have been made, all grant requirements have been satisfied, and all required audits are complete. A grant may be considered active even though there are no financial transactions during the fiscal year. 
(4)  The grant will not be closed until the department responsible for the grant notifies the finance department to close all accounts associated with the grant.

This authority can be exercised by the city administrator for purchases/contracts of an amount less than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) without formal council approval.

Sec. 6-40. - Water system. 
(a)  The water system shall be considered as made up of two (2) parts: the utility system and the customer system. 
(b)  The utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system, and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where the customer's system begins. 
(c)  The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution system. 
(d)  The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system. 
(e)  The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the utility distribution system that are utilized in conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use. 
(Ord. No. 98-01, § I, 2-2-98; Ord. No. 01-11, § I, 9-17-01) 
Sec. 6-41. - Policy. 
(a)  No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state/federal laws and regulations and this article. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow-prevention assembly required by this article is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow-prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. 
(b)  The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the director of public utilities shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state/federal and city statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
(c)  An approved backflow-prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist: 
(1)  In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not acceptable as an additional source by the director of public utilities, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. 
(2)  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
(3)  In the case of premises having (1) internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line. 
(d)  The type of protective assembly required under subsections (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows: 
(1)  In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection (c)(1) of this section and is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly. 
(2)  In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly. 
(3)  In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants. 
(4)  In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly at the service connection. 
(5)  In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly on each service to the premises. 
(6)  In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the director of public utilities, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the director may require an air gap at the service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the director and is dependent on the degree of hazard. 
(e)  Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the director of public utilities. The term approved backflow-prevention assembly shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association titled, AWWA C510-89-Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow-Prevention Assembly, and AWWA C511-89-Standard for Reduced-Pressure Principle Backflow-Prevention Assembly, and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California established by "Specification of Backflow-Prevention Assemblies," Section 10 of the most current issue of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control. 
    Said AWWA and FCCHR standards and specifications have been adopted by the city. Final approval shall be evidenced by a compliance with said AWWA standards and FCCHR specifications. 
    The following testing laboratory has been qualified by the director of public utilities to test and certify backflow preventers: 
Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research 
University of Southern California 
University Park 
Los Angeles, CA 90089 
    Testing laboratories, other than the laboratory listed above, will be added to an approved list as they are qualified by the director. 
    Backflow preventers that may be subjected to backpressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by said qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory's current list of approved backflow-prevention assemblies may be used without further testing or qualification. 
(f)  It shall be the duty of the customer/user at any premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the director of public utilities deems the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly manufacturer's representative, or by a certified tester approved by the director. It shall be the duty of the director to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer/user shall notify the director in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the customer/user may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer/user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the director. 
(g)  All presently installed backflow-prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection (f), be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the director of public utilities is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the director finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.

ARTICLE IV. - SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES AND PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT 

Sec. 12-22. - Findings and determinations. 
    The city council (the "council") of the City of North Augusta, South Carolina, hereby finds and determines: 
(a)  The City of North Augusta, South Carolina (the "city"), is an incorporated municipality located in Aiken and Edgefield Counties, South Carolina, and as such possesses all powers granted to municipalities by the Constitution and the laws of the State of South Carolina, including the powers enumerated in S.C. Code § 5-7-30 (2005 Supp) relating to regulating streets, markets, and public health. 
(b)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute has determined that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to sixty-five thousand (65,000) Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10, "Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.). The Surgeon General has declared that: 
(1)  Secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in nonsmokers exposed to smoke; 
(2)  Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for sudden death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more severe asthma; 
(3)  Adults exposed to secondary smoke have a higher risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer; 
(4)  There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and 
(5)  Separating smoking and nonsmoking sections of indoor areas does not sufficiently remove the threats of secondhand smoke in enclosed areas. 
(c)  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) per cent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
(d)  Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business and Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(e)  Certain outdoor events, such as parades, festivals, and other public gatherings, result in nonsmokers finding themselves in close proximity to persons who are smoking which can be reasonably seen to have the same effects of exposure as when nonsmokers are exposed to smoke in the same enclosed space. Lighted cigarettes, cigars, and pipes of people standing or sitting in close proximity have the potential of burning those with whom they inadvertently come into direct contact and making the air quality and peaceful enjoyment of outdoor events unreasonably restricted for nonsmokers. 
(f)  When there is a presence of secondhand smoke in enclosed spaces or in outside areas where there is a public gathering resulting in people being in close proximity in places that are otherwise open to the public at large inevitably results in persons who do not smoke being forced to bear unwarranted health risks and inappropriate deprivation of peaceful enjoyment of the premises to which they have been invited or permitted to enter, even when steps have been taken to separate "smoking" and "nonsmoking" areas within the confined space. 
(g)  The city recognizes that smoke creates a danger to the health and safety of the public at large and that, in order to protect the health and welfare of the public, it is necessary to restrict smoking in the manner provided for in this article (the "article").

All such bills shall be taken as having been rendered when placed in the United States mail. Failure to receive such a bill in no way relieves any customer from paying for utility services rendered. Such bills shall be due and payable within twenty-five (25) days from the billing date, at which time, if the bill is unpaid, a four-dollar ($4.00) late charge shall be added to the utility bill. 
(c)  Failure to pay for any utility charges by the thirtieth day following the billing date may result in termination of the customer's utility service. Termination of the customer's utility service may result in applying so much of the customer's utility deposit as necessary to satisfy the past-due bill. In such case, no utility service may be reconnected until the deposit has been brought back up to the full amount of the current deposit. A service charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) during normal working hours and thirty dollars ($30.00) after normal working hours for each discontinuance shall be paid prior to service being restored. In cases where the meter has been removed as a result of a meter tampering/theft of water, a meter reset fee of one-hundred and twenty dollars ($120.00) shall be paid prior to service being restored. 
    Note: The service charge shall be thirty dollars ($30.00) for any discontinuance that involves the restoring of service after normal working hours for the city.

DIVISION 1. - CONNECTIONS, PERMITS, FEES 

Sec. 14-40. - Properties required to be connected to city sanitary sewer. 
    It shall be the duty of every owner of occupied real estate adjoining any street, right-of-way or easement provided with a sewer or whose property is within three hundred (300) feet of any street, right-of-way or easement provided with a sewer to make proper connection with such sewer within six (6) months after such sewer has been accepted by the city, and to supply suitable fixtures to accommodate the number of people residing in, using, or employed on such premises. 
    For existing occupied real estate, sanitary sewer service is determined to be available when a minimum slope of one-eighth ( 1/8 ) inch per foot can be maintained between the invert of the gravity sewer main and one foot below the elevation of the finished floor. In addition, the finished floor must be a minimum of three (3) feet above the invert of the sanitary sewer main. 
    For new structures, sanitary sewer service is determined to be available in all cases where a gravity sanitary sewer is available within three hundred (300) feet of the property to be served, regardless of the elevation of the structure in relation to the sewer main. If the minimum grade above cannot be maintained, individual lift stations shall be required. 
    If any such owner shall fail or neglect to comply with the foregoing provisions within such time limit, the city shall give notice in writing to such owner, or to such person's agent or tenant, that such connection must be made and such fixtures provided within twenty (20) days. 
    Any owner, agent or tenant who shall willfully fail or neglect to make such connections with the sewer, and to provide such fixtures within the time specified in such notice, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Every day of twenty-four (24) hours duration after the time limit set in such notice shall be deemed a separate violation of this section. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-41. - Connections with main sewer; type, grade. 
    Every house and building shall be separately and independently connected with the main sewer. Service connections with main sewer lines must be made by means of a "Y" connection or an approved collar fitting. Service connections shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than one-eighth ( 1/8 ) inch to each foot. The finished floor of all occupied buildings must be a minimum of three (3) feet above the invert of the sanitary sewer. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-42. - Permit, inspection of plumbing, etc. 
    A permit issued by the city shall be required prior to any person making a connection to the public sewer. Permits to connect with the sewer system of the city will be issued only when the plumbing 
in the building to be connected is in accordance with the rules for plumbing set forth in Chapter 6 of the Code and has been inspected and found so by the city, or in case of a new building, when a proper plan for the plumbing has been approved by the city. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-43. - Interfering or tampering with sewer system. 
    No unauthorized person shall turn, remove, raise, or in any manner interfere or tamper with the cover of any manhole or other appurtenance connected with any public sewer.

(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-44. - Wastewater tap and extension fees. 
    For each new connection to the city's wastewater system, the person applying for service shall pay a base tap fee and/or a wastewater extension fee. Such fee(s) shall be made prior to the installation of the connection. 
(a)  Base tap fee. The purpose of a base tap fee is to allow the city to partially recoup costs associated with the provision of wastewater trunk, secondary trunk lines, or pumping stations which have been installed or upgraded by the city to serve drainage areas. 
(1)  For those connections in which there is an existing tap (service line from main line to property line), the base tap fee shall be six hundred fifty dollars ($650.00) for inside city customers and thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300.00) for outside customers, unless a pavement cut, service line or bore is required. 
(2)  For those connections in which there is a pavement cut, a bore, no service line, or for those connections in which the wastewater line must be extended to the tap location, the base tap fee shall be six hundred fifty dollars ($650.00) plus costs for inside city customers and thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300.00) plus costs for outside city customers. 
(3)  The above tap fees shall apply without regard to who installed the sewer collection system or taps. 
(b)  Sewer extension fees. When the sanitary sewer trunk and/or collection lines have been extended to serve a given area under the guidelines of the adopted "Growth Policies" of the city, and when no other contractual arrangements have been made by the city, sewer extension fees shall be established based upon the costs to the city for the extension. 
    The sanitary sewer extension fee shall be on a per-dwelling unit, commercial unit, or acre-served basis and shall be in addition to the base tap fee as established in (a)(1) and (2) above. The cost of a sewer extension fee and the time of payment shall be determined at the time of the extension. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89; Ord. No. 90-09, § 1, 7-16-90; Ord. No. 04-27, § I, 11-15-04) 
Sec. 14-45. - Septic tanks-Generally. 
    In the event that public sanitary sewer services are not available within three hundred (300) feet of the lot or land in question and the city is unable and/or unwilling to extend the sanitary sewer system through its utility extension policies, septic tanks may be installed, provided a permit has first been obtained from the city. Prior to the city's issuing a septic tank permit, a permit from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control must be furnished to the city. Upon completion of the septic tank, a certificate of approval as issued by the state must be furnished to the city.

c.  Unusual volume of flow or concentrations of wastes constituting slugs as defined herein. 
(10)  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment process employed or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-51. - Action of city upon undesirable wastewater. 
    If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in section 14-50, which in the judgment of the city may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving water, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city may: 
(1)  Reject wastes; 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition with discharge to the public sewers; 
(3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
(4)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges. 
    If the city permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the city subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89)

    It shall be required by the city that the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes install a suitable control manhole. When deemed necessary, the city may require additional meters and other appurtenance in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the waste. Such manhole shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner's expense and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-55. - Procedures for measurements, tests, and analyses. 
    All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this ordinance shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Waste Water," published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. In order for the city to properly evaluate the effect of the waste on the system, an industry must submit, along with the plans for said system as required by the public works engineer, an industrial waste questionnaire form available from the city. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-56. - Surge tank required. 
    An industry, the hydraulic load of which is ten (10) per cent or more of the total hydraulic load to the system, must provide pretreatment in the form of a surge tank to equalize the flow over a seven-day period. The surge tank must be approved by the city. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-57. - Surcharges. 
    A schedule of surcharges has been established by resolution which takes into consideration the total costs for the treatment of waste. In the schedule, a BOD concentration of zero (0) to six hundred (600) ppm and a pH in the range of 6.0 through 11.0 pH units is considered to be standard sewage waste. Any sewage having a concentration in excess of six hundred (600) ppm BOD, or having a pH of less than 6.0 units or greater than 11.0 units is subject to a surcharge in accordance with the schedule set forth in the resolution. This surcharge schedule is based on the equitable recovery of waste treatment costs as required for those cities receiving federal assistance for the construction of wastewater treatment facilities and is in compliance with the regulations 40 CFR 35.935-13. The issuance of this surcharge schedule does not in itself permit nor does it imply that any such waste will be received by the city for treatment. In each instance, the actual acceptance of the waste for treatment is subject to review and evaluation by the city. In some instances, pretreatment may be required before acceptance of the waste for final treatment by the city. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-58. - Sampling and analysis. 
    The city will employ independent engineers to conduct a twenty-four-hour composite sampling and analysis of the wastewater at least once per three (3) months. This analysis will be the basis for determining the surcharge. 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-59. - Penalties. 
(a)  Any person found to be in violation of any provisions of this division shall be served by the city with a written notice stating the nature of the violation, and if the violation continues for more than twenty (20) days following such written notice, the city may apply to the courts for the enforcement of the regulations set forth herein through the means of mandatory injunction or other remedial process. 
(b)  Such violation shall be punishable as a misdemeanor as provided in section 1-8. Each day in violation of the provisions of this division shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. The punishment shall be in addition to the remedial process provided for in subsection (a).

(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-67. - Basis of monthly service charge. 
    The system for computing each customer's monthly service charge shall be known as the "winter base rate system," and shall be based on actual water consumption for the three (3) individual months as reflected in the water meter readings of: 
(1)  December 10 through January 9; 
(2)  January 10 through February 9; and 
(3)  February 10 through March 9. 
The average of the monthly service charges in these three (3) months, based on the customer's actual water consumption, shall be the monthly service charge rendered to the customer by the city in each of the remaining nine (9) months of the year, meter readings March 10 through December 9. 
    Customers new to the city's system and who have no previous December through February consumption record shall be charged an amount equal to the average service charge for all customers of the city's system, until such time as said customer has established actual consumption data for the "winter base rate" months as outlined above. 
    Customers classified as "commercial" shall select, in writing and prior to March 31 of each year, between the "winter base rate system" or actual monthly sewer service charges for the remainder of the year. Once a decision has been made by the commercial customer, it cannot be changed prior to March 31 of the following year. The absence of a written selection by the commercial customer shall result in its charge being computed using the "winter base rate system." 
(Ord. No. 89-10, § 1, 8-21-89) 
Sec. 14-68. - Schedule of monthly wastewater service charge. 
    The schedule to be utilized for the computation of monthly charges for wastewater service is as follows: 
(1)  Each residential or commercial customer of the city's system, whether inside or outside the city, must pay such customer's proportionate share of the costs for operation and maintenance of the system. In addition, each customer of the city's sanitary wastewater system must pay an amount to share the costs of debt service and to provide for special reserve funds.

ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
DIVISION 1. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 14-130. - Findings. 
    The city council of the city makes the following findings: 
(1)  The professional engineering and financing analysis (NPDES Phase II Stormwater Program Assessment as prepared by Woolpert, LLP, October 1, 2001) submitted to the city properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
(2)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(3)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(4)  The stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to, location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
(5)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program's operating and capital investment needs. 
(6)  The city council finds, concludes and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in the city. 
(7)  An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges for all properties within the city that is related to costs associated with the stormwater management services within the city. The schedule of service charges can be augmented by other funding sources as may be determined by city council. 
(8)  Impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and associated costs throughout the city, and therefore, is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits. 
(9)  A service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems and operations can effectively reduce the utility's burden of stormwater quantity and/or quality control requirements. 
(10)  Service charge credits may be appropriate when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system, thus reducing the utility's cost of public education. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 3-4-02; Ord. No. 02-03, § II, 5-6-02) 
Sec. 14-131. - Establishment of a stormwater utility. 
    In accordance with section 48-14-120 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, there is hereby established a stormwater utility within the city which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 3-4-02) 
Sec. 14-132. - Definitions. 
    Credit. A conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system, facility, service, or activity that reduces the stormwater utility's costs. Credits for on-site stormwater systems should be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the site. 
    Customers of the stormwater utility. Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisitions, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program. 
    Development intensity factor (DIF). The ratio of a developed property's runoff coefficient (C) to the standard residential unit's runoff coefficient (C). A development intensity factor (DIF) shall be determined by calculating an average runoff coefficient (C) from several similar uses within each classification. Dividing the calculated "C" value by the ERU "C" value of 0.35 derives the DIF. 
    Developed property. Land altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than two hundred (200) square feet of impervious surface as defined in this chapter. 
    Equivalent residential unit (ERU). The median average impervious surface of residential properties in the city. ERUs shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service charges to all properties within the city. One ERU is one-third ( 1/3 ) acre of developed land with a runoff coefficient (C) of 0.35. 
    Hydrologic response. The hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and/or is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area, the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property, antecedent moisture conditions, and groundwater conditions on a property. 
    Impervious surfaces. Impervious surfaces are those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and solid surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
    Nonresidential properties. Developed nonresidential properties, including, but not limited to, commercial and office buildings, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, churches, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals, convalescent centers, assisted living facilities, and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces. 
    Residential properties. 
(1)  Single-family residential properties: Developed land whereon one or two (2) residential dwelling units are located on one platted lot, including, but not limited to, attached or unattached single-family homes, duplexes, mobile homes, manufactured homes, condominiums, or townhouses. 
(2)  Multi-family residential properties: Developed land whereon three (3) or more residential dwelling units are located on one platted lot, including, but not limited to, apartment complexes, retirement centers, and other structures in which multiple persons or family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. 
    Runoff coefficient (C). The proportion of rainfall volume that runs off an area, also known as the "C" factor. 
    Stormwater management service charges. The periodic rate, fee or charge applicable to a parcel of developed land. The charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the city stormwater utility. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel. The use of impervious areas as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including, but not limited to, charges for site and development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, stormwater system connections, and enhanced levels of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city. 
    Stormwater management system. Stormwater management systems address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. 
    Undeveloped properties. Land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 3-4-02; Ord. No. 02-03, § II, 5-6-02) 
Sec. 14-133. - Scope of responsibility for the city drainage system. 
    The city drainage system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the city which control and/or convey stormwater through which the city intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which: 
(1)  Are located within public streets, rights-of-way, and easements; 
(2)  Are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or 
(3)  Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
    Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the state and the United States of America. 
    It is the intent of this Code to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 3-4-02) 
Sec. 14-134. - Requirements for on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections. 
    All property owners and developers of developed real property within the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all city development regulations and the laws of the state and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien in the court of jurisdiction in the county. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this code, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 3-4-02) 
Sec. 14-135. - Establishment of a stormwater management enterprise fund. 
    A stormwater management enterprise fund shall be established in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the city council. Any revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater management enterprise fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the stormwater management enterprise fund, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater management enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the city council, upon recommendation of the city administrator. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 3-4-02) 
Sec. 14-136. - General financing policy. 
    It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater utility be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater services and facilities. Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. The cost of stormwater services and facilities may include operating, capital investment, and reserve expenses, and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management requirements. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees, or licenses. Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the city, whether within or outside the stormwater utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, and special assessments. To the extent practicable, credits against service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by private property owners. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 3-4-02) 
Sec. 14-137. - Determination and modification of stormwater management service charges. 
    In accordance with section 48-14-120 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, the city council shall determine and modify from time to time the stormwater management service charges. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the objective of the council to establish rates, fees and charges that are fair and reasonable, reflect the value of stormwater management services and facilities to those properties who benefit therefrom and, which together with any other sources of revenue that may be made available to the stormwater utility, will be sufficient to meet the cost of budgeted programs, services and facilities, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on revenue bond obligations incurred for construction and improvements to the stormwater system. 
(Ord. No. 02-03, § II, 5-6-02) 
Sec. 14-138. - Stormwater management service charges. 
    For the purposes of determining the stormwater management service charges, all properties should be classified as single-family residential, multi-family residential, nonresidential or undeveloped. 
    The following stormwater management service charge rates shall apply: 
(1)  Stormwater management service charge rate. The stormwater management service charge per equivalent residential unit (ERU) shall be five dollars ($5.00) per month. 
(2)  Single-family residential properties. Single-family residential properties shall be charged the rate applicable to one equivalent residential unit (ERU) for each dwelling unit. 
(3)  Multi-family residential properties. Multi-family residential properties shall be charged the rate applicable to three-quarters (0.75) equivalent residential unit (ERU) for each dwelling unit. 
(4)  Nonresidential developed properties. All developed lands not classified as single-family or multi-family residential use properties shall be classified as nonresidential developed. Each nonresidential developed property shall be classified according to its primary developed use. If a developed property could be placed into more than one classification according to its primary use, it should be classified in the category resulting in the lowest stormwater management service charge. Nonresidential developed properties shall be billed based upon its number of ERUs. The number of ERUs shall be determined by the classified use, the associated "C" factor, and the number of acres in the property. The following formula illustrates how the number of ERUs is derived for each nonresidential property. 
1 ERU = 0.35 FOR 1/3 ACRE 
# of ERUs = Property's "C" Factor × # Acres in Property 0.35 0.33 acres per ERU  
(5)  Land use and runoff coefficient table. 
Land Use Classification Runoff Coefficient (C) # of ERUs Per Acre Industrial/manufacturing 0.42 3.64 School 0.52 4.50 Nursing home/assisted living 0.53 4.59 Auto sales 0.54 4.68 Professional office 0.61 5.28 Hotel/motel 0.66 5.71 Retail/professional service 0.67 5.80 Church/assembly/funeral home 0.75 6.49 Child care 0.75 6.49 Shopping center/large retail 0.76 6.58 Restaurant/tavern/night club 0.8 6.93 Self-storage/mini warehouse 0.81 7.01 Gas station/convenience store 0.83 7.19 Properties with 25% or less of impervious surface 1.00 on calculated impervious surface 8.66 per acre of impervious surface  
(6)  Shopping centers/large retail. Tenants within a shopping center should be placed into the category of "shopping center/large retail." The number of ERUs used in determining a tenant's individual stormwater management service charge should be determined as follows: 
Step 1-The number of ERUs for the entire shopping center should be calculated in accordance with section 14-138(d)(e). 
Step 2-Credits should be deducted as applicable. 
Step 3-ERUs for each tenant will be determined by the per centage of the center's gross building square footage occupied by the tenant. 
Customers that have fee-simple ownership of property within a shopping center should be considered as individual customers separate from the center. The building area of these customers will not be included in the center's gross building area. However, these customers may be eligible for some of the same credits applicable to the center. 
(7)  Undeveloped properties. Undeveloped properties shall not be charged a stormwater management service charge. 
(Ord. No. 02-03, § II, 5-6-02; Ord. No. 2014-18 , § I, 11-17-14) 
Sec. 14-139. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater management service charges. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater management service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. 
(b)  A stormwater management service charge credit technical manual has been prepared by the city specifying on-site systems, facilities, activities, and services which qualify for application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. This manual is incorporated by reference and may be updated by the stormwater utility as the need arises. The city stormwater utility director shall be responsible for maintaining the technical manual consistent with the policies and guidelines established herein. 
(c)  Undeveloped properties as defined in this chapter shall be exempt from stormwater management service charges. 
(d)  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater management service charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater management service charges. 
(e)  The stormwater management service charge non-educational credit may be up to fifty (50) per cent of the service charge applicable to a property, and should be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost. 
(f)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the stormwater management service charge credit technical manual and/or upon continuing provision of the systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. A credit may be revoked by the city at any time for noncompliance. 
(g)  An educational credit may be available to all public and private schools or school systems which agree to teach the "Action for a Cleaner Tomorrow" program, an environmental science curriculum approved by the state department of education, in grades kindergarten (K) through twelve (12). The educational credit may be up to fifty (50) per cent of the service charge applicable to a school property, and should be proportional to the extent the approved curriculum is taught. The superintendent of schools shall certify annually to the storm water utility director, before July 1, the extent to which the curriculum was taught. Educational credits may be taken in conjunction with any other credit available under this section, except that maximum credits for all quality control, quantity control, and educational measures should not exceed seventy-five (75) per cent. 
(h)  No credit may result in any property being charged a stormwater management service charge based on less than 1.0 ERU. 
(Ord. No. 02-03, § II, 5-6-02) 
Sec. 14-140. - Appeals. 
    Any nonresidential customer who believes the provisions of this article have been applied in error may appeal in the following manner: 
(1)  An appeal accompanied by an appeal review fee should be filed in writing with the city stormwater utility director. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal may, if applicable, include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events. 
(2)  Using the information provided by the appellant, the director may conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within thirty (30) days.

One-inch sizing: The first one inch of water from any storm event, draining from that portion of the site that discharges to the stormwater treatment unit, must be collected and released over a twenty-four-hour period. 
b.  Dry ponds are not an acceptable stand-alone water quality treatment technology. When used they should be proceeded by a forebay and used in conjunction with infiltration, vegetative filters, or inline treatment. Dry ponds must dewater within seventy-two (72) hours. 
c.  Technologies that may be used to meet water quality requirements include but are not limited to infiltration, bioretention, in-line treatment devices, disconnected impervious areas, vegetated filter strips, constructed wetlands, and wet ponds. Vegetative swales combined with bioretention or another infiltration technology is the preferred method of water quality treatment. Landscaped areas should be designed, where possible, to incorporate stormwater management. Peak flow control may be achieved by adding inline or overflow storage such as parking lot detention, pipe storage or a dry pond. 
(Ord. No. 04-09, § I, 7-19-04) 
Sec. 14-170.5. - Design guidelines.

(Ord. No. 04-09, § I, 7-19-04) 
Sec. 14-170.6. - Variances. 
    The city stormwater management department (SWMD) may grant a written variance from any requirement of the City of North Augusta Storm Drainage Policy if there are exceptional circumstances applicable to the site such that strict adherence to the provisions of these regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and not fulfill the intent of the policy. A written request for variance shall be provided to the SWMD and shall state the specific variances sought and the reasons with supporting data for their granting. The SWMD shall not grant a variance unless and until the applicant provides sufficient specific reasons justifying the variance. The SWMD will conduct its review of the request for variance within ten (10) working days. Failure of the SWMD to act by the end of the tenth working day will result in the automatic approval of the variance. 
    A project may be eligible for a waiver or variance of stormwater management for water quantity control if the applicant can demonstrate that: 
(1)  The proposed project will return the disturbed area to a pre-development runoff condition and the pre-development land use is unchanged at the conclusion of the project. 
(2)  The proposed project does not increase the rate of runoff from a site by more than one cfs for each of the two-, ten- and twenty-five-year storm events and the disturbed area is less than one acre. 
(3)  The proposed project will have no significant adverse impact on the receiving natural waterway or downstream properties; or 
(4)  The imposition of peak control requirements for rates of stormwater runoff would aggravate downstream flooding. 
(Ord. No. 04-09, § I, 7-19-04) 
Sec. 14-170.7. - Inspection. 
(a)  The SWMD shall conduct routine inspections and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with the stormwater and sediment control plan as approved.

    The city understands the fundamental need to make efficient use of the limited and valuable water resource under its stewardship in order to protect the public's health and safety and environmental integrity. The objective of this drought response plan is to establish authority, policy and procedure by which the city will take the proper actions to manage water demand during a drought-related shortage. This article satisfies the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000 (Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1976, § 49-23-10 et seq., as amended) and has the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use, sanitation, and fire protection and of allocating water for other purposes in an equitable manner. 
    This article outlines the actions to be taken for the conservation of water supplied by the city during times of water shortage resulting for either system failure of drought conditions. These actions are directed both towards an overall reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply. 
    To satisfy these goals, the city hereby adopts the following regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water. This article is hereby declared necessary for the protection of public health, safety and welfare. 
    If it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to drought or system failure, the city is authorized to issue a proclamation that existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual water-use demands. The proclamation is an attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent that water-use for human consumption, sanitation, fire protection, and other essential needs becomes endangered. 
    Immediately upon issuance of such a proclamation, regulations and restrictions set forth under this article shall become effective and remain in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the proclamation rescinded. 
    Water uses that are regulated or prohibited under this article are considered to be non-essential and continuation of such uses during times of water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water, subjecting the offender(s) to penalties. 
(Ord. No. 03-14, § I, 7-21-03) 
Sec. 14-172. - Definition of terms.

(Ord. No. 03-14, § I, 7-21-03) 
Sec. 14-173. - Drought management plan. 
(a)  Introduction. To ensure that the city adequately manages its water resources during drought-related or system failure conditions, an organized plan is necessary for system operation and reliability, proper communications, effective coordination and ultimate allocation of water use. 
(b)  Designation of water system drought response representative. The drought response representative for the city is: 
City Administrator 
400 East Buena Vista Avenue 
P. O. Box 6400 
North Augusta, South Carolina 29861-6400 
(c)  Identification of water system specific drought or water shortage indicators. The city has developed triggers for use during drought or demand water shortages that describe when specific phases of the drought response plan are implemented. The system triggers are as follows: 
Level 2/Moderate drought phase 
  River-flow less than three thousand (3,000) cubic feet per second for seven (7) or more consecutive days; or 
  Inability to recover full system storage for two (2) consecutive days; or 
  Eighty-five (85) per cent of production capacity for five (5) consecutive days. 
Level 3/Severe drought phase 
  River-flow less than two thousand four hundred (2,400) cubic feet per second for seven (7) or more consecutive days; or 
  Inability to recover full system storage for five (5) consecutive days; or 
  Ninety (90) per cent of production capacity for five (5) consecutive days. 
Level 4/Extreme drought phase 
  River-flow less than one thousand five hundred (1,500) cubic feet per second for seven (7) or more consecutive days; or 
  Inability to recover full system storage for seven (7) consecutive days; or 
  Ninety-five (95) per cent of production capacity for five (5) consecutive days. 
(d)  Moderate drought phase. Upon notification by the drought response committee that a moderate drought condition is present and is expected to persist and upon determination by the city that a moderate water supply shortage exists based on trigger levels, the city will seek voluntary reductions from its customers in the use of water for all purposes and/or voluntary reductions on using water during certain peak water demand periods. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of twenty (20) per cent in residential water use and fifteen (15) per cent in other water uses such as commercial, industrial, institutional and irrigation; and a reduction in overall water use of fifteen (15) per cent. To accomplish this, the following actions will be taken: 
(1)  Issue a proclamation to be released to local media, city customers and to the state department of natural resources drought information center that moderate drought conditions are present in the city. 
(2)  Provide written notification to the state department of natural resources drought information center and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the city service area the voluntary conservation measures that the customers are requested to follow during moderate drought conditions, including, but not limited to:

(3)  Intensity maintenance efforts to identify and correct water leaks in the distribution system. 
(4)  Continue to encourage and educate customers to use water wisely. 
(e)  Severe drought phase. Upon notification by the drought response committee that a severe drought condition is present and is expected to persist and upon determination by the city that a severe water supply shortage exists based on trigger levels, the city will seek voluntary reduction in the use of water for all purposes and mandatory restrictions on non-essential usage and restrictions on times when certain water usage is allowed. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of twenty-five (25) per cent in residential water use, twenty (20) per cent in all other water use categories, and a reduction in overall water use of twenty (20) per cent. To accomplish these goals, the city will take the following actions: 
(1)  Issue a proclamation to be released to the local media, city water system customers and to the state department of natural resources drought information center that severe drought conditions are present in city. 
(2)  Provide written notification to the state department of natural resources drought information center and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the city service area that voluntary conservation measures and mandatory restrictions are to be placed on the use of water supplied by the utility, including, but not limited to:

(7)  Provide written notification monthly to the state department of natural resources drought information center regarding the success of the voluntary and mandatory restrictions. 
(f)  Extreme drought phase. Upon notification by the drought response committee that an extreme drought condition is present and is expected to persist and upon determination by the city that an extreme water supply shortage exists based on the trigger levels, the city will impose mandatory restrictions in the use of water for all purposes and/or on the times when certain water usage is allowed. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of thirty (30) per cent in residential water use, twenty-five (25) per cent in all other categories of water uses and a reduction in overall water use of twenty-five (25) per cent. To accomplish these goals, the city will take the following actions: 
(1)  Issue a proclamation to be released to the local media, water system customers and to the state department of natural resources drought information center that extreme drought conditions are present in the city. 
(2)  Provide written notification to the state department of natural resources drought information center and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the city service area that mandatory restrictions are to be placed on the use of water supplied by the utility, including, but not limited to: 
a.  Limiting residential water use to fifty-five (55) gallons per person per day and a maximum of one hundred seventy (170) gallons per household or ERU per day. 
b.  Eliminate landscape irrigation by the utility's customers. 
c.  Mandatory restrictions on the use of water supplied by the utility for activities including, but not limited to the following: 
1.  Eliminate the washing down of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, tennis courts and other hard surfaced areas; 
2.  Eliminate the washing down of buildings for purposes other than immediate fire protection; 
3.  Eliminate the flushing of gutters; 
4.  Eliminate domestic washing of motorbikes, boats, cars, etc.;

3.  Limit irrigating golf courses and any portion of their grounds; 
4.  Cease water service to customers who have been given a ten-day notice to repair one or more leaks and have failed to do so; and 
5.  Limit expanding commercial nursery facilities, placing new irrigated agricultural land in production, or planting or landscaping when required by site design review process. 
(3)  Intensify maintenance efforts to identify and correct water leaks in the distribution system. 
(4)  Continue to cease installation of new irrigation taps on the water system. 
(5)  Outline other conservation measures. These may include: 
a.  Encourage all residential water customers to voluntarily reduce overall monthly water usage to seventy (70) per cent of the customer's monthly average. If voluntary reduction of usage is not successful, the city may, at its option, implement the following excessive use rate schedule for water: 
Tier I 0-225 gallons/ERU/day regular rate Tier II 226-300 gallons/ERU/day 2 times regular rate Tier III Over 300 gallons/ERU/day 3 times regular rate  
b.  Impose a drought surcharge per thousand gallons of water that increases with higher usage. The general principle behind the drought surcharge is that the fee is imposed on water use in excess of two hundred twenty-five (225) gallons use. The drought surcharge is a temporary fee imposed during the current water supply shortage and is not a cost-based rate. The drought surcharge is temporary and will be terminated at such time as the city determines the water supply is above the trigger levels. 
c.  If conservation measures prove inadequate to mitigate the effects of the drought conditions or water supply availability, the city may take additional actions including, but not limited to: 
1.  Decreasing the gallon/ERU limits in the different tiers; 
2.  Reduction of water system pressure as needed. 
(6)  Publicize widely the penalties to be imposed for violations of mandatory restrictions and the procedures to be followed if a variance in the restrictions is requested. 
(7)  Expand the use of education and public relations efforts as conducted under the moderate and severe drought phase and emphasize the penalties associated with violating the mandatory restrictions. 
(8)  Provide written notification monthly to the state department of natural resources drought information center regarding the success of the mandatory restrictions. 
(g)  Rationing. If a drought threatens the protection of public health and safety, the city is hereby authorized to ration water. 
(h)  Enforcement of restrictions. If any customer of the state water system fails to comply with the mandatory water use restrictions of this article identified in (e)(2)c. and (F)(2)c., the customer shall be given a written notice of such failure to comply, which cites the date of said violation, and shall be assessed surcharges in accordance with the following schedule: 
First violation - Twenty-five dollar ($25.00) surcharge shall be added to the customer's water bill; 
Second violation within a thirty-day period - An additional fifty dollar ($50.00) surcharge shall be added to the customer's water bill; 
Third violation within a thirty-day period - The customer's water service shall be terminated and restored only after payment of a surcharge of one hundred dollars ($100.00) in addition to all previously assessed surcharges. 
Law enforcement agencies and other authorized agencies or designated employees in the respective jurisdiction that is being supplied water by the city shall diligently enforce the provisions of the drought response ordinance. 
(i)  Variances. Customers, who in their belief are unable to comply with the mandatory water use restrictions of this drought response article, may petition for a variance from restrictions by filing a petition with the city within ten (10) working days after the issuance of the proclamation requiring water use restrictions. All petitions for variance shall contain the following information: 
(1)  Name and address of the petitioner; 
(2)  Purpose of water usage; 
(3)  Special provision from which the petitioner is requesting relief; 
(4)  Detailed statement as to how the curtailment declaration adversely affects the petitioner; 
(5)  Description of the relief desired; 
(6)  Period of time for which the variance is sought; 
(7)  Economic value of the water use; 
(8)  Damage or harm to the petitioner or others if petitioner complies with this article; 
(9)  Restrictions with which the petitioner is expected to comply and the compliance date; 
(10)  Steps the petitioner is taking to meet the restrictions from which the variance is sought and the expected date of compliance; and 
(11)  Other information as needed. 
In order for the variance to be granted, the petitioner must demonstrate clearly that compliance with this article cannot be technically accomplished during the duration of the water supply shortage without having an adverse impact upon the best interests of the community. The city is authorized to grant the request for variance. 
In addition, the city is authorized to grant temporary variances for existing water uses otherwise prohibited under this article if it is determined that failure to grant such variances could cause an emergency condition adversely affecting health, sanitation and fire protection for the public. No such variance shall be retroactive or otherwise justify any violation of this article occurring prior to the issuance of the variance. Variances granted shall include a timetable for compliance and shall expire when the water supply shortage no longer exists, unless the petitioner has failed to meet specified requirements.

1.1 TITLE
This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Development Code of the City of
North Augusta.
1.2 GENERAL PURPOSE AND INTENT
1.2.1 Comprehensive Development Code
The Development Code as established in this Chapter has been made in accordance
with a comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting health, safety, and the general
welfare of the community. It is intended to consolidate in one place and in logical order,
without unnecessary duplication, the citys regulations pertaining to land use and
development. It is designed to make it possible for all of those concerned with land use
and development to have access to all relevant city legislation in one convenient
Chapter that is capable of being published and distributed as a separate and
comprehensive segment of the Code of Ordinances, City of North Augusta, South
ARTICLE 1  GENERAL PURPOSE
North Augusta Development Code 1-2
Carolina, hereinafter referred to as the City Code, as a whole. The specific objectives of
this Chapter are:
1.2.1.1 To protect the health, safety and general welfare; and
1.2.1.2 To promote new development forms that complete neighborhoods that:
a. Are designed at a human scale by controlling massing and design that respects the
architectural vernacular of North Augusta;
b. Foster communication among neighbors and connectivity to the larger community by
allowing compact development patterns, interconnected street systems, short blocks;
c. Include or reinforce central places, such as North Augustas traditional downtown
and neighborhood commercial centers, civic gathering places, and open space;
d. Encourage walking and biking by the layout of blocks and streets;
e. Accommodate vehicular travel without allowing parking lots and streets to dominate
the built environment;
f. Provide a mix of housing types, including housing affordable to all households and
housing arrangements that foster neighborliness;
g. Provide a variety of spaces, including outdoor and passive outdoor uses, which
become part of the public realm;
h. Design streets as outdoor rooms, with attention to pedestrian and bicyclist safety as
well as to the safety of motorists;
i. Includes neighborhood design that responds to the natural, cultural and historic
context;
j. Are the result of a planning process that is inclusive and involves opportunities for
negotiation between the designer and the City.
1.2.2 Zoning Regulations

consolidate the location of regulations governing the processing of permits for the
development of land. The purpose is to ensure that notification and procedures comply
with state law, provide ample opportunity for public participation in the land development
process, provide for the efficient and timely processing of development permits, and
promote the readability of the document for the general public and for applicants
requesting a permit.

2.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to consolidate the regulations pertaining to patterns of
development that occur within the city. These Use Patterns reflect either the majority of
anticipated permitting activity or patterns, such as Traditional Neighborhood
Development (TND), that the city would like to encourage. Each section in this Article
describes the Use Pattern, the procedure for approval and the standards relating to
approval, with cross-references to other parts of this Chapter where needed. The intent
is to present a visual, user-friendly overview of the regulations that apply to those types
of uses or development styles.
The Use Patterns established in this Article are not zoning districts. Instead, they are
forms of development that may be permitted in the various zoning districts established
by this Chapter, where indicated in this Article or Article 3, Zoning Districts, or both. The
Use Patterns typically involve multiple uses on the same property. They are described
here and in the Use Matrix as a land use activity in order to trigger the appropriate
permitting process. Some multiple use developments, such as Planned Developments
(PD), involve multiple uses and are permitted through a special or overlay district.
However, a PD is not a land use activity, but rather a procedure for providing design
flexibility. By contrast, the Use Patterns are specific land use activities involving specific
land uses and design controls which produce a discrete pattern of development.
Each section is generally arranged as follows:
a. Applicability
b. Processing Procedures
c. Size and Location of Site
d. Uses and Dimensional Standards
ARTICLE 2  USE PATTERNS

f. Lot Layout
g. Street Design
h. Stormwater Management
i. Utilities
j. Open Space and Parks
k. Natural Resource Protection
l. Landscaping

n. Urban Design
2.2 GENERALLY
2.2.1 Criteria
This section provides the substantive criteria for approval of a proposed Use Pattern,
consistent with the Development Standards, Articles 6-18, of this Chapter.
2.2.2 Applicability
This section applies to any application for development approval where the applicant
chooses to develop pursuant to the standards and procedures of a Use Pattern
described in this Article. These provisions are optional, in that a decision to develop
pursuant to the regulations established herein is subject to the discretion of the
applicant. However, the improvement standards, parking requirements, and other
regulations may vary depending upon whether an applicant chooses to develop pursuant
to a Use Pattern established in this Article.
2.2.3 Standards
A Use Pattern shall comply with the following standards:
a. The applicable standards of this Article; and
b. The standards of Articles 6-18 of this Chapter, unless this Article indicates that a
particular Article does not apply.
2.2.4 Waiver
See §5.9
2.3 CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION
2.3.1 Purpose
Conventional subdivisions typically produce little open space except floodplains and
steep slopes. Common open space areas in conventional subdivisions are often
unusable or are devoted only to specific purposes, such as golf courses. Most open
space in conventional subdivisions is contained in private yards with no common access
or maintenance. Further, private open space typically involves lawns and landscaping
that require heavy maintenance and water demands. Accordingly, the purpose of this
section is to provide flexibility in site design in order to allow developers to preserve
common open space and natural resources in Conservation Areas within a subdivision.
ARTICLE 2  USE PATTERNS
North Augusta Development Code 2-4
The specific purposes of this section are:
a. To protect the public health, safety and general welfare by avoiding surface and
ground water pollution, contaminated runoff, air quality contamination and urban heat
islands which result from pavement and the clearing of natural vegetation;
b. To protect and preserve natural resources such as wetlands, streams, lakes, steep
slopes, woodlands and water recharge areas;
c. To reduce infrastructure and housing costs by reducing the engineering and
construction costs produced by conventional subdivision design, which requires
more pavement, wetland crossings, grading of trees and natural areas, and lawn and
landscaping maintenance;
d. To protect property values by allowing open space design features which enhance
the marketability of development;
e. To provide design flexibility; and
f. To promote development on soils which are most suitable for urban densities, while
preserving soils that are primarily adaptable to other uses such as woodlands,
wildlife habitat and agricultural uses.
2.3.2 Applicability
This section applies to any application meeting the requirements of this section and
which is designated a Conservation Subdivision by the applicant.
2.3.3 Processing Procedures
A Conservation Subdivision shall be processed in accordance with the subdivision
procedures of this Chapter.
2.3.4 Size and Location of Site
2.3.4.1 A Conservation Subdivision may be approved in any residential zoning
district, and with conditions in some commercial districts, where a Conservation
Subdivision is listed as a permitted use in Table 3-2, Use Matrix.
2.3.4.2 There is no minimum or maximum size for a Conservation Subdivision
provided, however, that the minimum open space requirements may limit the availability
of this option for some landowners. Parcels that cannot demonstrate compliance with the
minimum open space standards on-site shall dedicate and maintain an open space
system that is connected to an open space system on an adjacent site in accordance
with Article 11, Open Space and Parks.
2.3.4.3 Platted lots located within subdivisions and PDs shall be located outside
of the Conservation Areas, which constitute the total required open space. Conservation
Areas shall be placed in undivided preserves, although they are not required to be
contiguous.
2.3.5 Uses and Density
2.3.5.1 Permitted uses are governed by the applicable zoning district regulations.
2.3.5.2 In order to provide undivided open space, direct views and access, not
less than forty percent (40%) of the lots within a Conservation Subdivision shall abut a
Conservation Area. Direct pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not
ARTICLE 2  USE PATTERNS
North Augusta Development Code 2-5
adjoining the open space shall be provided through a continuous system of sidewalks
and Greeneways.
2.3.6 Lot Layout
2.3.6.1 A Conservation Subdivision shall comply with §3.5, except as otherwise
provided herein.
2.3.6.2 Lots within a Conservation Subdivision are not subject to the minimum lot
size, minimum frontage or minimum lot width requirements of the Use Matrix, Table 3-2.
2.3.6.3 Lots within one-hundred (100) feet of a Conservation Area shall front on a
Local Street, as defined in Article 14, Streets. Lots shall not front on a Collector or higher
order street.
2.3.7 Street Design
A Conservation Subdivision shall comply with Article 14, Streets, unless otherwise
provided, and this subsection. The design of local streets shall comply with the
standards for rural streets, as set forth in Article 14. The Connectivity Index for internal
streets as set forth in Article 14 shall not apply to local streets within a Conservation
Subdivision.
2.3.7.1 The Conservation Subdivision shall include a pedestrian circulation
system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site,
between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open
space system, by complying with the standards set forth herein. All sidewalks shall
connect to other sidewalks or with Greeneways, which in turn shall connect to potential
areas qualifying as Conservation Areas on adjoining undeveloped parcels or with
existing open space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable.
2.3.7.2 Streets shall not cross wetlands or existing slopes exceeding fifteen

2.4 NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER
2.4.1 Purpose
A Neighborhood Center provides shopping, service and employment opportunities within
walking or driving distance of residential areas. The Center is concentrated in a nodal
pattern, as opposed to conventional strip shopping centers. Neighborhood Centers
feature urban design guidelines such as zero setbacks and streetscapes with windows
and entryways.
This section is designed to permit Neighborhood Centers in a wider variety of districts
and situations, subject to strict design standards that prohibit strip development and
encourage walkable streetscapes. Freestanding commercial uses that do not meet the
standards of this section shall be located in a commercial zoning district.
North Augusta has a rich architectural tradition which has contributed significantly to the
citys image, economic growth and quality of life. The purpose of these regulations is to
provide specific criteria so that new buildings blend into the historic architectural
framework of the city. These criteria are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation
or variety, but rather to assist in focusing designs, which can result in creative solutions
that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within the city, preserve taxable values
and promote the public health, safety and general welfare. Unless otherwise specified in
this Chapter, this section applies to all residential and commercial zoning districts.
This section encourages a mix of uses designed to foster the growth of the citys
neighborhoods as special places of the community and as mixed-use activity centers.
These standards promote a quality urban streetscape and a pedestrian friendly
environment, provide for the establishment of a variety of mixed uses in neighborhoods,
provide for an orderly development pattern, serve to maintain a supply of developable
land while preserving compact development, improve traffic circulation and promote
alternatives to automobile travel. These standards also serve to provide housing
opportunities within walking distance of employment, provide service and retail
opportunities, maintain an overall design theme, preserve a human scale for new
buildings, provide economic development opportunities through clean industry, office
and commercial uses, and provide for the daily needs and services of the community.
This section requires new commercial buildings using the Neighborhood Commercial
option to respect the citys architectural heritage, while preserving flexibility to adapt to
modern conditions.

2.4.2 Applicability
This section shall apply to any application meeting the requirements of this section and
which is designated a Neighborhood Center by the applicant.
2.4.3 Processing Procedures
A Neighborhood Center requires approval of a site plan, or may be approved as part of a
PD.
2.4.4 Size and Location of Site
2.4.4.1 A Neighborhood Center may be located at the intersection of any of the
street classifications and within the zoning districts as set forth in Table 2-1,
Neighborhood Center Intersection Locations. In Table 2-1, a P indicates that a
Neighborhood Center may be established as of right, unless otherwise indicated below,
at the intersection of the street classifications listed in Column A and in the zoning
district designated in Columns B through D. A dash (--) indicates that the
Neighborhood Center is not permitted at that location. A C indicates that a
Neighborhood Center may be permitted only upon approval of a conditional use.

2.4.4.2 No Neighborhood Center shall be approved in a location where the
combined lineal frontage of commercial uses, including the Neighborhood Center,
exceeds five hundred (500) feet. A Neighborhood Center shall not be established within
one thousand, three hundred twenty (1,320) feet or one quarter (1/4) of a mile of another
Neighborhood Center or commercial zoning district unless it is located in an NC,
Neighborhood Commercial zoning district. This distance shall be measured from the
exterior boundary of the lot or parcel on which the existing and proposed Neighborhood
Centers and existing Neighborhood Centers or commercial zoning districts are located.
2.4.4.3 The establishment of a Neighborhood Center shall not justify or establish
a precedent for higher-density or more intense zoning between the nodes or
intersections where the Neighborhood Centers are established.
2.4.5 Uses and Dimensional Standards
2.4.5.1 A Neighborhood Center may include any of the uses permitted in the NC,
Neighborhood Commercial zoning district.
ARTICLE 2  USE PATTERNS

2.4.6.1 If the proposed development includes at least fifteen thousand (15,000)
gross square feet of building for all uses, at least zero-point-three (0.3) square feet of
parks and open space shall be provided for each square foot of non-residential space.
The parks and open space shall include only a plaza, playground, courtyard or
Greeneway, and shall be maintained as provided in Article 11, Open Space and Parks.
No other provisions of Article 11 shall apply to a Neighborhood Center. Up to fifty
percent (50%) of this space may be combined with landscaping areas required by Article
10, Landscaping.
2.4.6.2 Not less than one (1) linear foot of seating shall be provided for each fifty
(50) square feet of open space. Seating dimensions shall comply with the requirements
of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and/or S.C. Code §10-5-250, as applicable.

sculptures, arbors, trellises, planted beds, drinking fountains, clock pedestals, awnings,
outdoor restaurant seating or canopies.
Comment: Approximately twenty-eight percent (28%) of the current provided demand for
open space and parks is attributable to non-residential demand, or zero-point-four (0.4)
square feet per square foot of estimated non-residential space. This figure is adjusted to
zero-point-three (0.3) square feet to be consistent with the National Recreation and Park
Association recommended level of service, which is lower than that currently provided by
the city and produces a more conservative figure.
2.4.7 Landscaping
A Neighborhood Center shall comply with Article 10, Landscaping.
2.4.8 Urban Design
With the exception of uses and density, buildings shall conform to the standards for A
streets as designated in the D, Downtown Mixed Use District.
2.5 COMMERCIAL REDEVELOPMENT
2.5.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to encourage the redevelopment of existing shopping
centers, big-box retail sites and other sites characterized by large expanses of surface
parking into a development pattern that is pedestrian friendly, compatible with
surrounding development, visually attractive and which reduces reliance on the
automobile for vehicular trips. This section also permits the market to enhance the value
of such sites by adding new uses to economically distressed or struggling sites,
upgrading design quality and allowing income generation (rent to be collected) from
areas formerly designated as free parking.
2.5.2 Applicability
Existing parking lots adjoining the frontage of any site located within a commercial
zoning district may be replaced with buildings. Minimum parking requirements may be
reduced by fifty percent (50%), setbacks may be reduced by fifty percent (50%) and
maximum height may be increased by thirty-three percent (33%). (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord.
2008-18)
2.5.3 Processing Procedures

possible, existing and new street rights of way, and public and internal private access
drives. The facades shall conform to the requirements for A streets in the D, Downtown
Mixed Use District.
2.5.8 Street Design
In lieu of the requirements of §14.8.3.3, a Commercial Redevelopment is permitted one
(1) access point for every one hundred fifty (150) feet of frontage. If, however, the
Commercial Redevelopment fronts on more than one (1) street or thoroughfare, an
access point on each frontage shall be required if feasible.
2.5.9 Stormwater Management
A Commercial Redevelopment shall comply with Article 15, Stormwater Management.

A Commercial Redevelopment is not subject to Article 10, Landscaping, except the
Parking Lot Landscape Area requirements of §10.6.
ARTICLE 2  USE PATTERNS
North Augusta Development Code 2-12
2.5.12 Parking
2.5.12.1 The minimum parking space requirements of Article 12, Parking, do not
apply to a Commercial Redevelopment. Additional parking may be placed to the rear of
principal buildings provided that the number of spaces for the entire site does not exceed
the maximum parking requirements of Article 12.
2.5.12.2 The applicant shall connect parking areas to parking lots on adjoining
properties in order to allow customers to drive to other locations without re-entering the
major roadway network and adding to traffic volumes. The Director may waive this
requirement where he finds that the requirement is not practicable due to unique site
topography, natural barriers to vehicular travel or similar obstacles.
2.5.12.3 Service entrances and service yards shall be located only in the rear or
side yard. Service yards shall be screened from adjacent residentially zoned or used
property by the installation of a buffer as set forth in Article 11, Open Space and Parks.
Not more than one (1) parking bay may be placed between any Additional Building
constructed or expanded and the street right of way pursuant to this section. Not more
than one (1) parking bay may be placed between the existing buildings and any
Additional Building constructed pursuant to this section.
2.6 TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT
2.6.1 Purpose
The Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) option permits the development of
land in a manner consistent with the historic and timelessness of North Augustas
existing neighborhoods. A TND combines a variety of housing types with commercial
and civic uses in a compact, walkable neighborhood setting. TNDs feature an
interconnected street network and setbacks appropriate to create a public realm built on
a human scale. A TND is developed such that the street network recognizes and
complements site topography and other natural features.
2.6.2 Applicability
A TND may be approved in any zoning district in which a TND is listed as a permitted
use, Table 3-2, Use Matrix.
2.6.3 Processing Procedures
2.6.3.1 This section applies to any application meeting the requirements of this
section and which is designated a TND subdivision by the applicant. Where the existing
zoning classification does not permit a TND, the applicant may request a rezoning. (Rev.
12-2-08; Ord. 2008-18)
2.6.3.2 Applications for subdivision approval in any of the districts in which a TND
is permitted may file a combined subdivision plat and site plan that complies with the
standards of this section and other applicable provisions of this Chapter. Such
applications shall be labeled TND Subdivision and may be processed and approved in
accordance with the site plan procedures and the subdivision plat procedures set forth in
Article 5, Approval Procedures.

2.6.4 Size and Location of Site
2.6.4.1 A TND may be located adjacent to, but shall not be bisected by, an
arterial street unless the street is designed to conform to the requirements of an avenue
or main street as set forth in Article 14, Streets.
2.6.4.2 If the TND is located adjacent to a collector or higher classification street
and the street is not designed to conform to the standards of an avenue or main street,
the following criteria shall apply:
a. The internal streets providing access to the TND shall be aligned perpendicular to
the collector or higher order street; and
b. The buildings or structures that take access from the internal streets shall face the
internal streets.
2.6.4.3 The site shall be divided into the following subareas:
a. A Center consisting of civic, retail, service and multi-family uses. The size of the
Center is based on the size of the entire site, as provided below. The Center shall
include a minimum building area of thirty-thousand (30,000) square feet gross floor
area. For a TND exceeding two hundred fifty (250) dwelling units, the TND Center
shall have a minimum area of one hundred twenty (120) square feet per dwelling
unit. A Center shall only be located on a main street as set forth in Article 14, Streets.
A continuous system of sidewalks shall connect the Center with streets and lanes
which provide access to dwelling units.
b. A neighborhood or series of neighborhoods consisting of multi-family and singlefamily
uses, small-scale retail and service uses and public outdoor gathering places.
It is the intent of this Chapter that all areas within a neighborhood are within a five (5)
minute walking distance from edge to edge. A neighborhood shall not exceed forty
(40) acres in size, not including greenbelts.
2.6.5 Dimensional Standards
2.6.5.1 The requested densities, in terms of number of units per gross residential
acre and total number of dwelling units, shall be set forth in the subdivision or site plan
application. The subdivision or site plan for a TND shall comply with Table 2-4, TND
Land Use Allocations. The applicable land use categories are set forth in Column A. The
minimum land area that shall be devoted to the land use is shown in Column B and the
maximum land area that shall be devoted to the land use is shown in Column C.
Minimum land area is stated as the percentage of gross land area. The density for the
particular use shall be at least the amount set forth in Column D for residential uses and
shall not exceed the amount shown in Column E. The Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for the
particular use shall be at least the amount set forth in Column F and shall not exceed the
amount shown in Column G.

matter is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Chapter. The
Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City
Clerk, together with the date of the adoption of this Chapter. Regardless of the existence
of purported copies of the Official Zoning Map which may from time to time be made or
published, or the Flood Insurance Rate Maps Boundary
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS

issued in the areas identified in §3.2.2.1 are hereby adopted. (Adopt. 2-1-10; Ord. 2010-
01)
3.2.3 Interpretations of Boundaries on Map(s)
The following rules shall apply to the interpretation of the boundaries of districts as shown
on the Official Zoning Map or the FIRM maps:
3.2.3.1 Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets,
highways, or roads shall be construed to follow such center lines.
3.2.3.2 Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be
construed as following platted lot lines.

If, in accordance with this Chapter and S.C. Code §6-29-720, changes are made in the
district boundaries or other matters portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes
shall be entered on said map(s) promptly after amendment has been approved by the City
Council. No amendment to this Chapter that involves matters portrayed on the Official
Zoning Maps shall become effective until after such changes has been made on said
Official Zoning Maps.
3.2.5 Annexation Zoning
All territory which may hereafter be granted or annexed to the City of North Augusta shall
be classified automatically in the R-14 District, except that at the time the application for
annexation is filed, the applicant may request a zoning classification which is similar to
surrounding zoning and/or in accord with the citys Comprehensive Plan. Proposed
annexations where the requested zoning is inconsistent with the Land Use Element of the
Comprehensive Plan or differs from zoning on adjacent properties shall be reviewed by
the Planning Commission in accordance with Article 18, Administration. The Planning
Commission shall recommend to the City Council the appropriate zoning for the property
to be annexed, modification to the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, or both.
3.3 BASE ZONING DISTRICTS
3.3.1 Purpose Statements and Supplemental Standards for Base
Zoning Districts
This section describes the purpose of each base zoning district in the city. The purpose
statements provide a foundation for the various standards applicable to the various zoning
districts, and assist in interpretation of the district standards. The purpose statements are
not regulations, but rather a summary of the district character and regulatory intent. The
particular uses permitted in each district are set forth in the Use Matrix, Table 3-2. The
dimensional standards, including setbacks and height limits, are provided in the
Dimensional Matrix, Table 3-3. Additional supplemental regulations for each district are
also included, where applicable.
3.3.2 Residential Districts
3.3.2.1 R-14 and R-10, Large and Medium Lot Single-Family Residential
Districts  The purpose of these two (2) districts is to recognize and promote the character
of particular areas in North Augusta where single-family residential development is the
predominant living environment. Also, changing patterns of work and home environments
create incentives to view the single-family dwelling as a place of work and residential living
activities.
3.3.2.2 R-7, Small Lot Single-Family Residential District  The purpose of this
district is to provide for a variety of single-family housing types on small lots to meet
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-6
market demands for smaller lot developments. It is also the intent of this district to balance
higher densities with common open space.
3.3.2.3 R-5, Mixed Residential District  The purpose of this district is to permit
a variety of residential uses and variable densities based on the character of such uses.
Areas so designated are deemed suited to such uses. This designation is applied
principally to undeveloped areas where units and density flexibility will not adversely
impact existing residential subdivisions and where the housing market can be sufficiently
broad and flexible to meet the various demands for housing. It also applies to existing
multi-family and mixed use residential areas.
3.3.3 Commercial Districts
The purpose of commercial districts is to provide commercial opportunities in certain areas
of the community in response to market conditions, but not at the expense of residential
areas or environmental amenities. Within the four (4) commercial districts, a building or
premises shall be used only for the permitted uses. No outdoor storage or display of goods
shall be permitted unless an outdoor use is conditionally approved pursuant to §4.33. No
business shall be established in or allowed to occupy a mobile home or manufactured unit
other than as an office for a mobile home sales lot.
3.3.3.1 OC, Office Commercial District  The purpose of this district is to
encourage the development of office activities with supportive retail, service and
residential uses, at a relatively high density and intensity. These districts are primarily
located on collector and arterial streets.
3.3.3.2 NC, Neighborhood Commercial District  The purpose of this district is
to provide for areas where small-scale commercial service and convenience uses may be
located to serve principally residential subdivisions and to permit small-scale professional
offices in such areas as compatible supplements. This district permits Neighborhood
Centers as defined in §2.4 of this Chapter.
a. Individual buildings shall not exceed the following:
1. Four thousand (4,000) square feet of gross floor area for a single story building; or
2. Four thousand (4,000) square foot building footprint for a mixed-use building or a
live-work unit, so long as the building does not exceed three (3) stories.
b. Commercial uses are limited to the first floor of a building only. Upper stories may be
used for residential and accessory storage only.
c. Buildings shall conform to the design standards established for the G, Georgia Avenue
Overlay District, or the NP, Neighborhood Preservation Overlay District.
d. Service entrances and service yards shall be located only in the rear or side yard.
Service yards shall be screened from adjacent residential zones or uses by the
installation and maintenance of a solid wall or fence having a height of not less than
four (4) feet or greater than six (6) feet or vegetation having a minimum height of four
(4) feet. Refuse enclosures shall be located at the rear of the site and screened with
a wall and gate.
e. No external sound systems or external live music shall be allowed in an NC district.
f. Parking areas for new buildings or structures shall be located in the rear or on the side
behind the front facade of the principal use or principal building. All parking areas shall
be screened from view on the front and side by the installation and maintenance of a
solid wall or fence having a height of not less than four (4) feet nor greater than six (6)
feet or dense vegetation having a minimum height of four (4) feet.
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-7
This subsection shall not apply to buildings which exist at the time of a rezoning to NC,
Neighborhood Commercial District, only to the extent that they do not conform with
this section.
3.3.3.3 GC, General Commercial District  The purpose of this district is to
provide for areas within the city where large-scale commercial developments may take
place. This district is designed to support citywide or regional shopping centers and
business complexes of greater magnitude than permitted by the OC, Office Commercial,
or NC, Neighborhood Commercial Districts. It permits a wide range of business and
commercial uses generally clustered for cumulative attraction and optimum accessibility,
but also in strips where so designated by the Comprehensive Plan.
3.3.3.4 TC, Thoroughfare Commercial District  The purpose of this district is to
accommodate commercial, light industrial and warehouse/distribution uses. These uses
need a high volume highway traffic zone. Such commercial uses typically depend upon a
regional commercial market characterized by bright and intensive signage designed to
gain the attention of passing motorists. Commercial uses of this nature are detrimental to
residential neighborhoods and professional commercial zones and, accordingly, are
limited to areas of the community where traffic volumes are the highest and residential
development and professional commercial land uses are the least prevalent.
3.3.3.5 D, Downtown Mixed Use District  The purpose of this district is to
promote a downtown commercial core which creates an identity and sense of place for
North Augusta. The district allows for a variety of commercial uses which are suited for a
downtown environment and create an attraction quality not deterred by parking or access
limitations. Often this quality is achieved by the type of business or customer loyalty
attributable to the particular business establishment. Buildings shall conform to the design
standards established for the G, Georgia Avenue Overlay District, or the NP,
Neighborhood Preservation Overlay District.
3.3.4 IND, Industrial District
The purpose of this district is to recognize the importance of industry to the community
and to protect such uses from potentially incompatible uses which would consume
industrially suited land for other purposes. It is also designed to encourage industrial park
development and promote landscaping of industrial plants, making them more palatable
to the residential environment of North Augusta. The district may also contain uses as
special exceptions that may be incompatible elsewhere in the City of North Augusta.
3.3.4.1 Performance Standards in the IND, Industrial District  All permitted
and approved conditional uses in the IND, Industrial District, shall, in addition to all
applicable state and federal regulations, meet the following minimum standards regulating
the emission or existence of dangerous, detrimental and objectionable elements, where
applicable.
a. Fire and Explosive Hazards: All activities and storage of flammable and explosive
materials at any point shall be provided with adequate safety devices against the
hazards of fire and explosion including adequate fire fighting and fire suppression
equipment.
b. Radioactive Emissions: There shall be no radiation emission measurable at the
property line.
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-8
c. Smoke, Dust, and Dirt: The emission of visible smoke, dust, dirt, fly ash particulate
matter from any pipe, vents, or other openings, or from any other source, into the air,
shall comply with the regulations of the South Carolina Department Health and
Environmental Control (SCDHEC).
d. Fumes, Vapor, and Gasses: There shall be no emission of any fumes, vapors, or
gasses, of a noxious, toxic, or corrosive nature which can cause any damage or
irritation to health, animals, vegetation, or to any form of property.
e. Vibration: There shall be no perceptible earth vibrations measured at the property line.
f. Heat, Cold, Dampness, or Movement of Air: Any activity which could produce any
adverse effect on the temperature, motion or humidity of the atmosphere beyond the
lot line is not permitted.
g. Odor: The emission of odorous gasses or other matter in such quantities as to be
offensive at the property line is prohibited. Any process which may involve the creation
or emission of any such odor shall be provided with both a primary and a secondary
safeguard system so that control may be maintained in the event of failure of the
primary safeguard system.
h. Glare: There shall be no direct or sky reflected glare, whether from floodlights, high
temperature processing, combustion, welding or otherwise, so as to be visible in any
residential district.
i. Compliance Guarantee: The applicant shall acknowledge in writing an understanding
of the performance standards applicable to the industry or business and shall submit
an agreement to conform with such standards at all times. Any violation of the
agreement shall constitute a violation of this Chapter.
3.3.4.2 Access  Lots meeting the frontage requirements shall be permitted only
one (1) access drive, irrespective of the number of establishments on the lot.
Notwithstanding §14.8 of this Chapter, a second access point may be permitted only when
the lot exceeds three hundred and fifty (350) feet of frontage. Where lots are contiguous,
establishments are encouraged to develop a shared ingress and egress drive to minimize
curb cuts and better facilitate moving traffic. Such shared access easements may be
required by the Planning Commission on referral by the Director, where such design would
obviously improve traffic conditions. Businesses on double frontage or corner lots should
be accessed from the street with the lowest functional classification where possible.
3.3.4.3 Building Height Requirements  Buildings and structures shall not
exceed seventy (70) feet in height. Manufacturing plants (buildings) are exempt from this
requirement. However, where such manufacturing plants exceed seventy (70) feet in
height, they shall, in addition to meeting the setback requirements stated above, be set
back from the side and rear yard property lines of residentially zoned and residentially
occupied property one (1) additional foot for each two (2) feet in height, exceeding seventy
(70) feet.
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-9
3.4 PERMITTED USES IN ZONING DISTRICTS
3.4.1 Generally
No use shall be permitted pursuant to this Chapter, and no development permit authorizing
a use may be authorized, issued, or approved by any officer, official, or agency, unless
said use is listed as a Permitted Use, Conditional Use or a Special Exception in the Use
Matrix, Table 3-2, and all applicable permits and approvals have been issued by the
agency or official with final decision-making authority. Those uses permitted as principal
uses or buildings within each zoning district shall be those uses listed in the Use Matrix,
Table 3-2.
3.4.2 Interpretation
The use categories listed in the Column A of the Use Matrix, Table 3-2, are defined in this
Chapter, the Land-Based Classification Standards (LBCS) published by the American
Planning Association (APA), the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS),
or in other resources cross-referenced in this Chapter.
3.4.3 Accessory and Temporary Uses
Permitted accessory uses and permitted temporary uses are set forth in the Use Matrix,
Table 3-2, and Article 4. If a use is listed as prohibited in a zoning district, but is permitted
as an accessory use in §4.2, the use is permitted only as an accessory use to a principal
use or principal building on the same lot, tract or parcel. Such uses cannot be established
unless and until there is a principal use or principal building on the same lot, tract or parcel
to which that use is accessory.
3.4.4 TND, P, PD, R-MH Districts
Uses in the TND, Traditional Neighborhood Development; P, Public Use; PD, Planned
Development; and R-MH Manufactured Home Residential are governed by their
respective sections in this Chapter, and are not subject to the Use Matrix, Table 3-2. (Rev.
12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
3.4.5 Uses Not Listed
3.4.5.1 The Director shall make a determination if a use not mentioned in the Use
Matrix, Table 3-2, can reasonably be interpreted to fit into a use category where similar
uses are described. Interpretations may be ratified by the Planning Commission at a
regularly scheduled meeting. It is the intent of this Article to group similar or compatible
land uses into specific zoning districts, either as permitted uses or as uses authorized by
a conditional use permit. Uses not listed as a permitted or conditional use are presumed
to be prohibited from the applicable zoning district. In the event that a particular use is not
listed in the Use Matrix, and such use is not listed as a prohibited use and is not otherwise
prohibited by law, the Director shall determine whether a materially similar use exists in
this section. Should the Director determine that a materially similar use does exist, the
regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed and the Directors
decision shall be recorded in writing. Should the Director determine that a materially
similar use does not exist, the matter may be referred to the Planning Commission for
interpretation or for recommendation to the City Council for amendment to this Chapter to
establish a specific listing for the use in question.
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-10
3.4.5.2 The Director may determine that a use is materially similar if:
a. The use is listed as within the same structure or function classification as the use
specifically enumerated in the Use Matrix, Table 3-2, as determined by the LBCS of
the APA. The use shall be considered materially similar if it falls within the same LBCS
classification or meets the requirements of sections (b.) and (c.), below.
b. If the use cannot be located within one of the LBCS classifications pursuant to section
(a.), above, the Director shall refer to the most recent edition of the North American
Industry Classification Manual (Executive Office of the President, Office of
Management and Budget, 1997) (NAICS), which document is hereby incorporated by
this reference. The use shall be considered materially similar if it falls within the same
industry classification of the NAICS, and meets the requirements of section (c.), below.
c. The proposed use shall not generate average daily trips exceeding other uses
proposed in the zoning district by more than ten percent (10%), as determined by the
most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation (6th
ed., 1997)(ITE Manual), which document is hereby incorporated by this reference. If
the trip generation is not listed in the ITE Manual, the use shall be considered
materially similar. The Director may also refer to similar local traffic studies to
determine trip generation and average daily trips.
3.4.5.3 In order to assist in interpretation of the Use Matrix, Table 3-2, the LBCS
and NAICS numbers precede each use in the Use Matrix.
In interpreting the Use Matrix, the following rules of construction shall apply:
a. If a use is listed for a specific classification, while a more general classification within
the same industry classification is also listed for another use, the specific classification
governs. The specific use is not permitted in all districts where the uses coded to the
general classification are permitted simply because they share a similar NAICS code
number. The numbers increase as the classifications get more specific.
(a) Example: Community Homes are coded as NAICS classification 623210. This is
a specific subclass of group 623 entitled Nursing and Residential Care Facilities.
Community Homes are permitted in the District X. However, other Nursing and
Residential Care Facilities listed in NAICS group 623 are not permitted in District X.
These uses will fall within the LBCS Function classifications 1210 (Retirement housing
services), 1220 (Congregate living services), 1230 (Assisted-living services), 1240
(Lifecare or continuing care services), and 1250 (Skilled-nursing services).
b. Some uses are listed separately, but fall within the same LBCS or NAICS
classification. The uses within one such classification are not permitted in all of the
zoning districts as the others simply because they fall within the same LBCS or NAICS
classification.
(b) Example: Restaurant, with incidental consumption of alcoholic beverages is
coded as LBCS Structure 2220. A Restaurant, no consumption of alcoholic
beverages permitted is also coded as Structure 2220. The former is listed as a
prohibited use in District X. It is not considered a permitted use in X simply because
it falls within the same LBCS classification as the latter use.

3.5 DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS IN BASE ZONING DISTRICTS
3.5.1 General
3.5.1.1 This section establishes minimum and maximum standards for the height,
number of stories and size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lots that
may be occupied, the size of yards, courts and other open spaces, the density of
population, and the location and use of buildings pursuant to S.C. Code §6-29-720.
Developments in the PD and TND districts are governed by their respective sections in
this Chapter and are not subject to the dimensional and density regulations of §3.5 or
Table 3-3, Dimensional Standards.
3.5.1.2 No land or building shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or
structure, or part thereof, shall be constructed, erected, altered or moved unless in
conformity with all of the regulations specified in this section for the zoning district in
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-25
which it is or will be located. No building permit shall be issued unless the proposed
building or structure conforms to the standards established in this section.
3.5.2 Residential Density
3.5.2.1 No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied in excess
of the prescribed density regulations, nor accommodate a greater number of dwelling units
than prescribed for in the zoning district in which it is or will be located in accordance with
the limitations established in Table 3-3, Dimensional Standards.
3.5.2.2 In computing density for large tracts or multi-unit housing projects, the
density limits established by the zoning district apply. Densities may exceed the maximum
on part of a tract, if the overall density on the total project site does not exceed the limits
established by the zoning district. Applicants shall provide a concept plan consistent with
Appendix A, Definitions, that provides an overall development plan and delineates the
density for each phase of development.
3.5.2.3 For conventional subdivisions, this Chapter does not establish a maximum
or minimum number of total permitted dwelling units, because the total number of dwelling
units is governed by minimum lot size. Conservation subdivisions are not subject to
minimum lot size requirements, but total permitted dwelling units shall not exceed the
amount established as set forth in Table 3-3, Dimensional Standards.
3.5.3 Intensity in Nonresidential Districts
Unless otherwise stated, all references to non-residential intensity shall be deemed to
refer to Floor Area Ratio (FAR). Example of 0.5 FAR (10,000 sf floor area ÷ 20,000 sf lot
area).
3.5.4 Dimensional Standards for Lots
No permit for development shall be issued for a lot that does not meet the lot area
requirements of Table 3-3, Dimensional Standards, except for Nonconforming Lots of
Record, developments subject to use patterns, or developments subject to maximum
density in lieu of minimum lot size requirements (see Table 3-3, Column C).
3.5.5 Dimensional Standards for Structures
See §§3.5.5 through 3.5.14.
3.5.6 Setbacks, Generally
Comment: Setbacks are the required distance between the lot line or right of way and
structures. Yards are the areas within the setbacks. See Appendix A for definitions.
3.5.6.1 Building setbacks for each zoning district are set forth in Table 3-3,
Dimensional Standards.
3.5.6.2 Setbacks for buildings or structures are measured as the distance between
the furthest vertical wall plane of a principal structure and the property line of the lot on
which the structure is located, except as modified by the standards of this section.
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-26
3.5.6.3 Where a yard abuts a street, the setback shall be measured from the
abutting street right of way line. Whenever a lot abuts upon a service lane or an alley,
one-half (1/2) of the service lane or alley width may be considered as a portion of the
required yard provided that the resulting setback is no less than three (3) feet from the
property line. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
Comment: Typically, the side and rear setback is measured from the property line, while
the front setback is measured from the right of way because the front yard adjoins the
street.
3.5.6.4 Setbacks shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as
specified in this section.
3.5.6.5 Whenever more than one (1) principal building is to be located on a lot,
required front, side and rear setbacks shall be maintained around the group of buildings
from all property lines as required by Table 3-3, Dimensional Standards. Buildings shall
be separated internally by a horizontal distance of not less than one and one-half (1.5)
times the amount of the required side setback. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
3.5.7 Front Setbacks
3.5.7.1 The minimum or maximum front setback may be adjusted for any lot where
the average established front setback on developed lots located within two hundred (200)
feet on each side of such lot, and fronting on the same street as such lot, is less or more
than the minimum or maximum required setback. In such cases, the minimum or maximum
front setback on such a lot may be less or more than the required front setback, but shall
not vary by more than three (3) feet from the average of the existing front setbacks on the
developed lots within two hundred (200) feet of each side. Where the applicant requests
an adjustment in the front setback, the applicant shall provide the average setback
measurements based upon public records or actual measurements. Where the Director
requires an adjustment in the maximum front setback, such information shall be provided
by the Director. The Director is also authorized, but not required, to provide data pertaining
to the average setback for designated areas of the city for purposes of this section.
3.5.7.2 Where a lot fronts on two (2) non-intersecting streets, or two (2) intersecting
streets forming an angle of sixty (60) degrees or less, front yards setbacks shall be
provided on both streets.
3.5.7.3 Where a principal use building or structure is oriented to face away from
the street on which it fronts, said building or structure shall conform to the required front
yard setback from the street for the district in which it is located. Any accessory use(s)
prohibited from required front yards within such districts are prohibited within the required
front yard setback from a principal use building or structure facing away from the street.
(Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
3.5.7.4 Where a frontage is divided among districts with different front yard
requirements, the deepest front yard applies to the entire frontage.
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-27
3.5.7.5 No structure other than a driveway, sign, fence, gate, sidewalk or berm
shall be erected or permitted to be located in a required front yard area.
3.5.7.6 The maximum front setback specified in Column J of Table 3-3,
Dimensional Standards, may be adjusted by the Planning Commission for major
subdivision applications and the Director for minor subdivision applications on corner and
cul-de-sac lots and pursuant to Note h to Table 14-2, Street Design Criteria. Front
setbacks shall not be adjusted to allow solely for adequate parking pads in front setbacks.

North Augusta Development Code 3-28
Notes to Table 3-3: (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
Generally the requirements for the parameters set forth in Columns B through L, above,
relate to the zoning district specified in the row under Column A. A  indicates that the
requirement does not apply within the particular zoning district. Fractions shall be rounded
up.
a. Column B: Minimum lot size requirements do not apply to conservation subdivisions
or TNDs, or to patio homes, duplexes, rowhouses, townhouses, apartments or any
other multifamily dwelling units. The minimum lot size figures are expressed in square
feet, unless otherwise indicated. Additional rules of interpretation for minimum lot area
are set forth in §3.5.4.
b. Column C: The maximum density requirements are expressed in dwelling units per
gross acre. Additional rules of interpretation are set forth in §3.5.
c. Columns D and E: The floor area ratio and impervious surface ratio are maximums
and are expressed as a ratio (See Appendix A, Definitions).
d. Columns F  K: The dimensions specified in Columns F through K are expressed in
feet. Rules of interpretation for setback and height requirements are set forth in §3.5.
Where a zero side setback is permitted it is intended for the creation of a common wall
with a structure on the adjacent parcel. If a zero setback is not used the minimum
setback shall be five (5) feet.
e. Column L: For the GC and TC districts, the rear setback may be reduced to ten (10)
feet if the building has access from an alley or service lane, or if no rear access is
required for loading or vehicular access.
3.5.8 Corner Side Yards
3.5.8.1 Where a side yard abuts a street (corner lot), the minimum side yard shall
be at least fifty percent (50%) of the front yard required on the lot lying to the rear when
the rear lot faces the side street. No accessory building on the corner lot shall extend
beyond the side yard lines. This section does not apply to the TND District.
3.5.8.2 Where a side yard abuts a street (corner lot), and the rear lot faces the
opposite street, and in fact constitutes another corner lot, then the side yard setback for
the district in which the lot is located shall prevail. This section does not apply to the TND
District.
3.5.8.3 Accessory uses or accessory structures, other than fences, shall not be
located in a side yard subject to §§3.5.8.1 or 3.5.8.2.
3.5.9 Setback Encroachments
The following structures within the limits set forth may project into required yards:
3.5.9.1 Any buttress, chimney, cornice or pier may extend into a setback not more
than two (2) feet.
3.5.9.2 Overhanging roofs, eaves, gutters, cornices, awnings and other
architectural detail features, other than steps, stoops and porches described in §3.5.9.3
and door hoods and overhangs described in §3.5.9.4, may extend up to four (4) feet into
the front setback and up to two (2) inches per foot of side yard into the side setback and
up to two (2) inches per foot of rear yard into the rear setback provided that in no
circumstance may the distance from the encroachment to the property line be less than
three (3) feet.
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-29
3.5.9.3 Unenclosed steps, stoops and porches, either covered or uncovered, no

the distance from the encroachment to the property line be less than three (3) feet.
3.5.9.4 A protective hood or overhang over a doorway may extend not more than
three (3) feet into the side or rear setback or no more than four (4) feet into the front
setback provided that in no circumstance may the distance from the encroachment to the
property line be less than three (3) feet.
3.5.9.5 Bay windows, awnings and other structural overhangs may extend not
more than three (3) feet into the side or rear setback or more than four (4) feet into the
front setback provided that in no circumstance may the distance from the encroachment
to the property line be less than three (3) feet.
3.5.9.6 Open fire escapes and handicap ramps for both existing and new buildings
may extend not more than four (4) feet into any required setback.
3.5.9.7 Heating and cooling units may extend not more than three (3) feet into any

provided in §4.3.4. (Adopt. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
3.5.9.12 Accessory buildings and uses customarily incidental to the permitted
primary use or building are allowed in accordance with §4.2, Accessory Structures and
Uses.
3.5.10 Height of Buildings and/or Structures
3.5.10.1 Height shall be measured as the vertical distance from grade plane to the
average height of the highest roof surface. For purposes of this section, the grade plane
means a reference plane representing the average of finished ground level adjoining the
building at its exterior walls. Where the finished ground level slopes away from the exterior
walls, the reference plane shall be established by the lowest points within the area
between the building and the lot line or, where the lot line is more than
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-30
six (6) feet from the building, between the building and a point six (6) feet from the building.
3.5.10.2 Irrespective of the height limits prescribed in Table 3-3, Dimensional
Standards, the following height limits shall apply to freestanding structures not intended
for human occupancy as listed in Table 3-4, Exceptions to Height Limitations.

3.5.13 Flag Lots
3.5.13.1 Not more than the following number of Flag Lots may be authorized to allow
for the more efficient use of irregularly shaped parcels of land, or where the integrated
nature of multiple buildings on a site dictates the need for such lots. Flag Lots may be
used to better use irregularly shaped properties or sites with physical limitations. Flag Lots
shall not be permitted where they will increase the number of lots that take their access
from collector or arterial streets.

A B
Size of Subdivision Maximum Number or Percentage (%) of Flag Lots
1. 10 or fewer lots 1 lot
2. 11 or more lots 10% of the total lots
3.5.13.2 The minimum frontage at the right of way line of the Flag Lot shall be fifteen
(15) feet. The width of the flagpole between the right of way and the lot shall be no less
than fifteen (15) feet at any point.
3.5.13.3 The area of the flagpole portion of the lot(s) shall not be considered in
determining the area of any lot.
3.5.13.4 Wherever possible Flag Lots shall share the same flagpole and driveway
through a shared access agreement.
3.5.13.5 In no event shall the length of the flagpole of a Flag Lot exceed one hundred
fifty (150) feet
3.5.13.6 The minimum driveway width shall be ten (10) feet for driveways serving
one (1) Flag Lot and twelve (12) feet for driveways serving more than one (1) lot.
3.5.13.7 Notwithstanding the provisions above, no more than three (3) lots may be
served by a flagpole driveway.
3.5.14 Zero Lot Line Units
3.5.14.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to provide reasonable design standards for detached single
family dwelling development with zero lot lines. In a zero lot line development, houses are
shifted to one side of the lot. This provides for greater usable yard space on each lot.
These developments require that planning for all house locations in a subdivision are done
at the same time. Because the exact location of each house is predetermined, greater
flexibility in site development standards is possible while assuring that the single-family
detached character of a neighborhood is maintained.
3.5.14.2 Applicable Standards
Zero lot line homes shall conform to the standards contained in this section and all other
applicable standards in this Chapter.
3.5.14.3 Overhang Easement Required
The eaves on the side of a house with a reduced setback may project a maximum of
eighteen (18) inches over the adjacent property line. In this case, an easement for the
eave projection shall be recorded on the deed for the lot where the projection occurs.
3.5.14.4 Maintenance Easement Required
An easement to allow for maintenance or repair shall be provided when the eaves or side
wall of a house are within four (4) feet of the adjacent property line. The easement on the
adjacent property shall provide at least five (5) feet of unobstructed space
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-32
between the furthermost projections of the structure and be wide enough to allow five (5)
feet between the eaves or side wall and the edge of the easement.
3.5.14.5 Side Wall Windows
If the side wall of the house is on the property line, or less than three (3) feet from the
property line, windows or other openings that allow for visibility into the side yard of the
adjacent lot are not permitted. Windows that do not allow visibility into the side yard of the
adjacent lot, such as a clerestory window or a semi-transparent or opaque window, are
allowed provided they are permitted by the International Building Code.
3.5.14.6 Minimum Distance between Structures
In no case shall the reduced setbacks result in a distance of less than ten (10) feet
between residential structures.
3.5.14.7 Setbacks Delineated
The reduced setbacks shall be clearly denoted on the preliminary subdivision plan and
final plat.
3.6 SPECIAL DISTRICTS
3.6.1 PD, Planned Development District
3.6.1.1 Purpose  The purpose of the PD District is to encourage flexibility in the
development of land in order to promote its appropriate use; to improve the design,
character and quality of new development; to facilitate the provision of streets and utilities;
and to preserve the natural and scenic features of open space. This district is intended for
use in the undeveloped areas of the city where planned development offers a superior
response to less coordinated single-lot development, as permitted elsewhere in this
Chapter.
3.6.1.2 Area and Ownership  In order to qualify as a PD District a project request
shall meet the following requirements:
3.6.1.2.1 The site shall be in single ownership or control, or if in several ownerships,
the application for amendment to this Chapter shall be filed jointly by all of the owners.
3.6.1.2.2 The site shall contain not less than ten (10) acres.
3.6.1.2.3 The proposed development shall be consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan.
3.6.1.2.4 The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed development
accomplishes the objectives of §1.2 of this Chapter to a greater extent than land
developed under any other zoning district, including a base zoning district or a TND
District.
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-33
3.6.1.3 Procedures  The creation of a PD District designation is a process
involving both a rezoning and General Development Plan approval. (Rev. 8-16-10; Ord.
2010-12)
3.6.1.3.1 A PD District may be established on the Official Zoning Map in the manner
prescribed in §3.2 only after a General Development Plan that complies with the provisions
of §5.7 of the Chapter has been reviewed by the Planning Commission, submitted to the
City Council with a Planning Commission recommendation and approved by the City
Council. Approval by the City Council must be in the form of an ordinance that approves
the General Development Plan and applies the PD zoning designation to the property.
Parcels of land that were zoned PD prior to the effective date of this section and for which
a General Development Plan has been approved may continue to be developed in
accordance with the approved plan. A major modification to a previously approved PD
General Development Plan will require compliance with the mixed use provisions of
§3.6.1.4. Parcels of land that were zoned PD prior to the effective date of this section and
for which a General Development Plan has not been approved will retain the PD district
zoning designation. Such PD zoned property may not be developed until a General
Development Plan for such PD zoned property has been submitted in compliance with
§3.6.1.4 and approved pursuant to §5.7. Alternatively, such PD zoned property may be
rezoned to a different zoning district in accordance with the provisions of §5.3 and
developed pursuant to the applicable procedures and approvals for that district. (Rev. 8-
16-10; Ord. 2010-12)
3.6.1.3.2 The General Development Plan and administrative review requirements of
this section are required after a map amendment is approved. Such requirements and all
additional requirements of this section and §3.2 shall be addressed prior to the issuance
of a building or development permit. A properly approved detailed site plan or subdivision
(preliminary and final) or both shall be required prior to a request for a building or
development permit. The requirements are specified in Article 5, Approval Procedures.
3.6.1.4 Permitted Uses  A PD district is specifically intended for development
projects of housing of different types and densities and of compatible commercial uses, or
shopping centers, office parks, and mixed-use developments characterized by a unified
site design for a mixed use development. Any use included in the ordinance approving
the General Development Plan and rezoning the site to the PD District is permitted in such
district. A list of uses, hereinafter the PD Use List, including the types of uses, type and
number of residential dwelling units and planned square footage of nonresidential uses
within a particular PD District, shall be included in the ordinance approving the General
Development Plan as part of the regulations applying to the district. (Rev. 8-16-10; Ord.
2010-12)
3.6.1.5 Private Streets  Private streets may be permitted in an approved PD
District provided such streets meet the design and construction standards of public streets
(see Article 14, Streets).
3.6.1.6 Criteria and Development Standards
3.6.1.6.1 Overall site design shall be harmonious in terms of landscaping, enclosure
of principal and accessory uses, sizes of structures, street patterns, and use
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-34
relationships. A variety in building types, heights, facades, setbacks and size of open
spaces shall be encouraged.
3.6.1.6.2 Permitted uses within a PD District are not subject to the restrictions of §3.4
or the Use Matrix, Table 3-2. However, the ordinance rezoning the tract and approving the
General Development Plan shall include the PD Use List, a list of uses from the Use Matrix
that are the only uses permitted in the specific PD District. The definition of uses included
in the Use Matrix shall be used to interpret the PD Use List, unless a different definition is
provided in the PD Use List. (Rev. 8-16-10; Ord. 2010-12)
3.6.1.6.3 The land uses within a PD District shall not be subject to any of the
dimensional or density provisions of §3.5. Dimensional standards shall conform to the
following, unless a different standard is included in the PD District rezoning ordinance:
a. Maximum height is forty-five (45) feet, except where otherwise permitted by the
Comprehensive Plan.
b. Maximum gross density is twenty-four (24) residential units per gross acre.
c. The maximum floor area ratio for non-residential uses is two point four (2.4). A
minimum of ten percent (10%) and a maximum of seventy percent (70%) of the total
project floor area shall be reserved for non-residential uses. For purposes of this
Chapter, semi-detached and two-family dwelling units are presumed to have two
thousand (2,000) square feet of floor area unless the specific dimensions are known
at the time that the PD District rezoning is approved.
d. The maximum Impervious Surface Ratio is sixty percent (60%) of the total site area.
3.6.1.6.4 Open space, parks, and recreation shall comprise a minimum of twentyfive
percent (25%) of the total site area. Portions of street rights of way that include street
trees, sidewalks, and landscaped areas may be counted toward meeting open space
requirements.
3.6.1.6.5 PD District zoning is intended to permit flexibility in the design, construction,
and processing of mixed use developments of a quality that could not be achieved by
complying with the design and development standards of another zoning district.
Therefore, the design elements as set forth in Table 3-6 shall be adhered to in the design
of a Planned Development and shall be used in the citys review of proposed PD District
projects. (Rev. 8-16-10; Ord. 2010-12)
3.6.1.6.6 In addition to the requirements of Article 12, Parking, areas designated for
parking shall be physically separated from public streets and shall be designed in a
manner conducive to safe ingress and egress. Access points to internal public streets or
internal circulation drives should be no more than three hundred (300) feet apart.
3.6.1.6.7 In addition to the requirements of Article 10, Landscaping, buffer yards or
landscaping may be required by the Planning Commission between uses within any PD
District or along the perimeter of a PD District.
3.6.1.6.8

3.6.5 R-MH, Manufactured Housing and Mobile Home District
3.6.5.1 Purpose  The purpose of this district is to provide housing alternatives in
the way of manufactured housing or mobile home subdivisions, and to insure quality
development of such projects consistent with the citys prevailing residential
characteristics. This district shall function as a "floating zone" wherein the district is
described and set forth in the text below but shall be unmapped. A property owner may
petition for the zone to be applied to a particular parcel meeting the minimum zoning
district area requirements of this Chapter through legislative action of the City Council.
Comment: Manufactured Homes are factory-built homes that comply with the National
Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards, known as the HUD Code.
Mobile Homes are factory built homes that do not conform to the HUD Code or the local
building code, typically because they were manufactured prior to adoption of the HUD
Code in 1976. Modular Homes are factory-built homes that comply with the local building
code rather than the HUD Code. See the detailed definitions of these terms in Appendix
A. Standard Manufactured Homes are permitted only in the R-MH Zoning District.
3.6.5.2 Manufactured housing or mobile home parks in the R-MH, Manufactured
Home Residential District, shall conform to the following standards in addition to those set
forth in Articles 4 through 16:
3.6.5.2.1 The following uses are permitted within an R-MH, Manufactured Home
Residential District:
a. Manufactured homes.
b. Mobile homes within parks or subdivisions.
c. Any use permitted within an R-7 district.
3.6.5.3 No more than one (1) dwelling unit shall occupy one (1) lot.
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-40
3.6.5.4 Manufactured homes and mobile homes shall have their wheels and
tongue removed upon arrival to the site and may not be occupied until the wheels and
tongue have been removed.
3.6.5.5 Manufactured units or mobile homes shall be placed on a permanent
foundation with all utilities (underground) already in place for each dwelling unit. The
perimeter of the units shall be screened with permanent landscaping or fencing material
consistent with the standards for building landscaping in Article 10, Landscaping. The units
shall be anchored to the site in a manner approved by the city to protect against accidental
movement.
3.6.5.6 Parking spaces shall be paved, properly marked, and lighted.
3.6.5.7 Concrete curbs shall be installed at the end of all "head-in" parking spaces.
3.6.5.8 All roadways shall have a minimum travel width of twenty (20) feet
exclusive of parking.
3.6.5.9 A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the park site gross acreage shall be
reserved and developed for recreational purposes. No recreation area shall be smaller
than one-half (½) acre.
3.6.5.10 Accessory uses shall be limited to park offices, laundromats, meeting halls
or activity centers, recreation facilities and maintenance buildings. Lots occupied by
individual units may include one (1) accessory structure provided it is located behind the
front elevation of the principal structure on the lot and a setback of three (3) feet is
maintained on the side and rear.
3.6.5.11 Home occupations are permitted only within the dwelling units occupying
each lot or dwelling site.

3.8.4.1 Purpose and Findings  The G, Georgia Avenue Overlay District, is
designed for that portion of the D, Downtown Mixed Use District, that contains the heart
of traditional commercial activity in North Augusta. This overlay is created with an
emphasis on maintaining the integrity of the traditional storefront building facades to
facilitate a mixture of uses, including residential, coordinating parking design and access,
and encouraging greater pedestrian activity and use. (Rev. 6-20-16; Ord. 2016-14)
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-43
FIGURE 3-2 GEORGIA AVENUE
Georgia Avenue is the focal point of economic and pedestrian activity within the Town
Center. Accordingly, a high level of community design is required in order to preserve and
to provide a unique, signature gateway into the City, to facilitate the creation of a
convenient, attractive and harmonious community, to reduce vehicular congestion by
encouraging pedestrian trips, and to encourage economic development activity. The
district standards bring pedestrian destinations close to the street, provide an interesting
environment, and provide a scale appropriate to the speed of persons traveling by foot.
The Georgia Avenue Overlay District furthers the following public purposes:
a. To protect the unique appearance and character of Georgia Avenue and promote
linkages between public, retail, residential, civic and service uses;
b. To support and increase pedestrian activity by establishing a uniform build-to line,
ground floor retail uses and storefront shopping at the street level;
c. To provide opportunities for promoting the historic diversity of land uses within the
district;
d. To encourage both commercial and residential infill development by providing relief
from parking, transportation capacity and landscaping standards applicable to other
parts of the City;
e. To encourage residential uses as a part of the redevelopment and renovation of
existing structures;
f. To provide for urban design features such as lighting, coordinated signage, street
furniture and landscaping to provide visual cues that tie the district together;
g. To ensure architectural compatibility and aesthetic harmony of structures located
within the overlay; and
h. To assure respect for the character, integrity, and quality of the built environment of
Georgia Avenue without stifling compatible innovative architecture or beneficial
economic development. (Rev. 6-20-16; Ord. 2016-14)
3.8.4.2 Applicability  This section applies to any lot or parcel within the G,
Georgia Avenue Overlay Corridor District as designated on the Official Zoning Map. No
building permit shall be issued for development on a lot or parcel within the G District
unless the proposed use, establishment or building complies with the standards described
in this section.
3.8.4.3 Permitted Uses  Within the G, Georgia Avenue Overlay District, all uses
permitted in the underlying D, Downtown Mixed Use District are permitted subject to the

d. For purposes of this section, abandon or abandonment means discontinuance of
the nonconforming use regardless of the property owners intent to relinquish the right
to so use the property. A nonconforming use is considered abandoned when:
e. It has been intentionally discontinued, remains idle or unused;
f. Necessary utilities, such as water, sewer or electricity have been discontinued for any
reason including a failure to pay fees, rates or other required charges lawfully

structure at the front setback line. (Example: A parcel that is 200 feet in length requires a
building or combination of buildings that total no less than 60 (sixty) feet in length and is
set back from the street the minimum setback, either 5 (five) feet or 30 (thirty) feet, but not
more than the maximum set back of 90 (ninety) feet.) (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
3.8.5.3.3 Where an existing building is located on a parcel and the site development
plan includes the utilization of the existing building as a principal structure, the existing
setback may be provided. The front setback landscaping requirements specified in this
section shall be applied for the provision that most closely matches the existing setback.
3.8.5.3.4 Where a parcel in the Highway Corridor is a through lot that fronts on two

3.8.6 NP, Neighborhood Preservation Corridor Overlay District
3.8.6.1 Purpose  The Neighborhood Preservation Corridor Overlay District
applies to areas of the city that are located on collector and arterial streets and are in
transition between traditional residential and commercial uses. Structures in the corridor
are predominantly if not exclusively residential in character. Parcel size is relatively small.
The underlying zoning in the corridor includes a variety of both commercial and residential
districts. The continued residential use of some parcels may not be economically feasible.
It is anticipated that conversion of single-family residences to commercial and office
establishments will continue. Demolition of existing residential structures is inconsistent
with policies expressed in the Comprehensive Plan and contemporary commercial
development for new retail uses and office buildings is inappropriate. New high-density
residential development is also inappropriate. Alternative uses of existing residential
buildings provides a more orderly and reasonable transition for the surrounding
neighborhood. With appropriate restrictions, the conversion of houses to office and small
personal service uses is suitable and provides for economically feasible uses of parcels
in the corridor. This overlay is, therefore, created with an emphasis on preserving the
residential character of the corridors, protecting the unique design features and local
architecture vernacular, and protecting the property values and health, safety and general
welfare of surrounding neighborhoods. The Neighborhood Preservation Corridor Overlay
District is established to preserve and protect residential neighborhoods while
accommodating some transitional commercial uses at an appropriate scale in locations
zoned for commercial uses. It is the intent of the Neighborhood Preservation Overlay
Corridor District to maintain the residential appearance of existing structures and the
residential setting of any building converted to a nonresidential use so that the converted
dwelling will be compatible with neighboring residential property. To maintain residential
character, lots shall not be developed or redeveloped solely for the purpose of providing
parking.
3.8.6.2 Permitted Uses  Uses permitted in the Neighborhood Preservation
Corridor Overlay District are provided in Table 3-2, Use Matrix, for the underlying base
district. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
3.8.6.2.1 Permitted nonresidential uses may be located on the first floor only. Upper
stories may be used for residential and accessory storage uses only. Parking is not
permitted as a principal use.
3.8.6.2.2 Uses that are not permitted are:
a. Drive-in, drive-up and drive-through facilities;
b. Indoor or outdoor sales of equipment, motorcycles or automobiles;
c. Gasoline sales and automobile service stations; or
d. Automobile and motorcycle repair.
3.8.6.2.3 No use which requires a special exception is permitted.
3.8.6.2.4 No use may be established unless and until it complies with the standards
established in this section and other applicable standards contained in this Chapter.
3.8.6.2.5 No existing structure may be demolished until a site plan for the parcel has
been approved. If the demolition of an existing structure is anticipated an evaluation of the
ARTICLE 3  ZONING DISTRICTS
North Augusta Development Code 3-61
economic feasibility of retaining, renovating or expanding the structure for the intended
use shall be completed and submitted with the site plan application.
3.8.6.3 Dimensional Standards 
3.8.6.3.1 The dimensional standards for the Neighborhood Preservation Corridor
Overlay District are established in Table 3-12.
3.8.6.3.2 Where an existing building is located on a parcel and the site development
plan includes the utilization of the existing building as a principal structure, one existing
driveway from the corridor street may be utilized regardless of location or width. (Adopt.

4.3 FENCES AND WALLS
4.3.1 Purpose
This section establishes standards for walls and fences that are erected where desirable
for privacy, screening, separation, security, erosion control, or to serve other necessary
and reasonable functions. The standards are designed to ensure that the design and
materials used are functional and compatible with existing and proposed site architecture.
The fence standards promote the positive benefits of fences without negatively impacting
the community or endangering public or vehicle safety. Fences can create a sense of
privacy, protect children and pets, provide separation from busy streets, and enhance the
appearance of property by providing attractive landscape materials. The negative effects
of fences can include the creation of street walls that inhibit police and community
surveillance, decrease the sense of community, hinder emergency access, hinder the safe
movement of pedestrians and vehicles, and create an unattractive appearance. These
standards are intended to promote the positive aspects of fences and to limit the negative
ones.
4.3.2 Applicability
This section applies to walls, fences, and screens of all types whether open, solid, wood,
metal, wire, masonry, or other material constructed in a required setback anywhere in the
city.Walls or fences that are not located in required building setbacks may be constructed
to the height of the principal structure at the eaves shall be constructed of a material that
is similar to or consistent with the architectural design of the building or structure and
approved by the Director.
4.3.3 Location
Any required yard.
ARTICLE 4  SUPPLEMENTAL USE REGULATIONS
North Augusta Development Code 4-6
4.3.4 Setbacks
No setback is required in side and rear yards adjacent to another property. In front yards
and side yards adjacent to a street a fence or wall may be constructed at the back of the
sidewalk provided it is not located within any right of way.Where no sidewalk exists, a wall
or fence must be set back not less than eighteen (18) inches from the public right of way.
4.3.5 Maximum Height
a. Fences up to four (4) feet high are allowed in required front yard setbacks, in areas of

5.1 GENERALLY
5.1.1 General Procedural Requirements
5.1.1.1 Common Elements 
5.1.1.1.1 This section describes the basic procedural elements common to all
development applications. Generally, the procedure for all applications includes five (5)
common elements:
a. Submittal of a complete application, including required fee payments and appropriate
information;
b. Review of the submittal by appropriate staff, agencies and boards;
c. Action to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application;
d. Appeals; and
e. Notification of approval or denial including a description of the actions authorized by
the permit and the time period for exercising rights under the order or permit.
5.1.1.1.2 This section describes procedural steps common to all development
applications. Sections 5.2 through 5.9 describe the unique procedural steps for
processing certain types of applications. Each section relating to procedure provides the
following information:
a. Initiation: This section describes how the application for the permit is filed.
b. Completeness Review: This section describes the process for determining whether
sufficient information has been submitted in order to process an application. This
includes the required fee payment and appropriate information. A determination that
an application is complete does not constitute a determination as to whether the
application complies with the standards for approval of the application.
c. Decision: This section describes the procedures for review of the submittal by
appropriate staff, board, commission, council, agency or body (hereinafter referred to
as agency), and for reaching a decision as to whether the permit is approved,
denied, or approved with conditions.
d. Approval Criteria: This section lists any criteria for approval of the particular
application. These criteria supplement any other criteria required by this Chapter for
approval of the application.
e. Subsequent Applications: This section provides a waiting period for some
applications in order to avoid consuming resources on the processing of repetitive
applications.
f. Scope of Approval: This section indicates the rights that an applicant obtains from
approval or conditional approval of an application, and what actions the permit
authorizes and the time period for exercising rights under the order or permit.
g. Recording Procedures: This section describes how the decision on the application is
recorded in the public records.
5.1.1.2 Categories of Permits  There are three (3) basic categories of permits
and/or development orders pursuant to this Chapter. These categories are defined as
follows:
a. Legislative Development Orders: Legislative development orders involve a change in
land use policy by the City Council. A public hearing is required, but the procedural
requirements of a quasi-judicial hearing do not apply. Examples include text
amendments and rezonings.
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-4
b. Quasi-Judicial Decisions: A quasi-judicial decision involves the application of a
standard required by this Chapter to an application. Some of the applications require
a public hearing. Procedural due process requirements apply as established in
§5.1.4. Examples include variances, special exception permits, appeals, adjustments
and waivers.
c. Ministerial Permits: Ministerial permits involve the application of the standards of this
Chapter to an application by an administrative agency. A public hearing is not
required. A ministerial permit typically occurs late in the development approval
process. Examples include certificates of zoning compliance, site plans, major
subdivision plans, major and minor final plats, conditional use permits, building
permits and certificates of occupancy.
5.1.1.3 Building Permits Required  No building or structure shall be erected,
added to, or structurally altered within the city limits until a permit therefore has been
issued by the Superintendent of Building Standards. All applications for building permits
shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter. No building permit, certificate of
zoning compliance or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any building where the
construction, addition, or alteration or use thereof violates any provision of this Chapter,
except upon written order specifying the approval of a variance, waiver or adjustment by
the Board of Zoning Appeals, Planning Commission or Director as the case may warrant
and as authorized in this Chapter.
5.1.1.4 Certificates of Occupancy  All uses, including nonconforming uses,
shall obtain a certificate of occupancy as required by the International Building Code.
The Superintendent of Building Standards shall maintain a record of all certificates of
occupancy and copies shall be furnished, upon request, to any person having a
proprietary or tenancy interest in the property affected.
5.1.2 Completeness Review
The procedures for completeness review apply to every application, unless otherwise
provided in the provisions pertaining to the regulations for the specific application or
permit.
5.1.2.1 Pre-Application Conference 
a. For the purpose of expediting applications and reducing development costs, the
developer may request a pre-application conference for a subdivision plat, site plan,
rezoning or general development plan. The pre-application conference shall allow
the applicant to meet with appropriate city representatives. The individuals, or their
designees, who should participate include:
1. Director of Economic and Community Development;
2. City Engineer;
3. City Administrator
4. Superintendent of Building Standards;
5. Fire Marshal;
6. Director of Public Safety;
7. Director of Public Works and Utilities;
8. Other city staff invited to participate may include the Director of Parks,
Recreation and Leisure Services; members of the planning staff; Stormwater
Manager; Superintendent of Property Maintenance; and others as may be
necessary; and
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-5
9. Representatives of private utilities that may be interested in or affected by an
application.
b. Applicants seeking a pre-application conference shall submit the information in
Appendix B, Application Documents, ten (10) days prior to the pre-application
conference.
1. If requested and paid for by the applicant, a brief written summary of the preapplication
conference shall be provided within ten (10) working days of the final
pre-application conference.
2. The applicant may be charged reasonable fees for a pre-application conference.
3. The applicant shall not be bound by the determination of the pre-application
conference, nor shall the Planning Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals be
bound by any such review.
5.1.2.2 Sketch Plan 
a. In addition to the pre-application conference, at the request of the applicant
subsequent to the pre-application conference, the Planning Commission may grant
an informal review of a sketch or concept plan for a development for which the
applicant intends to prepare and submit an application for development. The
purpose of the sketch plan review process is to provide the Planning Commission
input in the formative stages of a development plan.
b. Applicants seeking sketch plan review shall submit the items stipulated in Appendix
B, Application Documents, ten (10) days before the Planning Commission meeting at
which the sketch plan will be reviewed. These items provide the applicant and
Planning Commission with an opportunity to discuss the development proposal in its
formative stages.
c. A brief written summary of the sketch plan review shall be provided within ten (10)
working days of the sketch plan review meeting.
d. The applicant may be charged reasonable fees for the sketch plan review.
e. The Planning Commission may make specific recommendations regarding the
proposed development including the implementation of a citizen participation process
(§5.1.7) prior to submitting the development application.
f. The applicant shall not be bound by any sketch plan for which review is requested,
nor shall the Planning Commission be bound by any such review.
5.1.2.3 Application Materials 
a. No application shall be deemed complete unless all of the information required by
Appendix B, Application Documents, is included, and all required filing fees have
been paid. An application which includes all such information shall be deemed
complete.
b. Current application forms and information shall be made available in the Department
offices and on the citys website. Such applications shall be filed in advance of any
public hearing or public meeting required pursuant to this Chapter or statute. The
Director may establish a schedule for filing any application requiring action by the
Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the City Council, which schedule
shall provide adequate time for notice and/or publication consistent with the
applicable state statutes and this Chapter.
5.1.2.4 Review Procedures  The following procedures shall be used to review
any application for completeness unless a different procedure is established elsewhere
in this Chapter. For the purposes of this section, the term Department shall mean the
Department of Economic and Community Development. The term Director shall include
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-6
any administrative official with original jurisdiction to review an application for
completeness, and the phrase Appellate Agency shall include any agency, board or
commission with jurisdiction to review any decision of the administrative official for
completeness.
a. Jurisdiction: Unless the provisions pertaining to a particular application or
development order or permit prescribe otherwise:
1. All applications for approval of a development order or a permit shall be reviewed
by the Director for completeness.
2. All decisions of the Director or other administrative official pertaining to
completeness may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals in the case of a
rezoning, conditional zoning, variance, special exception, adjustment to an
architectural design standard or appeal from an administrative decision (general
or building design) application, or the Planning Commission for all other
applications.
b. Time Limits Triggered by Complete Application: Whenever this Chapter establishes a
time period for the processing of an application by the city, such time period shall not
commence until the Director or his designee has reviewed such application for
completeness in order to determine whether the application has been properly
submitted and the applicant has corrected all deficiencies in such application. The
review for completeness of application forms and information is solely for the
purpose of determining whether preliminary information required for submission with
the application is sufficient to allow further processing, and shall not constitute a
decision as to whether application complies with this Chapter.
c. Review by Director and Appeal  Default Procedure
1. Unless a different procedure is described in this Chapter, this section shall apply
to the review of an application for completeness.
2. Not later than fifteen (15) working days after the Director has received an
application, the Director shall determine in writing whether the application is
complete and shall immediately transmit the determination to the applicant. If the
written determination is not made within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the
application, the application shall be deemed complete for purposes of this
Chapter. If the application is determined not to be complete, the Director's
determination shall specify those parts of the application which are incomplete
and shall indicate the manner in which they can be made complete, including a
list and thorough description of the specific information needed to complete the
application. The applicant shall submit materials to the Director in response to
the list and description. Upon receipt of any resubmittal of the application, a new
five (5) day period shall begin, during which period the Director shall determine
the completeness of the application.
3. If the application together with the submitted information and related materials
are determined not to be complete, the applicant may appeal the decision in
writing to the Appellate Agency. The Appellate Agency shall hear the appeal not
later than the next available meeting after receipt of the applicant's written
appeal. The Appellate Agency shall render a written determination on the appeal
within five (5) days following the hearing. If the written determination is not made
within ten (10) days after the hearing the appeal, the application shall be deemed
complete for purposes of this Chapter.
4. Nothing in this section precludes an applicant and the Director from mutually
agreeing to an extension of any time limit provided by this section.
d. Time Limits: If a time limit other than that prescribed above is prescribed for a
determination of completeness for a specific application for development approval
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-7
and the Department of the reviewing agency fails to act within the specified time
period, the application shall be deemed complete.
e. Limitation on Further Information Requests: After the Director accepts an application
as complete or following a determination by the Appellate Agency that the application
is complete, the Director or the reviewing agency shall not subsequently request of
an applicant any new or additional information which was not specified in Appendix
B, Application Documents. The Director or the reviewing agency may, in the course
of processing the application, request the applicant to clarify, amplify, correct or
otherwise supplement the information required for the application.
This section shall not be construed as requiring an applicant to submit with his or her
initial application the entirety of the information which the Director or the reviewing
agency may require in order to take final action on the application. Prior to accepting an
application, the Director shall inform the applicant of any information included in
Appendix B, Application Documents, which will subsequently be required from the
applicant in order to complete final action on the application.
5.1.3 Notice Provisions
5.1.3.1 Generally  The notice requirements for each type of application for
development approval are prescribed in the individual subsections of this Chapter
applicable thereto or the South Carolina statutes or both. The notice requirements for
certain types of public hearings are established in the Notes to Table 5-1, Notice
Requirements, provided, however, that to the extent of any inconsistency between this
section and any state statute, the state statute shall govern.
5.1.3.2 Contents of Notice  The notice shall state the time, date and place of
hearing, a description of the application and a description of the property subject to the
application which includes, at a minimum, the following:
a. The street address or, if the street address is unassigned or unavailable, the legal
description by subdivision, lot and block, if available, and the tax parcel number;
b. The current zoning classification, if any; and
c. The category of permit or application requested, the specific sections of this Chapter
applicable to the application, and a brief description of the proposed development
including density or building intensity, revised zoning classification, if any, and uses
requested.

ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-10
5.1.4 Public Hearing Procedures
5.1.4.1 Applicability  This section applies to any application involving quasijudicial
or legislative review by the Planning Commission or the Board of Zoning
Appeals. This section does not apply to any application for a ministerial permit or
administrative approval.
5.1.4.2 Regular Meetings and Recommendation  The Planning Commission
shall hold regularly scheduled public hearings to receive and review public input on
those items required by this Chapter. On those items where it has review authority and
recommending responsibility, the Planning Commission shall recommend that the City
Council approve, approve with conditions or deny applications. If a comprehensive plan,
rezoning or other land use regulation requiring final approval of the City Council, or
amendment thereto, or other development application, has been duly submitted to the
Planning Commission, and the Planning Commission has failed to convene a quorum or
to make a recommendation approving or denying such action at two (2) consecutive
meetings, such action, at the option of the applicant, shall be deemed to be a negative
recommendation. The Director shall thereupon submit the proposed comprehensive
plan, rezoning, land use regulation or amendment thereto or other development
application to the City Council for its consideration.
5.1.4.3 Records  The Director shall provide for minutes to be written and
retained, shall record the evidence submitted within the hearing time allotted for the item
being considered, and shall include a summary of the considerations and the action of
the Planning Commission.
5.1.4.4 City Council  The City Council shall hold scheduled public hearings to
act upon all items required by this Chapter to be considered by the City Council. When a
public hearing is held by the Planning Commission on an application considered
pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, no public hearing by the City Council is
required. The City Council shall decide whether or not to approve, approve with
conditions, if applicable, or deny applications referred or recommended to it by the
Planning Commission.
5.1.4.5 Quasi-Judicial Public Hearing Procedures 
a. Generally: This section applies to any application for a variance, appeal, special
exception or any other action pursuant to this Chapter which is considered quasijudicial
under South Carolina law. In making quasi-judicial decisions, the decision
makers must ascertain the existence of facts, investigate the facts, hold hearings,
weigh evidence and draw conclusions from them, as a basis for official action, and
exercise discretion of a judicial nature. In the land use context, quasi-judicial
decisions involve the application of land use policies to individual situations, such as
variances, and appeals of administrative determinations. These decisions involve
three key elements: the finding of facts regarding the specific proposal, the exercise
of some discretion in applying the standards of the ordinance and reaching
conclusions of the applicable law in the case. Due process requirements for quasijudicial
decisions mandate that all fair trial standards be observed when these
decisions are made. This includes an evidentiary hearing with the right of the parties
to offer evidence; cross-examine adverse witnesses; inspect documents; have sworn
testimony; and have written findings of fact and conclusions supported by competent,
substantial, and material evidence.
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-11
b. Conduct of Hearing: Any person or persons may appear at a public hearing and
submit evidence, either individually or as a representative. Each person who appears
at a public hearing shall state, for the record, his or her name, address and, if
appearing on behalf of an organization or group, the name and mailing address of
the organization or group. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this subsection. At any point, members of the agency
conducting the hearing may ask questions of the applicant, staff or public. The order
of proceedings shall be as follows:
1. The Director or appropriate staff member shall present a description of the
application, appeal or proposed development and a written or oral
recommendation. The recommendation shall address each factor required by this
section to be considered prior to action or approval on the application, appeal or
proposed development permit;
2. The applicant shall present any information or evidence that the applicant deems
appropriate;
3. Public testimony shall be heard;
4. The Director or other staff member may respond to any statement made by the
applicant or any public comment;
5. The applicant may respond to any testimony or evidence presented by the staff
or public; and
6. The agency conducting the hearing shall close the public portion of the hearing
and conduct deliberations.
5.1.4.6 Legislative and Advisory Hearings  The purpose of a legislative public
hearing is to provide the public an opportunity to be heard consistent with the adoption
procedures provided by statute. Unlike quasi-judicial hearings, a legislative proceeding
does not require due process protections such as the right of the parties to offer
evidence, cross-examination, sworn testimony; or written findings of fact. Like quasijudicial
hearings, legislative hearings are public hearings preceded by notice to
interested parties. Public hearings are required for legislative review hearings such as
amendments to a comprehensive plan, amendments to this Chapter including the zoning
provisions of this Chapter and the Official Zoning Map, and applications for a Planned
Development. The order of the proceedings for a legislative hearing shall be as set forth
in §5.1.4.5.b. Testimony may be presented by any member of the public, but need not
be submitted under oath or affirmation. The Planning Commission and Board of Zoning
Appeals may establish a time limit for testimony.
5.1.4.7 Record of Proceedings  The agency conducting the hearing shall
record the minutes of the proceedings by any appropriate means as prescribed by rule
and consistent with state law. Such record shall be provided at the request of any person
upon application to the Director and payment of a fee set by the City Council to cover the
cost of duplication of the transcribed record.
5.1.5 Post-Decision Proceedings
See §18.4.5, Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
5.1.6 Revocation of Permit or Approval (Rev. 12-1-14; Ord. 2014-16)
5.1.6.1 Initiation  The Director shall investigate alleged violations of
development regulations or other provisions of this Chapter and conditions on the
approval of a development order. The Director shall provide notice to the applicant and,
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-12
if necessary, utilize the provisions of Section 5.11 to achieve compliance. If the
remedies provided in Section 5.11 are ineffectual and the Director determines that the
revocation of a development approval or permit is appropriate, a recommendation,
including the reason(s) for the determination, shall be made to the Board of Zoning
Appeals who shall conduct a public hearing on the matter at the next regular meeting
scheduled after all public notice requirements have been met.
5.1.6.2 Grounds for Revocation  The following shall be considered grounds for
revocation of a permit:
a. The intentional provision of materially misleading information by the applicant. The
provision of information is considered intentional where the applicant was aware of
the inaccuracies or could have discovered the inaccuracies with reasonable
diligence; or
b. The failure to comply with the development regulations or other provisions of this
Chapter or any condition of a development order or development permit.
5.1.6.3 Notice and Public Hearing  See S.C. Code §6-29-790 and Article 18 of
the Chapter. Said notice shall be in writing and delivered by personal service or certified
mail to the permit holder and shall inform the permit holder of the Directors
recommendation as well as the date and location of the hearing before the Board.

found have been violated, the harm such violation has caused, and the reason such
violation cannot be cured.
5.1.6.5 Effect and Appeals  A petition complaining of the Board of Zoning
Appeals decision may be presented to a court of competent jurisdiction within the time
provided by S.C. Code §6-29-820.

5.1.7 Citizen Participation Process
It is the policy of the city to encourage applicants to meet with surrounding
neighborhoods prior to filing an application for a permit approval requiring review and a
public hearing. Citizen participation will not produce complete consensus on all
applications but will permit applicants to be good neighbors and allows for informed
decision making. The level of citizen interest and area of involvement will vary
depending on the nature of the application and the location of the proposed development
site. The purposes of the citizen participation process are to:
a. Encourage applicants to pursue early and effective communications with the affected
public in conjunction with applications, giving the applicant an opportunity to educate
and inform the public of the planned project;
b. Understand and attempt to mitigate any documentable and measurable adverse
impact of the proposed project on the adjoining properties;
c. Provide citizens and property owners of affected areas with an opportunity to learn
about proposed development applications that may affect them and to work with
applicants to resolve concerns at an early stage of the process; and

invitation list for the citizen participation meeting includes the following:
a. Property owners within the public hearing notice area;
b. Neighborhood associations which include the subject property and/or are within two
hundred (200) feet of the subject property;
c. Other interested parties as determined by the applicant; and
d. Planning Commission and appropriate city staff.
5.1.7.4 Report on Citizen Participation Process  The applicant is encouraged
to provide a written report on the results of its citizen participation effort prior to filing the
application. The report will be included in the staff report on the application. At a
minimum, the citizen participation report should include the following information:
a. Details of techniques the applicant used to involve the public, including:
1. Dates and locations of all meetings where citizens were invited to discuss the
applicant's proposal;
2. Content, dates mailed and numbers of mailings, including letters, meeting

as needed in the annual budget adopted by the City Council.
5.2 ADMINISTRATIVE PERMITS
5.2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to prescribe procedures for permits which do not require
quasi-judicial or legislative notice or a public hearing.
A public hearing is not required for permits set forth in this section for one or more of
the following reasons:
a. If required, public hearings have already been conducted relating to the permit

complies with a previously approved subdivision plat, comprehensive plan
amendment or conditional rezoning (e.g., site plan).
c. The proposed use is permitted by right in the applicable zoning district (e.g., building
permit).
d. The permit is subject to unique provisions of state or federal law which restrict the
citys discretion and which require expedited review.
5.2.2 Applicability
5.2.2.1 This section shall apply subsequent to approval of any major site plan or
major subdivision as set forth in §§5.6 and 5.8. Administrative permits include:

until a certificate of zoning compliance for the proposed business activity and location
has been issued in conformity with this Chapter.
5.2.3.3 A certificate of zoning compliance may be issued by the Director upon
request for an existing use provided the use conforms with the provisions of this Chapter
or is a legally nonconforming use and no changes to the use are proposed.
5.2.3.4 Unless elsewhere exempted by this Chapter, no building, sign, parking lot
or other structure shall be erected, moved, added to or structurally altered without a
certificate of zoning compliance issued by the Director. No certificate of zoning
compliance shall be issued by the Director except in conformity with this Chapter, unless
he receives a written order from the Planning Commission or the Board of Zoning
Appeals in the form of an administrative review, variance or special exception.
5.2.4 Certificate of Occupancy
5.2.4.1 It shall be unlawful to use, or occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of
any building, or premises, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of occupancy is issued stating that the proposed use of the building or land conforms to
the requirements of this Chapter.
5.2.4.2 No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless it is signed by the
Director, Building Official, City Engineer and Fire Marshal or their designees. The
signatures shall be affixed to the document issuing the certificate of occupancy. In the
case of one (1) and two (2) family dwellings, the Building Official may sign the certificate
of occupancy for the Director, City Engineer and Fire Marshal and thereby certify that the
residence complies with all applicable regulations.
5.2.4.3 If the certificate of occupancy is denied, the applicant may appeal the
action of the official refusing to sign the permit to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (See
§18.4)
5.2.5 Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy
Uses permitted by right and uses permitted under prescribed conditions, and uses and
structures accessory thereto, shall require a building permit and a certificate of
occupancy. Changes in the use of property shall require a certificate of occupancy. A

5.2.6.2 One copy of the plans shall be returned to the applicant by the Director
after he shall have marked such copy either as approved or disapproved and attested to
same by his signature on such copy. The original copy of the plan, similarly marked,
shall be retained by the Director.
5.2.7 Construction and Use to be as Shown in Applications, Plans,
Permits and Certificates of Zoning Compliance
Certificates of zoning compliance and building permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Director authorize only the use, arrangement, and
construction set forth in such approved plans and applications. No other use,
arrangement or construction shall be allowed.
5.3 REZONINGS AND TEXT AMENDMENTS
5.3.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to establish uniform procedures for processing changes to
the Official Zoning Map ("rezoning") and for amendments to the text of this Chapter (text
amendment).
5.3.2 Applicability
This section applies to any application for an amendment to the text of this Chapter or
for an amendment to the Official Zoning Map. An amendment to the Official Zoning Map
which reclassifies property from one zoning district to another is known as a rezoning.
A change to the text of this Chapter is referred to as a text amendment.
5.3.3 Initiation
This Chapter, including the Official Zoning Map and any supporting map(s), may be
amended from time to time by the City Council, but no amendment shall become
effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall have first been submitted to the
Planning Commission for review and recommendation. Any communication purporting to
be an application for a change shall be regarded as mere notice to seek relief until it is
made in the form required. Upon receipt of any communication, the interested parties
shall be supplied with the proper application form(s) by the Director.
5.3.3.1 Rezoning  Any property owner, city board, commission, department or
the City Council may apply for a change in zoning district boundaries (rezoning),
excluding applications for conditional use districts as set forth in §5.4. An amendment to
the Official Zoning Map may be initiated by filing an application that conforms to
Appendix B, Application Documents, with the Department. The application shall be
signed and filed by the owner or, with the owners specific written consent, a contract
purchaser or owners agent of property included within the boundaries of a proposed
rezoning. Before any application is accepted by the Department, it is recommended that
the applicant meet with a representative of the Department. The purpose of the preapplication
meeting is to discuss the procedures and requirements for a rezoning
request. During the conference, the Department will identify the submittal requirements.
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-17
5.3.3.2 Text Amendment  Any person, property owner, board, commission,
department or the City Council may apply for a change in zoning ordinance text. A
proceeding for approval of a text amendment may be initiated by filing an application
with the Department. The application shall be signed by the applicant and shall include
the language of the proposed amendment to the text of this Chapter and the justification
for the proposed change. Before any application is accepted by the Department, it is
recommended that the applicant meet with a representative of the Department. The
purpose of the pre-application meeting is to discuss the procedures and requirements for
a text amendment request. During the conference, the Department will identify the
submittal requirements.
5.3.4 Completeness Review
Within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of an application, the Department shall
complete a review of the application, determine if the application is complete pursuant to
this section, and inform the applicant of the status of the completeness of the
application. If the Department determines the application is not complete, the applicant
shall be advised of the reasons for the incomplete application, the additional information
required and the schedule to complete the application process.
5.3.5 Decision
5.3.5.1 The Director shall transmit the application to the Planning Commission for
consideration at the next regularly scheduled monthly meeting following receipt of a
complete application, provided that the complete application is submitted at least thirty
(30) calendar days prior to said meeting. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided
as set forth in §5.1.3. The Planning Commission shall approve or deny the zoning
amendment in accordance with the procedures for a legislative hearing as set forth in
§5.1.4.6.
5.3.5.2 At least ten (10) days notice and opportunity to comment must be given to
the public if the applicant is allowed to present oral or written comments pursuant to S.C.
Code §6-29-760.
5.3.5.3 The Planning Commission shall submit its recommendation to the City
Council within thirty (30) calendar days, or other period required by law, after the initial
hearing date (see S.C. Code §6-29-760(A). A majority vote is required for the Planning
Commission to approve, approve with conditions, if applicable, or deny a rezoning or text
amendment application. A recommendation of approval with conditions of a rezoning
may be submitted only if a conditional use permit is requested pursuant to §5.5.
5.3.5.4 The City Council shall consider the recommendation of the Planning
Commission on each proposed rezoning and text amendment within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the Planning Commission report. The City Council is not bound by the
recommendation in making a final decision and may call for additional information and/or
public hearing(s).
5.3.5.5 No challenge to the adequacy of notice or challenge to the validity of a
rezoning or text amendment, whether enacted before or after the effective date of this
section, may be made sixty (60) days after the decision of the City Council if there has
been substantial compliance with the notice requirements of this section, with
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-18
established procedures of the City Council and the Planning Commission and with S.C.
Code §6-29.
5.3.6 Approval Criteria
Whenever the public necessity, safety or general welfare justifies such action, the
Planning Commission may recommend amendments to the text of this Chapter or
changes to zoning district boundaries. The Planning Commission shall consider all of the
factors specified in this section, at a minimum, in reviewing an application for a rezoning.
The Planning Commission shall consider the factors specified in §5.3.3.2 in reviewing an
application for a text amendment.
5.3.6.1 The size of the tract in question.
5.3.6.2 Whether the proposal conforms with and furthers the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan, other adopted plans, and the goals, objectives, and policies of this
Chapter. Specifically, the Planning Commission shall consider the goals stated in §1.2.
5.3.6.3 The relationship of the uses envisioned under the new zoning and the
uses currently present in adjacent tracts. In particular, the Planning Commission shall
consider whether:
a. The proposed rezoning is compatible with the surrounding area;
b. There will be any adverse effects on the capacity or safety of the portion of street
network influenced by the rezoning;
c. There will be any adverse effects on existing or planned public utility services in the
area;
d. Parking problems; or
e. Environmental impacts that the new use will generate such as excessive storm water
runoff, water, air, or noise pollution, excessive nighttime lighting or other nuisances.
5.3.6.4 Any recent change of character in the area due to installation of public
facilities, other zone changes, new growth trends, deterioration and development.
5.3.6.5 The zoning districts and existing land uses of the surrounding properties.
5.3.6.6 Whether the subject property is suitable for the uses to which it has been
restricted under the existing zoning classification.
5.3.6.7 Whether the rezoning is compatible with the adjacent neighborhood,
especially residential neighborhood stability and character.
5.3.6.8 The length of time the subject property has remained vacant as zoned, if
applicable.
5.3.6.9 Whether there is an adequate supply of land available in the subject area
and the surrounding community to accommodate the zoning and community needs
including, but not limited to, affordable housing and economic development.
5.3.6.10 Whether the existing zoning was in error at the time of adoption.
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-19
5.3.7 Subsequent Applications
In the event that an application for a rezoning is denied or the application is withdrawn
after the Planning Commission hearing, the Department shall refuse to accept another
application for the same amendment on the same property or any portion of the same
property within one (1) year of the original hearing. However, the Planning Commission
may consider such an application within that time period if it finds there is new and
different evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of the original hearing.
The Planning Commission or City Council may initiate a rezoning at any time without
regard to the one (1) year limitation.
5.3.8 Scope of Approval
The approval of a zoning map or text amendment does not authorize any development
activity. If the desired use is permitted as of right, the applicant may file a preliminary
subdivision plat application or a site plan application, if required by §§5.6 or 5.8. If no site
plan approval is required, an application for a certificate of zoning compliance, building
permit and any other administrative permits required by §5.2 or §13.2.3 may be
submitted.
5.3.9 Recordation
The city clerk shall maintain the legal description and accompanying map exhibit,
required by Appendix B, Application Documents, of all approved rezoning applications.
The city clerk shall maintain the record of all amendments to the text of this Chapter in
the same manner as all ordinances approved by the City Council.
5.4 CONDITIONAL ZONING
5.4.1 Purpose
The conditional zoning procedure is essentially a combination of a rezoning map
amendment and text amendment. It is designed to provide for a land use within an area
that is not permitted by the established zoning district but due to individual site
considerations or unique development requirements would be compatible with adjacent
land uses under given conditions. The granting of a conditional zoning classification shall
not be for all of the uses permitted in a district but shall be only for the specific
conditional use or uses named in the ordinance approving the conditional zoning district.
5.4.2 Applicability
This section applies to any application for reclassification of a tract, parcel or land area
to a conditional zoning district. Conditional zoning districts may be applied as parallel
districts to any of the base zoning districts. Conditional zoning districts may not be
applied to any of the special districts of Article 3, Zoning Districts.
5.4.3 Initiation
A proceeding for approval of a conditional zoning district shall be initiated by filing an
application with the Department. The application shall be signed and filed by the owner
or, with the owners specific written consent, a contract purchaser or owners agent of a
property included within the boundaries of a proposed conditional rezoning. The
applicant may submit an application for a conditional use permit concurrent with the
application for a conditional zoning district. No separate conditional use permit
application shall be required for a conditional rezoning. The application for a conditional
zoning district shall be the same as that for a rezoning.
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-20
A conditional zoning district may be granted as an amendment to an ongoing rezoning
case. Before granting this amendment, the city shall issue a notice to all affected parties
of the proposed conditional zoning district but will not require the applicant to submit a
new application or pay additional fees other than for additional notice requirements.
Such amendment shall then be considered at the next regularly scheduled Planning
Commission meeting after complying with the notice requirements or, in the case of the
City Council, at the next regularly scheduled meeting at which zoning cases will be
considered. All costs associated with issuance of the additional notice shall be borne by
the applicant.
5.4.4 Completeness Review
The Director shall conduct a completeness review as set forth in §5.1. The Appellate
Agency for purposes of completeness review shall be the Board of Zoning Appeals.
5.4.5 Decision
The procedure for approving a conditional zoning classification shall be the same as
required for a rezoning, and as further provided herein. In approving the conditional
zoning classification for recommendation to the City Council, the Planning Commission
may impose such requirements and safeguards as indicated by §5.4.6 as are necessary
to protect adjoining property, and may specifically authorize the location of uses, subject
to the requirements set forth in §5.4.6.2.
5.4.6 Criteria
5.4.6.1 Permitted Uses  Notwithstanding any provisions of this Chapter to the
contrary, a conditional zoning district may be permitted as provided in this section so
long as the criteria for approval of a rezoning are met.
5.4.6.2 Development Constraints  In considering a request for a conditional
zoning classification, the Planning Commission shall determine the use and
development conditions which ensure compatibility with surrounding properties.
Development constraints that may be specified as a requirement for a conditional zoning
classification shall be limited to the following:
a. Range of allowable uses.
b. Protective screening and/or buffering of property perimeter.
c. Protective screening/location of dumpsters, mechanical systems and loading docks.
d. Landscaping relative to screening, buffering and ingress/egress control and not
solely for beautification purposes.
e. Lighting.
f. Height limitations.
g. Setbacks.
h. Parking. The location of parking and in some instances reduction in the amount of
parking to be allowed.
i. Access, circulation, ingress and egress.
j. Hours of operation for special conditional uses permitted in, or adjacent to,
residential zoning districts.
k. Signage.
l. Performance standards relative to: air pollution, noise, glare and heat, vibration,
noxious odors, toxic and liquid wastes, fire and explosion, radioactivity and
electromagnetic radiation.
m. Building design.
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-21
5.4.6.3 Variances Prohibited  A variance shall not be granted to any
development constraint specified in this section or to any condition imposed by the
Planning Commission and included in the rezoning ordinance.
5.4.7 Subsequent Applications
The provisions of §5.4.6 shall apply to this section provided, however, that they shall
apply only to an application requesting the same conditional use or uses as the original
application.
5.4.8 Amendments
5.4.8.1 New or Different Uses  An amendment to a conditional zoning district
to authorize a new or different use shall require a new application for a rezoning to a
conditional zoning district and shall be processed as set forth in §§5.4.1 through 5.4.8.
5.4.8.2 Expansion  Expansion of the building area, land area, or intensity of the
conditional zoning classification for a property granted a conditional zoning classification
shall require an application for a new conditional zoning classification and payment of
appropriate fees. An expansion of a conditional zoning district shall be processed as a
new conditional zoning application.
5.5 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
5.5.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to establish procedures and standards for the processing
and approval of conditional use permits. Conditional use permits provide a form of
limited discretionary approval for certain uses which are generally compatible with the
land uses permitted by right in a zoning district, but which require individual review of
their location, design, and configuration. Conditional uses ensure the appropriateness of
the use at a particular location within a given zoning district.
5.5.2 Applicability
Only those uses that are enumerated as conditional uses in a zoning district, as set forth
in the Use Matrix, Table 3-2, shall be authorized by the Director.
5.5.3 Approval Procedure
5.5.3.1 No conditional use permit shall be authorized, developed, or otherwise
carried out until the applicant has secured approval of the conditional use and approval
of a final site plan by the Planning Commission or Director, as applicable.
5.5.3.2 A proceeding for approval of a conditional use shall be initiated by filing
an application with the Department. A pre-application meeting with the Department prior
to filing is required.

North Augusta Development Code 5-22
5.5.3.3 Major Site Plans 
5.5.3.3.1 Major Site Plan applications shall be filed concurrently with conditional
use permit applications. The conditional use application information shall be provided to
the Planning Commission during its review of the major site plan.
5.5.3.3.2 The Planning Commission shall conduct a quasi-judicial hearing in
accordance with the requirements of §5.1.4.5 and shall approve the request, approve
the request with conditions, or deny the request.
5.5.3.3.3 The Planning Commission may place conditions on the use as part of the
approval to assure that adequate mitigation measures are associated with the use. The
conditions shall become a part of the conditional use permit approval and shall be
included in the final site plan approval.
5.5.3.4 Minor Site Plans 
5.5.3.4.1 Minor site plan applications shall be filed concurrently with conditional use
permit applications. The information shall be reviewed concurrently with the review of the
minor site plan.
5.5.3.4.2 The Director shall conduct a quasi-judicial administrative hearing and
shall deny the request, approve the request, or approve the request with conditions.
5.5.3.4.3 The Director may place conditions on the use as part of the approval to
assure that adequate mitigation measures are associated with the use. The conditions
shall become a part of the conditional use permit approval and shall be included in the
final site plan approval.
5.5.3.4.4 An applicant may appeal a denial of a conditional use permit or any
condition applied to the use by the Director to the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission shall conduct a quasi-judicial hearing in accordance with the requirements
of §5.1.4.5 prior to making a decision on a conditional use appeal.
5.5.3.5 An application for a conditional use permit that has been denied may be
resubmitted only if there has been a substantial change in circumstances, as determined
by the Director, or if substantial revisions have been made to the application for
development approval. A determination by the Director may be appealed to the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
5.5.4 Approval Criteria
The following conditions, restrictions, and limitations shall apply to any conditional use
and may be specified in detail as conditions of an approval.
5.5.4.1 The use or development is located, designed, and proposed to be
operated so as to maintain or promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;
5.5.4.2 The use or development complies with all required regulations and
standards of this Chapter, including all applicable provisions of Article 3, Zoning Districts,
and with all other applicable regulations;

North Augusta Development Code 5-23
5.5.4.3 The use or development is located, designed, and proposed to be
operated so as to maintain the value of contiguous property, or that the use or
development is a public necessity; and
5.5.4.4 The use or development conforms with the provisions and policies of the
Comprehensive Plan.
5.5.4.5 Conditions that may be specified as a requirement for a conditional use
permit include:
a. Relationship of allowable uses.
b. Protective screening and/or buffering of property perimeter.

residential zoning districts.
k. Signage.
l. Performance standards relative to: air pollution, noise, glare and heat, vibration,
noxious odors, toxic and liquid wastes, fire and explosion, radioactivity and
electromagnetic radiation.
m. Building design.
5.5.5 Scope of Approval
5.5.5.1 The approval of a conditional use permit shall authorize the applicant to
apply for final site plan approval pursuant to §5.6. All approvals of conditional use
permits require approval of the site plan. Any conditional use permit approval shall not
be in effect unless a required site plan is approved. No building permit may be issued
until the final site plan and conditional use permits are approved. Approval of a
conditional use permit does not authorize any development activity.
5.5.5.2 Minor field alterations or minor revisions to approved conditional uses
may be approved by the Director if the conditional use still meets the intent of the
standards established within the original approval. Minor alteration/revisions shall be
limited to changes that do not increase the intensity, density, or character of the use. If
the Director determines that the change is not minor, the applicant shall apply for a
revised conditional use permit. The applicant may appeal the decision of the Director to
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
5.5.5.3 Violations of any of the conditions applied to a conditional use permit shall
be treated in the manner as set forth in §§5.1.6 and 5.11.
5.5.6 Recordation

North Augusta Development Code 5-35
recommended waivers, conditions of approval or modifications to the major subdivision
application as submitted, if any, with reasons therefore.
5.8.3.4.6 A majority vote is required for the Planning Commission to approve,
approve with conditions, if applicable, or deny a major subdivision application. The
decision of the Planning Commission provides the final approval of the application.
5.8.3.5 Scope of Major Subdivision Approval  Preliminary approval of a major
subdivision development application shall confer upon the applicant the following rights:
a. The approval of the major subdivision application constitutes approval of the
subdivision or land development as to its character, intensity of development,
general layout, and the approximate dimensions of streets, lots, and other planned
features. Such approval binds the developer to the general scheme of the
subdivision or land development and permits the developer to proceed with the
installation of site improvements, subject to obtaining other necessary permits.
b. The approval of the major subdivision application does not constitute approval of a
final subdivision plat, and accordingly, does not authorize the sale of lots or the
occupancy or use of a parcel of land.
c. The applicant may request final approval for the whole, or a section, or sections of
the major subdivision application upon completion of the subdivision and approval of
the development by the city and state agencies with jurisdiction.
d. A major subdivision application, a site specific development plan for the purposes of
this section, approval or conditional approval shall expire two (2) years from said
approval unless a grading permit has been issued and construction has commenced.
The applicant may apply for and the Planning Commission may grant extensions on
such preliminary approval for additional periods up to one (1) year each but not to
exceed five (5) extensions. If an amendment to this Chapter is adopted by the City
Council subsequent to the major subdivision development approval that would
preclude the initial approval, a request for an extension may not be granted. (Rev.
12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18) (Rev. 8-16-10; Ord. 2010-12)
5.8.4 Final Subdivision Plat
5.8.4.1 Initiation  The applicant shall submit a final subdivision plat application
and the information for approval to the Department.
5.8.4.2 Completeness Review  Within ten (10) working days after receipt of the
application, the Department shall determine whether the application for a final plat is
complete. If the final plat application is determined to be incomplete, the Director shall
return to it to the applicant with a statement of the reasons why the proposed subdivision
application is incomplete or otherwise does not conform to the provisions of this Chapter.
The Directors statement will provide the information necessary for the applicant to
revise and resubmit the application.
5.8.4.3 Compliance Review and Decision  Upon a determination of
completeness of a final subdivision plat application, the Director will initiate the review of
the application for compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. The Director and City
Engineer shall approve or deny the application within thirty (30) days after submission of
a complete application, or within such further time as may be consented to by the
applicant. Failure of the Director and City Engineer to act within the period prescribed
shall constitute final subdivision plat approval. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)

major subdivision application approval and all required conditions, the Director and
City Engineer shall approve the application; or
b. If the final subdivision plat application is complete, but does not conform to the
provisions of this Chapter, the major subdivision application approval and all required
conditions, the Director and City Engineer shall deny the final plat and return it to the
applicant for revision and resubmission. If the applicant disagrees with the decision
of the Director or City Engineer, the applicant may appeal the application to the
Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may approve the appealed
application, may approve the appealed application with specific conditions, or may
deny the application. If the application is denied, the Planning Commission shall
state its reasons in the record. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
5.8.4.3.2 A final subdivision plat will not be approved for recording or a site
development plan, if applicable, approved for a certificate of occupancy until the

pursuant to §§5.8.5 and 5.8.6.
5.8.4.5 Scope of Approval  (Rev. 2-21-11; Ord. 2011-02)
a. The final approval of the site development plan or subdivision plat shall not
automatically constitute or effect an acceptance by the City of North Augusta of the
dedication of any street, utility easement or other public ground shown upon the final
plat or final site plan. Public acceptance of the lands must be by action of the City
Council customary to these transactions.
b. The developer shall submit a deed of dedication for all land including roads, parks,
open space and land reserved for public utility purposes, easements, and public
improvement and utility infrastructure to the Department for consideration by the City
Council to accept with the application for a final plat. In addition to the deed of
dedication the developer shall submit a warranty deed of dedication conveying
ownership of the infrastructure system to the city, an owner's affidavit to certify the

(Rev. 2-21-11; Ord. 2011-02)
5.8.5.3 The maintenance guarantee shall be released upon expiration unless the
City Engineer determines that there is work to be corrected prior to that time.
5.8.5.4 The City Engineer shall have full and absolute discretion and authority in
determining as to whether or not a failure has occurred in regard to infrastructure.
5.8.5.5 In the event that the City Engineer, in his sole discretion, determines that
a failure has occurred, he shall provide written notice of such failure to the developer
with a request for the immediate correction of the failure. In the event the developer fails
to make such repairs as necessary within sixty (60) days of such written notice or within
ten (10) days in the event of such notice being received during the last sixty (60) days

5.8.6.3 When the improvements have been completed and approved for
conformity with the provisions of this Chapter by the City Engineer, the guarantee shall
be released and returned.

Commission determines that the proposed waiver does not conflict with the goals and
policies of the Comprehensive Plan or the purposes underlying the standard; and
5.9.1.2 The applicant demonstrates, through documentation and/or studies,
based on generally accepted engineering principles, that adherence to the standard
provided by this Chapter would pose a threat to health and safety or would undermine a
policy set forth in the Comprehensive Plan or the purposes underlying the standard; and
5.9.1.3 The applicant consents to an alternative standard, and the Planning
Commission finds that such standard is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, will
protect the public health, safety and general welfare, and is consistent with the purposes
underlying the standard; and

5.11.1 Violations
Violations of the provisions of this Chapter or failure to comply with any of its
requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with grants of variance or special exceptions, or failure to comply with a compliance
directive issued by the Director, the City Engineer or any other authorized representative
of the City shall constitute a misdemeanor. Each day the violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense.
5.11.2 Penalties
Any person found to be in violation of the provisions of this Chapter or who fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall be punishable as provided in Section 1-8 of the
North Augusta Municipal Code of Ordinances. Each day in violation of the provisions of
this Chapter shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. The penalties shall be in
addition to any remedial activity needed to safeguard the public, the environment or the
City infrastructure.
5.11.3 Enforcement (Adopt. 12-1-14; Ord. 2014-16)
a. Any violation of a provision of this Chapter or violation of or deviation from an
approved application for development approval, site development permit, grading
permit or building permit, or site development undertaken in such a manner as to
adversely affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing or working in the
neighborhood or development site so as to be materially detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood will result in the
issuance of a stop work order by the City. The stop work order will be in the form of
a written notice and will provide for the suspension of the applicable development
permit(s).
b. All development activity covered by the approved application for development
approval, site development permit, grading permit or building permit will cease until
the permittee under the approved application for development approval has received
authorization to resume development activity from the City. Prior to consideration of
an authorization to resume development activity, the permittee shall prepare a
Correction, Compliance and Mitigation Plan to correct identified deviations from the
approved development plan, bring any violations into compliance, and mitigate any
damages created by the deviation or violations. Necessary mitigation proposed by
the plan shall be designed to restore damaged areas, incomplete or unsafe
construction or inadequate development installations to an acceptable condition. In
the case of damage to the natural environment, including riparian buffers, designated
natural open space, natural terrain or City owned property, the restoration shall be to
a condition similar to what existed prior to the damage as determined by the City.
ARTICLE 5  APPROVAL PROCEDURES
North Augusta Development Code 5-42
c. The Citys authorization to resume development will be based on the Correction,
Compliance and Mitigation Plan, the approval by any and all state or federal
agencies with jurisdiction, and an agreement by the permittee to implement the plan.
The Correction, Compliance and Mitigation Plan shall be implemented prior to the
continuation of any other development activity. The Correction, Compliance and
Mitigation Plan may provide for concurrent mitigation and continued development
activity if the City determines that the continued development activity does not
conflict with required mitigation or restoration work.
d. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy a violation.

7.1 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS
7.1.1 Purpose
North Augusta has a rich architectural tradition which has contributed significantly to the
citys image, economic growth and quality of life. The purpose of these regulations is to
ARTICLE 7  BUILDING DESIGN
North Augusta Development Code 7-2
provide specific criteria so that new buildings blend into the historic architectural
framework of the city. These criteria are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation,
or variety, but rather to assist in focusing design principles, which can result in creative
solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within the city, preserve
taxable values, and promote the public health, safety and general welfare.
7.1.2 Findings
These standards:
a. Supplement the zoning regulations applied to multifamily and commercial buildings
with additional standards and procedures which will promote a satisfactory living
environment for residents of multifamily homes and which will permit a mix of
building types within the city;
b. Ensure that there is a visual connection between the living area of the residential
structure or commercial use and the street;
c. Enhance public safety by allowing people to survey their neighborhood from inside
their residences, places of work or shopping areas;
d. Provide a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing large expanses of
blank facades along streets and permit greater diversity in the types of multifamily
housing development.

requirements of Article 5, Approval Procedures.
ARTICLE 8  ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES
North Augusta Development Code 8-4
8.3.4 Determination
8.3.4.1 Adequacy Report
The Director shall prepare a staff report evaluating the availability and adequacy of
public facilities at the adopted LOS. If the Director determines that public facilities are not
available and adequate at the adopted LOS, or will not be available concurrent with the
completion of the development project, the application shall be denied.
8.3.4.2 Determination and Approval
8.3.4.2.1 For those applications that may be approved administratively, a
determination by the Director that public facilities are available and adequate at the
adopted LOS or will be available concurrent with the completion of the development
project will authorize the approval of the application for the purposes of this Article.
8.3.4.2.2 For those applications that require Planning Commission review and
approval the Director shall prepare a staff report along with a recommendation to the
Planning Commission.
8.3.4.2.3 The Director or the Planning Commission, as applicable, shall determine:
a. That the application may be approved because public facilities and services are
adequate and available at the adopted LOS or will be concurrent with the completion
of the development project;
b. That the application shall be denied because public facilities and services are not
available at the adopted LOS or the demand for services generated by the
development project would result in the adopted level of service being exceeded; or
c. That the application shall be approved subject to the deferral of development until all
public facilities are available and adequate if public facilities in the Impact Area are
not adequate to meet the adopted LOS for the entire proposed development,
consistent with the requirements of Table 8-1, Adopted LOS Standards.
8.3.4.3 Advancement of Capacity
In order to avoid undue hardship, the applicant may propose to construct or to secure
funding for the public facilities necessary to provide capacity to accommodate the
proposed development at the adopted LOS and at the time that the impact of the

development (including the approval of subdivision and site development plans and
issuance of building permits) consistent with the requirements of §8.3.6.
8.3.4.4 Rezoning
The determination of adequacy for a rezoning application will not be the sole
determinant in a decision to approve or deny the rezoning application. A proposed
rezoning which could result in a range of potential impacts shall be reviewed as if the
greatest increase in impact would result. The review of adequacy of public facilities for
the application for a rezoning shall compare the capacity of public facilities to the
maximum projected demand which may result from the proposed rezoning based upon
the potential density and intensity of development in the affected area pursuant to the
rezoning.
ARTICLE 8  ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES
North Augusta Development Code 8-5
8.3.5 Effect of Determination of Adequacy of Public Facilities
8.3.5.1 A determination of adequacy of public facilities for a development
proposal shall be deemed to conclude that:
a. Public facilities are adequate and available at the time of issuance of the
determination or will be concurrent with the completion of the development project as
a result of the completion of construction of planned capital improvement projects;
and
b. Public facilities will be considered to be available at all subsequent stages of the
development approval process up to the date of expiration of the final subdivision
plat. This section shall not apply to any rezoning unless it is subject to a development
agreement, in which case the public facilities will be considered to be available for
the duration of said development agreement, or as otherwise provided therein.
8.3.5.2 A determination as set forth in §8.3.5.1, above, is valid until the earlier of:
a. The expiration of the development permit; or
b. If no expiration period is provided for in the development permit, the determination
expires unless construction commences within two (2) years after approval of the
application. For a preliminary plat, the determination expires unless construction
commences on at least one (1) lot within two (2) years after approval of the
preliminary plat.
8.3.6 Advancement of Capacity
8.3.6.1 No advancement of capacity (§8.3.4.3) for public facilities needed to
avoid deterioration in the adopted LOS shall be accepted unless:
a. The proposed public facility is a planned capital improvement; or
b. Appropriate conditions are included to ensure that the applicant will obtain any
necessary approvals for construction of the public facilities from any agency with
jurisdiction thereof prior to or concurrent with the issuance of a final subdivision plat
or other subsequent development permit, or a building permit.
8.3.6.2 The commitment to construct public facilities prior to the issuance of a
building permit pursuant to §8.3.6.1.b., above, shall be included as a condition of the
determination and shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
a. For planned capital improvements, either a finding that the planned capital
improvement is included within the capital improvements program or a resolution by
the City Council to add the improvement to the CIP;
b. An estimate of the total financial resources needed to construct the proposed public
facilities or expansion thereof, and a description of the incremental cost associated
therewith;
c. A schedule for commencement and completion of construction of the planned capital
improvement with specific target dates for multi-phase or large-scale capital
improvement projects;
d. A statement that the planned capital improvement is consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan;
e. A statement that the planned capital improvement is consistent with any ordinances
and policies of the city relating to the construction and design of the public facility;

ARTICLE 8  ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES
North Augusta Development Code 8-6
f. At the option of the City Council in each case and only if the planned capital
improvement proffered by the applicant will provide capacity exceeding the demand
generated by the proposed development, reimbursement may be offered to the
applicant for the pro rata cost of the excess capacity.
8.3.6.3 The construction or funding of only a portion of a public facility needed to
meet the adopted LOS shall be approved by the Planning Commission only where:
a. The public facility will be able to provide the capacity needed to meet the adopted
LOS, and will be fully useable and operational, due to the characteristics of the
facility; or
b. The construction or funding of the balance of the public facility which is needed to
meet the adopted LOS will be accomplished from other sources.
8.4 METHODOLOGY AND CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING
AVAILABILITY AND ADEQUACY OF PUBLIC FACILITIES
8.4.1 Generally
No determination as to compliance with this Article shall be determined by the Director
or recommended by the Director and determined by the Planning Commission unless
public facilities within the impact areas set forth in Column C of Table 8-1, Adopted LOS
standards are:
a. Adequate, as measured by the adopted LOS, as set forth in §8.4.2 and Column B of
Table 8-1; and
b. Available, as set forth in §8.4.3 and Column E of Table 8-1.
8.4.2 Level of Service (LOS) Standards
Compliance with LOS standards shall be measured for each public facility set forth in
Column A of Table 8-1, Adopted LOS Standards, in accordance with the corresponding
standards set forth in Column C of Table 8-1. The LOS for each application for
development approval shall be measured within the Impact Area set forth in Column D of
Table 8-1, for each corresponding facility in Column A. Column E of Table 8-1 indicates
whether planned capacity may be included in determining whether the improvements are
available. Rules for interpretation of Table 8-1 are set forth in §§8.7 through 8.13, and
Appendix A, Definitions.
8.4.3 Adequacy of Public Facilities
Public facilities are adequate if they have available capacity to accommodate the
demand generated by the proposed development, or will have available capacity
concurrent with the implementation of the development in accordance with the following
calculation methodology, unless otherwise indicated herein:
8.4.3.1 Calculate total capacity by adding together the total capacity of public
facilities including planned capital projects consistent with §8.4.2 herein.
8.4.3.2 Calculate available capacity by subtracting from the total capacity the
sum of:
a. The demand for each public facility created by existing development;
b. The demand for each public facility created by the anticipated completion of
committed development; and
ARTICLE 8  ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES
North Augusta Development Code 8-7
c. The demand for each public facility created by the anticipated completion of the
proposed development under consideration for determination.
8.5 PUBLIC FACILITIES AFFECTING AREAS OUTSIDE OF
INCORPORATED AREA OF THE CITY
8.5.1 Applicability
The availability and adequacy of public facilities shall be determined only with respect to
public facilities located within the incorporated areas of the city. If part of the applicable
impact area lies within the citys planning area as defined in the Comprehensive Plan
and in unincorporated Aiken or Edgefield County (adjacent county), absent an
intergovernmental agreement with the city, the availability and adequacy shall be
determined only with respect to public facilities located within the citys incorporated
areas.
8.5.2 Intergovernmental Agreement
If the City Council has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with an adjacent
county to evaluate public facilities in such areas, an applicant will be subject to the
evaluation of the LOS standard for the facility as adopted by the adjacent county. Prior
to the determination of adequacy of public facilities, the Director shall require the
adjacent county to certify that issuance of a development approval for the proposed
development will not cause a reduction in the LOS standards for those facilities lying
within the adjacent county.
8.6 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM (CIP)
8.6.1 Purpose
The CIP is the mechanism by which the City of North Augusta provides new public
facilities, and expansion of the capacity of public facilities, which are needed to
accommodate existing and anticipated future population and employment. Through the
CIP, the city intends to use all reasonable means to provide the public facilities and
services needed to accommodate new growth and development, consistent with the
availability of revenue sources, binding contributions for capital improvements provided
by state or federal sources or applicants, and physical, environmental or topographical
constraints on the expansion of the capacity of public facilities.
The purpose of the capital improvement plans contained in or referred to in the
Transportation and Community Facilities elements of the Comprehensive Plan, priority
project lists associated with specific funding sources, and annual capital projects
appropriations is to:
a. Evaluate the need for public facilities that are subject to this Article;
b. Estimate the cost of improvements for which the city has fiscal responsibility;
c. Analyze the fiscal capability of the city to finance and construct improvements;
d. Adopt financial policies to guide the funding of improvements; and
e. Schedule the funding and construction of improvements in a manner necessary to
ensure that capital improvements are provided when required based on needs
identified in the other Comprehensive Plan elements.

It is the intent of this Article that no application shall be denied, nor shall any condition be
attached to an application pursuant to this Article, unless and until a CIP has been
adopted by the City Council as provided herein.
8.6.3 Capital Improvements Data Requirements
The CIP shall be based upon the following data:
a. The public facility needs as identified in the Comprehensive Plan, as amended.
Where the Comprehensive Plan does not identify a need for public facilities within a
given category, public facility needs shall be determined on the basis of project
population and employment growth as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan, as
amended;
b. The geographic service area and location of major system components for each
public facility shall be identified; and
c. Existing revenue sources and funding mechanisms available for capital improvement
financing shall be inventoried for each public facility.
8.6.4 Capital Improvements Analysis Requirements
The CIP shall be based upon the following analyses:
a. Current local practices that guide the timing and location of construction, extension
or increases in capacity of each public facility;
b. The general fiscal implications of the existing deficiencies and future needs for each
type of public facility. This analysis shall be based on the needed improvements, as
identified by applying the LOS within each Impact Area, and shall address the
relative priority of need among facility types;
c. The costs of needed capital improvements for mitigation of existing deficiencies,
replacement and new growth needs;
d. The basis of cost estimates; and
e. An assessment of the city's ability to finance capital improvements based upon
anticipated population and revenues including:
1. Forecasting of revenues and expenditures for five (5) years;
2. Projections of debt service obligations for currently outstanding bond issues;
3. Projection of ad valorem tax base, assessment ratio and ad valorem tax rate;
4. Projections of other tax bases and other revenue sources such as impact and
user fees;
5. Projection of operating cost considerations; and
6. Projection of debt capacity.
8.6.5 Requirements for Capital Improvements Implementation

a. The applicant may propose mitigation measures as described below as an
alternative to deferral of permits or denial of the application. Mitigation measures
may be permitted which would allow the LOS to be achieved by permitting the
transportation network to function more efficiently, or which advance the construction
of necessary transportation facilities so that they are available concurrent with the
impacts of the development. The applicant shall use the following priority system in
analyzing traffic mitigation proposals, with one (1) ranking the highest and eight (8)
ranking the lowest:
1. Improvements in connectivity internal to the site or between sites including crossaccess
improvements and cross-access easements;
2. New road connections to improve connectivity;
3. Access controls;
4. Median islands;
5. Intersection signalization;
6. The addition of turn lanes;
7. Pedestrian and transit infrastructure such as sidewalks and bus stops or
passenger shelters;
8. Pavement widening; and
9. New road construction, either off site or internal to the site that provides
connectivity in the impact area.
b. Roadways and intersections within the TIA that are expected to operate below the
adopted LOS under traffic conditions including projected traffic plus site-generated
traffic must be identified and viable recommendations made for maintaining
conditions at the adopted LOS.
ARTICLE 8  ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES
North Augusta Development Code 8-10
c. Roadways and intersections within the project site and on all roads and streets along
its boundary that operate or are projected to operate below the adopted LOS, without
project related site-generated traffic, need not to be improved to the adopted LOS by
the proposed development. However, such roadways and intersections, under
conditions which include such site generated traffic, must be improved to the
projected LOS that would exist without the site-generated traffic by altering some
combination of on-site traffic demands, off-site traffic demands, on-site traffic
capacities and off-site traffic capacities.
d. LOS notwithstanding, required traffic impact mitigation improvements are not limited
to those that can be implemented within the project site and on all roads and streets
along its boundary.
8.7.3 Implementation
For phased construction projects, implementation of necessary traffic improvements
must be accomplished no later than the completion of the project phase for which the
capacity analysis shows that they are required. Plats and site plans, if applicable, for
project phases subsequent to a phase for which a traffic improvement is required may
be approved only if the traffic improvements are completed or guaranteed.
8.7.4 Traffic Impact Tiers
Traffic impact tiers for the purposes of determining LOS requirements are defined as:
a. Tier 1: All streets and intersections lying within an area circumscribed by the
Savannah River, Jefferson Davis Highway (US 1), Martintown Road (SC130) and
River Bluff Drive/Road.
b. Tier 2: All streets and intersections not located in Tier 1 and lying within an area
circumscribed by the Savannah River, Horse Creek, Belvedere Clearwater Road (SC
126) as extended beyond Edgefield Road (US 25) to Five Notch Road at Pisgah
Road, Five Notch Road and I-20 including Martintown Road, Jefferson Davis
Highway (US 1), Belvedere Clearwater Road (SC 126) and Five Notch Road.
c. Tier 3: All streets and intersections within the comprehensive planning area not
located within Tier 1 or Tier 2.
8.7.4.1 Zoning Map
The boundaries of the traffic impact tiers described herein are shown on the Official
Zoning Map.
8.7.5 Exemptions
The city finds and determines that certain factors, such as interconnected street
systems, mixed uses and the availability of pedestrian facilities, can result in fewer trips
than isolated, low-density subdivisions. Certain development patterns produce fewer
trips and shorter trips than developments subject to conventional zoning or located on
the fringe of the metropolitan area. The city hereby finds that traffic patterns and
infrastructure within its urban core are established, and that there is a strong public
policy to encourage reinvestment in the citys downtown area. Further, the city hereby
finds that there is a strong public policy to encourage infill development and that there is
little opportunity to expand transportation capacity in many infill areas without destroying
the citys historic built environment. Accordingly, the following are exempt from this
section to the extent described herein:
a. Applications for development approval within the limits of the original plan for the city
as depicted on the 1891 Boeckh Plat or the 1912 Summers Plat or both are entirely
exempt.
ARTICLE 8  ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES
North Augusta Development Code 8-11
b. Any application for a TND subdivision or site plan is exempt by fifty percent (50%).
The trip generation calculation may be reduced by fifty percent (50%) for the purpose
of determining LOS requirements and calculating adequate public facilities pursuant
to this Article.

b. Capacity of the Savannah River intake, wellfield or other source of raw water supply;
c. Historical average flow of potable water;
d. Historical peak flow of potable water;
e. Number of hook-ups and the estimated potable water demand per hook-up; and
f. Number of hook-ups for which contractual commitments have been made.
8.10.2 Determination of Adequacy and Availability
A determination of adequacy and availability of water service by the City Engineer must
be submitted indicating that the project is within the city service area and that it has the
capacity to serve the project as proposed. If the ability of the city to serve a proposed
development is contingent upon planned facility expansion, details regarding such
planned improvements shall be submitted.
8.11 SEWER
8.11.1 Applicability
Applications shall be analyzed with respect to the availability of adequate sanitary sewer
capacity which shall be determined pursuant to the following information:
a. System capacity;

ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-2
9.1 PURPOSE STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES
It is the purpose of this Article to protect human life and health, minimize property
damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods,
including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time
of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or
erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of
natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in
the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other
development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, this Article
prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood
waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
The objectives of this Article are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a
stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in
such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home
buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of this Article are
intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities including water and gas
mains, electric lines, telephone lines, sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the
floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain
management objective of this Article is to minimize expenditure of public money for
costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding.
Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural
functions including temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows,
maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for
diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality.
These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever
possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and
water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains,
especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning
processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs.
9.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
9.2.1 Statutory Authorization
SC Code, Title 5, Articles 7, 23, and 25 (Articles 5 and 7) and Title 6, Article 7, and
amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry.
(Note: Definitions of words and terms related to floodplain management and used in this
Article are contained in Appendix A to this Chapter and in Section 59.1, Title 44 of the
Code of Federal Regulations.)
9.2.2 Finding of Fact
The special flood hazard areas of North Augusta are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, creates health and safety hazards, disrupts commerce
and governmental services, creates extraordinary public expenditure requirements for
flood protection and relief, and impairs the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-3
public health, safety and general welfare. Furthermore, flood losses are caused by the
cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities. Flood losses are also caused by occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
9.2.3 Applicability
This Article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of North
Augusta, South Carolina as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) declared to be a part of this Chapter and adopted in §3.2.2.
9.2.4 Development Permit Required
A development permit is required in conformance with this Chapter prior to the
commencement of any development activities on flood hazard land.
9.2.5 Compliance
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable
regulations.
9.2.6 Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this Article all provisions shall be considered as
minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed
neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This Article is not
intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this Article and another conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
9.2.7 Partial Invalidity and Severability
If any part of this Article is declared invalid, the remainder of this Article shall not be
affected and shall remain in force.
9.2.8 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger
floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This Article does not imply that land outside the areas of special
flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This Article shall not create liability on the part of North Augusta or by any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Article
or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

9.3 ADMINISTRATION
9.3.1 Designation of Local Floodplain Administrator
The Superintendent of Building Standards and/or designee is hereby appointed to be the
Local Floodplain Administrator and to administer and implement the provisions of this
Article.
9.3.2 Development Permit and Certification Requirements
Application for a development permit shall be made to the Local Floodplain Administrator
and the Department of Planning and Economic Development on forms furnished by him
or her prior to any development activities. The development permit may include, but not
be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing: the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures; and
the location of fill materials, storage areas, and drainage facilities. Specifically, in
addition to the information required pursuant to Appendix B, Application Documents, and
other provisions of this Chapter, the following information is required:
9.3.2.1 A plot plan that shows the 100-year floodplain contour or a statement that
the entire lot is within the floodplain must be provided by the development permit
applicant when the lot is within or appears to be within the floodplain as mapped by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the floodplain identified pursuant to either
the Duties and Responsibilities of the Local Floodplain Administrator of §9.3.3 or the
Standards for Subdivision Proposals of §9.4.5 and the Standards for Streams without
Established Base Flood Elevations and Floodways of §9.4.3. The plot plan must be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional
engineer and certified by same.
9.3.2.2 The plot plan required by §9.3.2.1 must show the floodway, if any, as
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the floodway identified
pursuant to either the Duties and Responsibilities of the Local Floodplain Administrator
of §9.3.3 or the Standards for Subdivision Proposals of §9.4.5 and the Standards for
Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations and Floodways of §9.4.3.
9.3.2.3 Where base flood elevation data is provided as set forth in §9.2.3 or the
Duties and Responsibilities of the Local Floodplain Administrator of §9.3.3, the
application for a development permit within the flood hazard area shall show:
a. The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor of all new and
substantially improved structures; and
b. If the structure will be floodproofed in accordance with §9.4.2.2, the elevation, in

or the Duties and Responsibilities of the Local Floodplain Administrator of §9.3.3, then
the provisions in the Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations
and Floodways of §9.4.3 must be met.
9.3.2.5 Where any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of
proposed development, the application for a development permit shall include:
a. A description of the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation;
b. An engineering study to demonstrate that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated watercourse is maintained; and
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-5
c. A map showing the location of the proposed watercourse alteration or relocation.
9.3.2.6 When a structure is floodproofed, the applicant shall provide certification
from a registered, professional engineer or architect that the non-residential,
floodproofed structure meets the floodproofing criteria in §§9.4.2.2 and 9.4.6.
9.3.2.7 A lowest floor elevation or floodproofing certification is required after the
lowest floor is completed. As soon as possible after completion of the lowest floor and
before any further vertical construction commences, or floodproofing by whatever
construction means, whichever is applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the Local Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the lowest
floor, or floodproofed elevation, whichever is applicable, as built, in relation to mean sea
level. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. Any work done
prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The Local
Floodplain Administrator shall review the floor elevation survey data submitted.
Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder
immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to
submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to
issue a stop-work order for the project.
9.3.2.8 When a structure is located in Zones V, VE or V1-30, certification shall be
provided by a registered professional engineer or architect, separate from submitted
plans, that new construction or substantial improvement meets the criteria in §9.4.2.9.

highest known historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500 year flood elevation data;
9.4.1.6 Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment,
including ductwork, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located at one
(1) foot or above the base flood elevation so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This requirement
does not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses,
etc., provided that cut off devices and back flow devices are installed to prevent
contamination to the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to
the building;
9.4.1.7 All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
9.4.1.8 New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters;

contained in this Article. This includes post-FIRM development and structures.
9.4.1.12 Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 19, Nonconforming Uses, of the
North Augusta Development Code, nonconforming buildings may not be enlarged,
replaced or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in
conformance with this Article. Provided, however, nothing in this Article shall prevent the
repair, reconstruction or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or
partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below
base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair,
reconstruction or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this Article.
9.4.1.13 Nonconforming uses may not be enlarged, changed to another
nonconforming use, or resumed if abandoned for a continuous period of six (6) months.
9.4.1.14 A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction
outlined in §9.4.2, as well as any applicable requirements of the American with
Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise
waiving these requirements. The cost of improvements required to meet ADA provisions
shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial
improvement.
9.4.2 Specific Standards
In all areas of special flood hazard (Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE) where
base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in §§9.2.3 or 9.3.3.13 or
outlined in §9.3.4, the following provisions are required:
9.4.2.1 Residential Construction  New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the
lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. No
basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall
be provided in accordance with §9.4.2.5.
9.4.2.2 Non-Residential Construction  New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or non-residential structure, including

above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be
used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
flood waters shall be provided in accordance with §9.4.2.5. No basements are permitted.
Structures located in A Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all
areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A
registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this
subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the Local Floodplain
Administrator as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in §9.3.2.6. A
variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance
with the criteria outlined in §9.6.5 of this Article. Agricultural structures not meeting the
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-12
criteria of §9.6.5 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other
applicable provisions of this Article. Structures which are floodproofed are required to
have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The maintenance plan
must be approved by the Local Floodplain Administrator and notification of the annual
exercise shall be provided to same.
9.4.2.3 Manufactured Homes 
a. Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a
manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision,
in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home
has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is
elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation and must be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
b. Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision that is not subject to the provisions
of §9.4.2.3.a, must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is
elevated to no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, and must be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse
and lateral movement.
c. Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement in accordance with §40-29-
10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended.
Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the
chassis thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be
supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent
strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height,
an engineering certification is required.
d. An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new,
substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or
subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and
approved by the Local Floodplain Administrator and the Department of Public Safety
Emergency Preparedness Coordinator.
9.4.2.4 Recreational Vehicles  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use
if it is on wheels or a jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. Recreational
vehicles placed on sites shall either be located in a flood hazard zone site for fewer than
one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or be fully licensed and ready for highway
use, or meet the development permit and certification requirements of §9.3.3 and
manufactured home standards of §§9.4.2.3 and 9.4.2.5.
9.4.2.5 Elevated Buildings  New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are
usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or limited storage in an area
other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to preclude
finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-13
a. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional
engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the following minimum criteria:
1. Provide a minimum of two (2) openings on different walls having a total net area
of not less than one (1) square inch for every one (1) square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding. If there are multiple enclosed areas, each area must
have openings in its exterior walls;
2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the higher
of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening;
3. Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can
be counted towards the required net open area;
4. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or
devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions;
and,
5. Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the
enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building
on at least one (1) side of the building.
b. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system
where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are
excessive (greater than five (5) feet per second), foundation systems other than solid
foundation walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows
are minimized.
c. For enclosures below the lowest floor, access to the enclosed area shall be the
minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior
door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
d. The interior portion of enclosures below the lowest floor shall not be finished or
partitioned into separate rooms except to enclose a single storage area, must be
void of utilities except for essential lighting as required for safety, and cannot be
temperature controlled. One (1) wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a
ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor
elevation specified in §§9.4.2.1, 9.4.2.2 and 9.4.2.3.
e. All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in
§§9.4.2.1, 9.4.2.2 and 9.4.2.3 shall be of flood resistant materials.
9.4.2.6 Accessory Structures  A detached accessory structure or garage, the
cost of which is greater than $3,000, must comply with the requirements as outlined in
FEMAs Technical Bulletin 7-93 Wet Floodproofing Requirements or be elevated in
accordance with §§9.4.2.1 and 9.4.2.5 or dryproofed in accordance with §9.4.2.2. If
accessory structures of $3,000 or less are to be placed in the floodplain, the following
criteria shall be met:
a. Accessory structures shall not be used for any uses other than the parking of
vehicles and storage;
b. Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
c. Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to
offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
d. Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and
lateral movement of the structure;
e. Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be installed in
accordance with §9.4.1.5; and
f. Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be provided below base
flood elevation in conformance with §9.4.2.5.

North Augusta Development Code 9-14
g. Accessory structures shall be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with
Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08
and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Class 4 and 5
materials referenced therein are acceptable flood resistant materials.
9.4.2.7 Swimming Pool Utility Equipment Rooms  If the building cannot be
built at or above the BFE because of functionality of the equipment, then a structure to
house the utilities for a swimming pool may be built below the BFE with the following
provisions:
a. The building must meet the requirements for accessory structures in §9.4.2.6; and
b. The utilities must be anchored to prevent flotation and shall be designed to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the
base flood.
9.4.2.8 Elevators  The following requirements are applicable to the construction
of elevators subject to this Article:
a. A float switch system or another system that provides the same level of safety is
required when there is a potential for the elevator cab to descend below the BFE
during a flood per FEMAs Technical Bulletin 4-93: Elevator Installation for Buildings
Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
b. All equipment that may have to be installed below the BFE such as counter weight
roller guides, compensation cable and pulleys, oil buffers for traction elevators and
the jack assembly for a hydraulic elevator must be constructed using flood-resistant
materials where possible per FEMAs Technical Bulletin 4-93: Elevator Installation
for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
9.4.2.9 Floodways  Areas designated as floodways are located within areas of
special flood hazard established in §9.2.3. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and potential projectiles and erosion
potential.
The following provisions shall apply within floodways:
a. No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,
additions and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result
in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such
certification and technical data shall be presented to the Local Floodplain
Administrator.
b. A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must be obtained upon completion of the proposed
development.
c. If the above are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §9.4.
d. No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and
the elevation standards of §9.4.2.3 and the encroachment standards of 9.4.2.9.a are
met.
e. Permissible uses within floodways may include general farming, pasture, outdoor
plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm and other similar
agricultural, wildlife and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-15
grounds, hiking and horseback riding trails and Greeneways are acceptable uses,
provided that they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a
permissible use may require a no-impact certification. The uses listed in this section
are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base
flood elevations or changes to the floodway configuration.
9.4.2.10 Fill  Fill is discouraged because storage capacity is removed from
floodplains. Elevating buildings by other methods must be considered. An applicant shall
demonstrate that fill is the only alternative to raising the building to at least one (1) foot
above the base flood elevation, and that the amount of fill used will not affect the flood
storage capacity or adversely affect adjacent properties. The following provisions shall
apply to all fill placed in the special flood hazard area:
a. Fill may not be placed in the floodway unless it is in accordance with §9.4.2.9.a;
b. Fill may not be placed in wetlands without the required state and federal permits;
c. Fill must consist of soil and rock materials only. Dredged material may be used as fill
only upon certification of suitability by a registered professional geotechnical
engineer. Landfills, rubble fills, dumps and sanitary fills are not permitted in the
floodplain;
d. Fill used to support structures must comply with ASTM Standard D-698, and its
suitability to support structures certified by a registered, professional engineer;
e. Fill slopes shall be no greater or steeper than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical.
Flatter slopes may be required where velocities may result in erosion; and
f. The use of fill shall not increase flooding or cause drainage problems on neighboring
properties.
g. Fill may not be used for structural support in the coastal high hazard areas.
h. Fill shall meet the requirements of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, Ensuring That
Structures Built on Fill in or Near Special Flood Hazard Areas Are Reasonably Safe
from Flooding.
9.4.3 Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations
and Floodways
Located within the areas of special flood hazard (Zones A and V) established in §9.2.3
are small streams where no base flood data has been provided and where no floodways
have been identified. The following provisions apply within such areas:
9.4.3.1 In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data are
not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
that generates base flood elevations for all subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments greater than two (2) lots or one (1) acre, whichever is less.
9.4.3.2 No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within one hundred (100) feet of
the stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
9.4.3.3 If §9.4.3.1 is satisfied and base flood elevation data is available from
other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions of §9.4 and shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established in accordance with
§9.3.4.10. Data from preliminary, draft and final Flood Insurance Studies constitutes best
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-16
available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical Bulletin 1-98 Use of
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Data as Available Data. If an appeal is pending on a study
in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be
used.
9.4.3.4 When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal,
state or other source, one of the following methods may be used to determine a BFE.
For further information regarding the BFE determination, refer to FEMAs manual
Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas:
a. Contour Interpolation
1) Superimpose approximate Zone A boundaries onto a topographic map and
estimate a BFE;
2) Add one-half of the contour interval of the topographic map that is used to the
BFE.
b. Data Extrapolation  A BFE can be determined if a site within five hundred (500) feet
upstream of a stream reach for which a 100-year profile has been computed by
detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope characteristics are
relatively similar to the downstream reaches. No hydraulic structures shall be
present.
c. Hydrologic and Hydraulic Calculations  Perform hydrologic and hydraulic
calculations to determine BFEs using FEMA approved methods and software.
9.4.4 Standards for Streams With Established Base Flood Elevations But
Without Floodways
Along rivers and streams where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data are provided but no
floodway is identified for a Special Flood Hazard Area on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) or in the FIS, the following provision shall apply:
9.4.4.1 No encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other developments shall be permitted unless certification with
supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City.
9.4.5 Standards for Subdivision Proposals and Other Proposed
Development
9.4.5.1 All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and are subject to all applicable
standards in these regulations;
9.4.5.2 All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall
have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
9.4.5.3 Where possible, provision shall be made for alternative vehicular access
and escape routes in the event that normal routes are blocked or destroyed by flooding;
9.4.5.4 All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and,
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-17
9.4.5.5 The applicant shall meet the requirement to submit technical data to
FEMA in §9.5 when a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis is completed that generates
base flood elevations.
9.4.6 Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §9.2.3, are areas
designated as shallow flooding. The following provisions shall apply within such areas:
9.4.6.1 All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to at least as high as the depth number
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If
no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three (3) feet
above the highest adjacent grade.
9.4.6.2 All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
a. Have the lowest floor elevated to at least as high as the depth number specified on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth
number is specified, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above
the highest adjacent grade; or,
b. Be completely floodproofed together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities to or
above that level, so that any space below that level is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in §9.3.4.
c. All structures on slopes must have drainage paths around them to guide water away
from the structures.
9.5 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES
9.5.1 Purpose
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires flood data to be reviewed and
approved by FEMA. This ensures that flood maps, studies and other data identified in
§9.2.3 accurately represent flooding conditions so that appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data.
9.5.2 Requirement to Submit New Technical Data
For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood
elevations, the Local Floodplain Administrator shall ensure that technical data reflecting
such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such information
becomes available. These development proposals include:
a. Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood elevations or alter
floodway boundaries;
b. Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where the applicant
desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area;
c. Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special flood
hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and
d. Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of
base flood elevations in accordance with §9.4.3.1.
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-18
9.5.2.1 It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data, required in
accordance with §9.5, prepared in a format for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision
(CLOMR) or Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall also be the responsibility of the applicant.
9.5.2.2 The Local Floodplain Administrator shall require a CLOMR prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
a. Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation; and
b. Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by more than one
(1) foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway.
9.5.2.3 Floodplain development permits issued by the Local Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a LOMR from FEMA for
any development proposal subject to §9.5.
9.5.3 Right to Submit New Technical Data
The Local Floodplain Administrator may request changes to any of the information
shown on an effective map that does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall
include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the local jurisdiction
and may be submitted at any time.
9.6 VARIANCE PROVISIONS
9.6.1 Establishment of Appeal Board
The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the City of North Augusta in Article 18,
Administration, of the North Augusta Development Code, shall hear and decide requests
for variances from the requirements of this Article.
9.6.2 Right to Appeal
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals or any taxpayer
may appeal such decision as provided in Article 18, Administration of the North Augusta
Development Code and pursuant to S.C. Code §6-29-820 to the circuit court in and for
the counties of Aiken and Edgefield as applicable.
9.6.3 Historic Structures
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
9.6.4 Functionally Dependent Uses
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use, provided the criteria of §9.6 are met, no reasonable alternatives exist,
and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage and create no
additional threat to public safety.
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-19
9.6.5 Agricultural Structures
Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure provided it is used
solely for agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages during the base
flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure must meet all of the
conditions and considerations of §9.6.8, this section, and the following standards:
9.6.5.1 Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed
below:
a. Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for the storage of
farm machinery and equipment;
b. Steel grain bins and steel frame corn cribs;
c. General purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock which are open on at
least one (1) side;
d. For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy operations and similar
livestock operations, variances may not be issued for structures which were
substantially damaged. New construction or substantial improvement of such
structures must meet the elevation requirements of §9.4.2.2 of this Article;
9.6.5.2 The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an
existing building which is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials for the
exterior and interior building components and elements below the base flood elevation;
9.6.5.3 The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components must be
capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy,
hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. Where flood velocities exceed five (5) feet per
second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable pressure on the building's
enclosure walls or foundation walls;
9.6.5.4 The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of §9.4.2.5.
9.6.5.5 Any mechanical, electrical or other utility equipment must be located
above the base flood elevation so that it is contained within a watertight, floodproofed
enclosure which is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions. The structure
must comply with §9.4.1.5;
9.6.5.6 The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment
provisions of §9.4.2.9; and,
9.6.5.7 Major equipment, machinery or other contents must be protected. Such
protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the
use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents
on pedestals or shelves above the base flood elevation, or determining that property
owners can safely remove contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be
located to a specified site out of the floodplain.
9.6.6 Considerations
In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this
Article, and:
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-20
9.6.6.1 The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
9.6.6.2 The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and
the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
9.6.6.3 The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage
and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
9.6.6.4 The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
9.6.6.5 The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
9.6.6.6 The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion
damage, for the proposed use;
9.6.6.7 The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
9.6.6.8 The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the
site; and
9.6.6.9 The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
9.6.6.10 Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain
areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The
applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous
parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the Special Flood
Hazard Area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available.
9.6.7 Findings
Findings listed above shall be submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals, in writing, and
included in the application for a variance. Additionally, comments from the SC
Department of Natural Resources Land, Water and Conservation Division, State
Coordinator's Office, must be taken into account and included in the permit file.
9.6.8 Floodways
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increases in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to
the issuance of the variance. In order to insure the project is built in compliance with the
CLOMR for which a variance is granted, the applicant must provide a performance
guarantee and letter of credit for one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the cost to
perform the development. The performance guarantee and letter of credit shall be valid
for a period equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the estimated time
required to complete construction of the development.
ARTICLE 9  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
North Augusta Development Code 9-21
9.6.9 Conditions
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this Article, the Board
of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this Article. The following conditions shall apply to
all variances:
9.6.9.1 Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in
violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations or ordinances.
9.6.9.2 Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
9.6.9.3 Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient
cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
9.6.9.4 Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the
structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
9.6.9.5 The Local Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request.
9.6.9.6 Variances shall not be issued for development initiated without a permit or
other development that is not in compliance with this Article. Violations must be
corrected in accordance with §9.3.5.5 of this Article.

10.1 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS
The purpose of the landscaping, screening and buffer requirements provided in this
Article is to provide standards that will protect the health, safety and general welfare of
the public, enhance property values, improve the appearance of the community and
preserve natural resources, trees and native plants. Planting yard regulations are
established herein to minimize potential conflicts between abutting developments,
enhance the appearance of buildings and parking lots and create a unified and attractive
streetscape. These requirements will be applied to all new development, redevelopment
or building expansion projects including streetscaping of rights of ways.
These minimum requirements will:
a. Reduce soil erosion and increase infiltration in permeable land areas essential to
stormwater management and aquifer recharge;
b. Mitigate air, dust, noise, heat and chemical pollution;
c. Reduce the heat island effect of impervious surfaces, such as parking lots, by
cooling and shading the surface area and breaking up large expanses of pavement;
d. Establish a landscape theme including street trees and streetscape designs to be
used throughout the City of North Augusta to promote the overall character and
identity of the community;
e. Address the design of entryways into North Augusta to express the communitys
values;
f. Provide for the appropriate improvement and maintenance of streetscapes;
g. Preserve existing native vegetation as an integral part of the wildlife habitats, and
incorporate native plants and ecosystems into landscape design;
ARTICLE 10  LANDSCAPING
North Augusta Development Code 10-3
h. Promote innovative and cost-conscious approaches to the design, installation and
maintenance of landscaping while encouraging water and energy conservation;
i. Promote planting techniques that ensure long term health of plant materials;
j. Screen unsightly equipment or materials from the view of persons on public streets
or adjoining properties and buffering from incompatible land uses;
k. Maintain and increase property values by requiring site appropriate landscaping to
be incorporated into development that is designed and installed by a qualified
landscape professional;
l. Promote walkable pedestrian-scale streetscapes, traditional neighborhoods and
compact centers by exempting uses which relate to each other functionally and
visually from certain requirements of this Article;
m. Provide reasonable landscaping at site entrances, in public areas, in parking lots and
adjacent to building which varies in type and amount required by the type of
development;
n. Provide for the regular and consistent irrigation of landscaped areas; and
o. Ensure that the plant or other landscaping material that best serves the intended
function and is appropriate for the local climate, soil conditions and general site
characteristics is selected.

North Augusta Development Code 10-5
10.2.4 Expansion of Uses
The expansion of an existing use, structure or parking lot shall comply with this section
only for the expansion area. Applicants are encouraged, but not required, to landscape
existing areas in conformance with this section.
10.3 GENERALLY
10.3.1 Interpretation of Landscaping Terms
Where necessary to interpret the precise meaning of technical landscaping terms
used in this section, reference shall be made to the following:
a. Appendix A, Definitions; and
b. Where a term is not defined in Appendix A, to the American Nursery and Landscape
Association (ANLA), formerly the American Association of Nurserymen, American
Standard for Nursery Stock, 1996, which document is hereby incorporated by
reference.
10.3.2 Computation of Total Required Landscaping
Minimum dimensions shall apply, and be measured, horizontally. Buffer widths shall be
measured from the respective property line, except where buffers are permitted to
straddle property lines, as set forth in §10.5.4.3. Where buffers turn at property corners,
the length measurements that determine plant quantities do not overlap. Landscaping
plant material that is required within a separate and distinct Landscape Area is counted
for only that Landscape Area, and may not be used in calculating the minimum quantity
for any other planting Landscape Area.
10.3.3 Specifications for Plant Materials and Installation
10.3.3.1 Size Standards  The minimum allowable plant size at the time of
planting is established in Table 10-2. Due to the variation between genus and species,
the caliper or height for newly installed plant materials may vary.

10.3.3.2 Selection of Plant Materials 
a. All plant material, except ground covers, shall be selected from Appendix C,
Approved Plants, except as provided in 10.3.3.2.b.
b. The Director may approve a plant species not listed in Appendix C, Approved Plants,
after consulting with appropriate city staff, landscape architect or landscape
contractor. In approving such species, the Director shall consider the environmental
conditions of the site, including soil, topography, climate, microclimate, pattern of sun
movement, prevailing winds, precipitation and air movement to ensure that plant
materials will be established successfully. In approving such species for Street
Trees, or other locations within utility rights of way, the Director shall consider the
presence or planned addition of overhead utility lines. Such trees shall be small and
medium trees that are pest and disease resistant and slow growing. The Director
may approve the installation of comparable substitution plant materials to satisfy the
requirements of the approved Landscape Plan when the approved plants and
landscape materials are not available at the time that installations are to occur, or
when other unforeseen conditions prevent the use of the exact materials shown on
the approved Landscape Plan. Significant changes that require the replacement and
relocation of more than twenty five percent (25%) of the plant materials shall require
a new Landscape Plan and approval through the plan review process.
10.3.3.3 Mix of Genus and Species Encouraged  Except for Street Trees,
§10.7, a mix of genus and species of trees, shrubs, ground cover, perennials and
annuals is encouraged, but not required, in order to avoid potential loss due to infectious
disease, blight or insect infestation.
10.3.4 Existing Vegetation
Existing healthy vegetation may be counted toward the required landscaping if it is used
as a year-round sight obstruction buffer. The Director may conduct site inspections in
order to determine whether the existing vegetation is useable as a sight obstruction
buffer. In order to do so, the Landscape Plan must indicate the type, number and size of
existing plants that are sufficient to comply with the respective buffer. It is not necessary
to indicate the total inventory of existing plants. Only plants required to meet this Article
must be listed.
ARTICLE 10  LANDSCAPING
North Augusta Development Code 10-7
10.3.5 Automatic Irrigation Required
All buffers and landscape areas required by this Article except residential lot landscaping
as required in §10.9 shall include an automatic irrigation system that will provide
adequate periodic irrigation to maintain the landscape as designed.
10.4 ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
10.4.1 Landscape Plan Required
Landscape Plans shall accompany every application for a minor site plan, major site
plan and major subdivision plan. Such plans shall be sealed by a landscape architect or
certified by a nurseryman, horticulturist or certified landscape contractor. Landscape
Plans shall conform to the requirements of Appendix B, Application Documents. (Rev.
12-1-14; Ord. 2014-16)
10.4.2 Permits Required
No clearing permit shall be issued unless the applicant has taken measures to preserve
trees on the site.
10.4.3 Maintenance Guarantee
10.4.3.1 In order to assure the satisfactory condition and survival of installed
landscape improvements, the applicant, prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy or final subdivision plat approval, shall post a maintenance guarantee. The
maintenance guarantee shall be on forms provided by the Department and shall be
equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the estimated cost of the landscape improvements as
determined by the Director and shall be for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the
date of the approval of the final subdivision plat or certificate of occupancy. The Director
may consult with appropriate city staff, a landscape architect or other landscape
contractor to verify the cost of landscape improvements. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
10.4.3.2 The maintenance guarantee shall be supported by a letter of credit. The
maintenance guarantee and letter of credit shall expire no sooner than twenty-four (24)
months from the approval of the final subdivision plat or certificate of occupancy as
required in §10.4.4.1. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
10.4.3.3 The maintenance guarantee shall be released upon expiration unless the
Director determines that there is work to be corrected prior to that time.
10.4.3.4 If such a determination is made, the Director shall notify the applicant of
the deficiencies, and the applicant shall be given sixty (60) days to complete the work. If
the work is not completed, the proceeds from the letter of credit shall be used by the city
for such work. The maintenance guarantee shall be released when the Director deems
the work satisfactorily completed and the city has been reimbursed for any and all
expenses incurred.
10.4.3.5 The landscape maintenance guarantee for a final subdivision plat may be
combined with and included in the maintenance guarantee required for subdivision
improvements as provided for in §5.8.5.
10.4.3.6 For seasonal uses that are planned or proposed to be closed for any
period in excess of ninety (90) consecutive days, the applicant shall provide a signed
ARTICLE 10  LANDSCAPING
North Augusta Development Code 10-8
contract for landscape maintenance specifying the annual landscape maintenance
program and specifically providing for maintenance during the periods the seasonal use
is not in business or occupied. Additionally, the applicant shall provide a continuing
maintenance guarantee supported by a letter of credit or cash deposit to the City to be
used in the event that the landscape is not adequately maintained. The amount of the
maintenance guarantee and letter of credit or cash deposit will be equal to fifteen
percent (15%) of the cost of the initial landscape installation or the amount of an annual
landscape maintenance contract, whichever is greater. If the use changes and the use
is not closed for any period in excess of ninety (90) consecutive days, the maintenance
guarantee will no longer be required and the letter of credit or cash deposit will be
returned. (Adopt. 3-15-10; Ord. 2010-05)
10.4.3.7 The Director may reduce the amount or waive the requirement for a
landscape maintenance guarantee and associated letter of credit or cash deposit where
he determines that the scope of the landscaping is minimal and the cost of the
guarantee exceeds the benefit or where natural landscaping that does not require
continuing maintenance is installed. The Director may consult with appropriate city staff,
a landscape architect or other landscape professional to determine the appropriateness
and amount of a waiver. (Adopt. 3-15-10; Ord. 2010-05)
10.4.4 Performance Guarantee
10.4.4.1 A certificate of occupancy subject to the completion of landscaping
improvements may be approved by the Director for occupancy of a structure or initiation
of a use prior to the installation or completion of required and approved landscaping
improvements in accordance with this section.
10.4.4.2 An applicant may request a certificate of occupancy subject to the
completion of landscaping improvements under the following conditions:
a. The planting season is not appropriate;
b. Adverse weather conditions;
c. Specified plant material is not immediately available; or
d. Other reasonable factors as determined by the Director.
10.4.4.3 A request for a certificate of occupancy subject to completion of
landscaping improvements shall include the following information:
a. A specific description of the factor(s) hindering completion or installation of the
required improvement(s); and
b. A written estimate from a licensed contractor of the cost of materials and labor for
completing the work.
10.4.4.4 The Director shall determine if a certificate of occupancy subject to
completion of landscaping improvements is appropriate and if the cost to complete
estimate is acceptable. The Director may consult with appropriate city staff, a landscape
architect or other landscape contractor prior to acceptance to verify the estimated
completion cost and may modify the amount of the performance guarantee accordingly.
If the Director determines that a certificate of occupancy may be issued, the applicant
shall submit a performance guarantee on approved forms supported by a certified check,
cashiers check or letter of credit. Such guarantee shall be in an amount equal to one
hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the cost to complete the landscaping installation
for a period not exceeding fourteen (14) months. (Rev. 2-21-11; Ord. 2011-02)
ARTICLE 10  LANDSCAPING
North Augusta Development Code 10-9
10.4.4.5 The performance guarantee shall be released after the landscape
improvements, as guaranteed, have been installed, inspected and determined to be in
full compliance with the approved Landscape Plan.
10.4.4.6 If the required landscape improvements have not been installed after a
period of twelve (12) months, the Director shall notify the applicant of a failure to
complete the landscape improvements. If the required improvements have not been
completed within thirty (30) days of notification, the Director shall utilize the performance
guarantee to implement the required landscape improvements.
10.4.4.7 Violations  Failure to maintain required landscaping subsequent to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy or to adhere to an approved landscaping plan is a
violation of the requirements of this Chapter and subject to any and all remedies.
10.5 LANDSCAPE BUFFERS
10.5.1 Purpose
The purpose of buffers is to provide a transitional area between uses that may differ in
development intensity and density, or to provide a separation between uses of similar
intensity and density. Required landscaped buffers are intended to ensure that a natural
area of appropriate size and density of plantings is installed or preserved between
zoning districts and/or uses. The type of buffer varies based upon the type and
relationship between the adjacent land uses. The width of the buffer and the density of
plantings increases as the difference between adjacent land uses increases.
10.5.2 Applicability
In addition to the exemptions as set forth in §10.2.3, the following uses are exempt from
the buffer requirements as described in this section:
10.5.2.1 Lots or parcels separated by a public right of way equal to or greater than
twenty (20) feet wide;
10.5.2.2 Lots or parcels separated by a railroad right of way, power line easement
or other utility or transportation easement that is equal to or greater than twenty (20) feet
wide except for the width requirements of Type D buffers.
10.5.2.3 Lots or parcels separated by designated and maintained property used
for natural open space, park including the Greeneway, drainage way, stormwater
treatment and detention, or other acceptable undevelopable use with a minimum width
of thirty (30) feet at the narrowest except for the width requirements of Type D buffers
where the minimum width of the open space is less than forty (40) feet. Designated and
maintained shall mean land platted for the specific purpose, owned by the city or other
public agency and restricted to the specific purpose or subject to a recorded
conservation easement.
10.5.3 Buffer Types
10.5.3.1 There are four (4) different classes of land uses that determine the buffer
type. Land use classes are based upon the zoning classification of the parcel, the
proposed use of the development or the existing use of land. The zoning classification
will be used only when the existing land use is vacant and there is no use proposed for
ARTICLE 10  LANDSCAPING
North Augusta Development Code 10-10
the parcel. The classes of land use are shown in Table 10-3. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-
18)

10.5.3.2 Table 10-3 identifies the buffer type required for a proposed development
based on the adjacent land use class. Buffer types are designated by A, B, C or D and
are identified in Table 10-4. If an adjacent parcel is undeveloped, the minimum buffer is
based on the zoning district on the adjacent property.

10.5.3.3 Table 10-6 defines buffer types by the required plantings and dimensions.
The width of the buffer and the density of plantings increases as the difference in the
nature and intensity of development between adjacent land use classes increases.
Each buffer type must provide a minimum density of landscaping as calculated by buffer
points prescribed in Table 10-5. Buffer points are assigned to plantings as follows:

10.5.4 Standards for Buffer Development
10.5.4.1 Prohibited Uses  The construction of any building or the placement of
any mechanical equipment within the buffer is not permitted except for items specified in
§10.5.4.2. Signs may be placed within the buffer consistent with the sign regulations
specified in Article 13, Signs. Active open space, circulation drives other than required
access drives, parking lots and other impervious surfaces are not permitted in the buffer.
10.5.4.2 Permitted Uses  The following uses are permitted in a buffer if none of
the required plant material is eliminated, the intended screening is accomplished, the
total width of the buffer is maintained and all other requirements of §10.5 are met:
a. Passive open space (not active open space);
b. Sculpture, outdoor furniture, picnic areas;
c. Pedestrian, bike or equestrian Greeneways;
d. Golf courses;
e. Storm water retention basins;
f. Equipment necessary to provide utilities; and
g. Fences and walls.
10.5.4.3 Buffer on Property Line  When platting abutting lots, the applicant may
establish a buffer that straddles the property line if the cumulative buffer width is
maintained for both Landscape Areas.
ARTICLE 10  LANDSCAPING
North Augusta Development Code 10-12
10.5.4.4 Visual Separation  Where a section of this Chapter requires complete
visual separation, this may be accomplished through the use of landscaping which
provides year-round opaque screening, earth berms, masonry walls or fences
constructed of pressure-treated wood or other wood resistant to deterioration due to
exposure to weather, moisture and insects or a combination of two or more of these
techniques. Even where complete visual separation is achieved, the landscaping and
buffer requirements still apply.
10.6 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPE AREAS
Parking Lot Landscape Areas aesthetically and visually enhance the appearance of
parking lots. Parking lot landscaping mitigates the heat island effect, stormwater runoff
and negative visual impacts of parking areas. Smaller parking lots are exempt from
these requirements to encourage the dispersal of paved areas and infill development on
smaller lots. In order to mitigate the impact of larger parking areas, Parking Lot
Landscape Areas are based upon the size of the respective parking lot. The size of the
required Parking Lot Landscape Area increases as the size of the respective parking lot
increases.
10.6.1 Applicability
This section applies to:
a. All new parking lots;
b. Existing parking lots that add five (5) or more spaces, within the expansion area only;
and
c. Any change of use, unless the Director finds that the new use requires no additional
parking spaces.
10.6.2 Generally
a. Landscaping, both interior and exterior areas combined, shall comprise a minimum
area of not less than ten percent (10%) of the gross parking lot area.
b. The minimum prepared depth of all planting areas and islands shall be in accordance
with horticultural best management practices.
c. The Director may approve alternative planting island or median configurations if:
1. The number and size of landscaped areas is not reduced; and
2. The configuration is needed to respond to unique topographical or site
conditions; or
3. In lieu of curb and gutter or landscape plantings, the applicant incorporates
bioretention facilities consistent with the principles of Low Impact Design; or
4. The Director determines that the alternative design will provide more effective
screening and shading of parking areas.
d. Parking perimeters, medians, islands and strips shall include a six (6) inch vertical
curb unless uncurbed bioretention areas are included as part of an approved low
impact stormwater management design (Low Impact Design) approved by the City
Engineer. A qualified Engineer shall certify that the bioretention areas comply with
the principles for Low Impact Design.
e. All dimension and area calculations for landscape areas shall be measured
horizontally from the back (inside) of the curb that surrounds the landscape area.
10.6.3 Perimeter Landscaping
10.6.3.1 Applicability  Perimeter landscaping is the portion of the landscaped
area that encircles the area improved for parking. Perimeter landscaping is required on
ARTICLE 10  LANDSCAPING
North Augusta Development Code 10-13
all sides of a parking lot or paved drive that abuts adjoining property, a public right of
way and internal access drives. Exterior landscaping is not required along that portion of
a parking lot where drive aisles or other openings are required. Perimeter landscaping is
required between the parking area and the principal building; provided however, that a
sidewalk not less than five (5) feet in width may be provided in lieu of perimeter
landscaping.
10.6.3.2 Height and Composition  The minimum height, width and composition
of perimeter parking area landscaping shall conform to the requirements of Table 10-7.

10.6.4 Interior Landscaping
10.6.4.1 Generally  All islands and medians required in the interior of parking
areas shall be evenly distributed throughout such parking areas. The distribution and
location of landscaped areas may be adjusted to accommodate existing trees or other
natural features so long as the total area requirement for landscaped islands, peninsulas
and medians for the respective parking area is satisfied.
FIGURE 10-1 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING
10.6.4.2 Minimum Quantity of Landscape Plantings 
a. Landscaped areas shall be covered with mulch, ground cover or sod between shrub
and tree plantings. Landscaped planting areas and islands for Interior Parking Lot
Landscape Areas shall include no less than one (1) large tree, two (2) small trees,

each such island.
d. Islands shall include sod or other vegetative ground cover between required trees.
10.6.5 Waivers
10.6.5.1 In instances where the strict interpretation of this section will seriously
limit the function of the parking area, increase stormwater runoff or create ponding or
pooling of water so as to impair the habitability of buildings or interfere with traffic
circulation, the Director may approve the relocation of a portion of the required interior
parking landscape area to the perimeter parking landscape area provided the minimum
area requirements are not reduced.
10.6.5.2 The parking lot landscaping requirements established in this Article may
be modified in accordance with the provisions of Table 10-9, Screening, based upon the
level of screening provided by principal buildings. Landscaping reductions apply to both
ARTICLE 10  LANDSCAPING

The purpose of street trees is to provide continuity of vegetation along the street right of
way, create a pleasing view from the road and establish a transition from vehicular
thoroughfares, pedestrian areas or the built environment.
10.7.2 Applicability
Subdivision and site plan applications shall include the planting of either subdivision or
street trees. Street trees shall be located in the right of way in the required planting strip
between the curb and the sidewalk or the potential location of a sidewalk if one is not
present in accordance with the design specifications in Article 14, Streets. Subdivision
trees shall be planted in the front setback behind the right of way line and shall be in
addition to other landscaping requirements contained in this Chapter.
10.7.3 Landscape Area Type
There are five (5) different classes of land use for the purposes of determining
subdivision and street tree type, four (4) of which have previously been set forth in Table
10-3, Land Use Class for Determining Buffer Requirements. A fifth class was added in
Table 10-10, Street Tree Landscaping Requirements, and applies to corridor overlay
districts.
10.7.4 Required Plantings
Table 10-10, Street Tree Landscaping Requirements, contains the required plantings
and dimensions of the respective Street Tree types. Either large or small trees, but not
both, are required except in the Corridor Overlay where large trees only shall be

11.1 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS
The purpose of the open space and parks requirements provided in this Article is to
provide standards for the creation and maintenance of open space and park areas in
conjunction with new development that will protect the health, safety and general welfare
of the public, enhance property values, improve the appearance of the community and
preserve natural areas. The requirements will be applied to all new development and
redevelopment.
ARTICLE 11  OPEN SPACE AND PARKS
North Augusta Development Code 11-2
These minimum requirements will:
a. Provide open space, park land and Greeneway access within a reasonable distance
of all new neighborhoods in the city;
b. Maintain a minimal amount of open space in the community to assist in the mitigation
of air, dust, noise, heat and chemical pollution;
c. Preserve existing open space, environmentally sensitive areas, wildlife habitats and
native vegetation as an integral part of the community;
d. Promote water and energy conservation;
e. Screen neighborhoods from incompatible land uses;
f. Maintain and increase property values by requiring park areas, Greeneways and
open space to be incorporated into new development; and
g. Promote passive recreation and walkability in neighborhood design.
11.2 APPLICABILITY
11.2.1 Types of Applications
This Article applies to all applications for general development plans, major subdivision
plans, minor plats, major site plans and minor site plans unless otherwise indicated
below.
11.2.2 Exempt Applications
The following applications are exempt from the requirements of this Article:

TABLE 11-2 OPEN SPACE CATEGORIES AND IMPROVEMENT
AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
A B C
Category
Improvement
Requirements
Maintenance
Requirements
1. Natural Area
Environmentally sensitive
areas left undisturbed as an
amenity for the development.
Natural areas often include
severe topography or
environmentally sensitive
areas. The size and shape of
a natural area is determined
by the land characteristics.
They may be combined with
stormwater management
requirements.
Improvements are minimal
and include removal of
hazards; removal of solid
waste, trash and debris;
minor clearing of understory
plant material to provide
views; and construction of
trails.
Maintenance is limited to
maintaining the natural
character of the open space.
Natural water courses shall
be maintained as free-flowing
and devoid of debris. Natural
areas may be privately owned
or deeded to the city if
accepted by the City Council.
2. Greenbelt
Greenbelts are located on the
edge of a subdivision or
development and provide a
distinct separation between
the development and adjacent
developments or land uses.
Greenbelts are linear, not less
than 50 feet wide at any point
and may include a stream or
other water feature.
Greenbelts are similar to
Natural Areas and require
minimal improvements.
Greenbelts may include a
Greeneway or other passive
recreation amenities
including benches and
viewing areas.
Greenbelts are maintained in
the same manner as natural
areas. Greenbelts may be
privately owned or deeded to
the city if accepted by the City
Council.
3. Greeneway
Greeneways are
pedestrian/bicycle trails that
connect with the citys
Greeneway system. The
Greeneway system links
subdivisions to other
neighborhoods and to activity
centers. Greeneways are
linear, not less than 20 feet
wide at any point, and may
follow a streambed or other
topographical or
environmental feature.
Greeneways shall be
improved to the standards
established and amended
from time to time by the city
for the Greeneway system.
Improvement standards vary
by the designation of the
proposed Greeneway as an
extension of the main
Greeneway, a Greeneway
connector, or a pedestrian
trail. Greeneways are graded
and paved, include
stormwater improvements
and, to the extent
practicable, meet ADA
standards.
Greeneways are maintained
in the same manner as
natural areas and greenbelts
but include repair and
replacement of paving as
needed, maintenance of
stormwater improvements
and regular removal of
barriers and hazards
including fallen trees and
branches. Greeneways may
be privately owned but are
frequently deeded to the city
if accepted by the City
Council. If privately owned,
Greeneways approved as
open space shall permit
public access.

4. Green
A green is a type of park. It is
an improved, passive open
space, often called a square,
surrounded by streets or
buildings or both. It is limited
to a maximum of 1 block in
size and a minimum of 5,000
square feet. Greens should
connect to the Greeneway
system via a Greeneway
connector, pedestrian trail or
sidewalk.
Greens shall be landscaped
with large trees on the
perimeter on no more than
50 foot centers and shall
include an open lawn area at
the center. Greens may
include sidewalks and shall
contain no structures other
than benches, gazebos and
memorials.
Greens are maintained as
improved landscaped areas
as prescribed in §11.8 and
require the periodic repair
and replacement of any
installed fixtures. Greens are
most often privately owned
but may be deeded to the city
if accepted by the City
Council.
5. Park
A park is a public space that
meets the requirement of a
city neighborhood park. The
minimum size of a park is 1
acre. Parks should connect to
the Greeneway system via a
Greeneway connector,
pedestrian trail or sidewalk.
Parks shall be bounded by
streets on a minimum of 50%
of the perimeter. Large trees
shall be planted parallel to all
perimeter rights of way on no
more than 50 foot centers
and include open lawn area
in the center and Natural
Areas on no more than 20%
of the park area. A park may
include a fence, benches,
gazebos and a Playground.
Parks are maintained as
improved landscaped areas
as prescribed in §11.8 and
require the periodic repair
and replacement of fixtures
and equipment. Parks are
frequently dedicated to the
city for ownership and
maintenance if accepted by
the City Council but may be
privately owned.
6. Playground
A playground is an open
space area improved with
playground equipment or other
active open space
improvements. A playground
may be bordered by street
frontages on no more than 2
sides. The minimum size is
5,000 square feet. The
maximum size is 20,000
square feet. Playgrounds
should connect to the
Greeneway system via a
Greeneway connector,
pedestrian trail or sidewalk.
Playgrounds shall include
playground equipment
approved by the Department
of Parks, Recreation and
Leisure Services and shall
include playing surfaces
covered with sand, wood
chips or other approved
material. Basketball or tennis
courts, if included, may be
paved with asphalt or
concrete. Paths and
walkways may be paved in
concrete, crushed gravel,
brick pavers or similar
material.
Playgrounds are maintained
as improved landscaped
areas as prescribed in §11.8
and require regular repair and
replacement of surfaces,
fixtures and equipment.
Playgrounds may be
dedicated to the city for
ownership and maintenance if
accepted by the City Council.

7. Plaza
A plaza is a hard-surfaced
area adjoining the front of
larger buildings, usually
commercial, multifamily or
civic buildings. A plaza may
be bordered on only one side
by street frontage. Building
frontages directly abut the
plaza, rather than facing it
across a street. The minimum
size of a plaza is 2,000 square
feet and the maximum size is
30,000 square feet. The
dimension of a plaza may not
exceed 3 times the height of
the adjacent building(s).
Plazas shall be paved in a
combination of concrete,
brick or other type of pavers.
Plazas shall not be paved
with asphalt. Plazas shall be
level, terraced or gently
sloping at less than a 3%
grade. Plazas shall include
large or small trees that
frame the plaza space or the
structure which the plaza
serves. Plazas may include
other planting areas and
fixtures including benches,
walls and outdoor eating
areas.
Plazas are highly improved
public spaces that require a
higher level of maintenance
than most open spaces.
Plazas are maintained as
improved landscaped areas
as prescribed in §11.8.
Plazas are retained in private
ownership and maintained by
the property owner or
homeowners association.
8. Traffic Circle, Roundabout,
Rotary or Close
A traffic circle, roundabout or
rotary is a relatively small
circular open space area
which organizes through traffic
movement around a center. A
traffic circle is larger than a
rotary and roundabout. A
close is a circular or oval open
space that serves the same
function as a paved cul-de-sac
but most often provides for
access to more lots. All are
generally located within a road
right of way. The minimum
size is 2,000 square feet and
the maximum size is 7,000
square feet.
A traffic circle, roundabout,
rotary or close shall be
improved as part of the street
within which it is located and
landscaped in compliance
with the requirements
established for subdivision
entryways in this Article.
Traffic circles, roundabouts,
rotaries and closes less than
500 square feet and portions

with sod or vegetative
ground cover.
Traffic circles, roundabouts,
rotaries and closes are
maintained as improved
landscaped areas as
prescribed in §11.8. They
may be dedicated to the city
in conjunction with public
streets and other
infrastructure. The city may

provided by the property
owner or homeowners
association.
11.3.2.1 The amount of open space required pursuant to this section may be
satisfied by providing a combination of types of open space for residential and
nonresidential as specified in §11.3.2. Different types of open space require different
levels of improvement, serve different functions and provide different levels of service.
The total required amount of open space may be adjusted by the type of open space
provided. Table 11-3 provides adjustment ratios for the amount of open space required.

b. A fifteen thousand (15,000) square foot Green improved to the standards in Table
11-2 will satisfy an open space requirement of thirty thousand (30,000) square feet
calculated in accordance with §11.3.
11.4 PROXIMITY OF OPEN SPACE
11.4.1 Location
Open space or spaces provided pursuant to this Article shall be located adjacent to or
within the development and within one-quarter (¼) mile (1,320 feet) of every lot or parcel
created or, if the proposed development does not involve a subdivision, every primary
building. The distance shall be measured in a straight line provided that the distance
shall not be interrupted by an arterial street or freeway.
11.4.2 Proximity
The proximity requirement specified in §11.4.1 shall be measured from open space
provided pursuant to this Article or may be measured from preexisting public open space
areas not provided by the applicant. This provision shall not reduce the total area of
open space required for a development pursuant to this Article.
11.5 IMPROVEMENT OF OPEN SPACE PARCELS
11.5.1 Improvements Required
Open space shall be improved as required in Table 11-2. Improved open space shall not
include heated spaces, garages, carports or accessory buildings. Open space areas
may be used to preserve specimen trees and may include existing tree cover areas.
11.5.2 Dedication Option
Unimproved open space may be dedicated to the city when the property to be dedicated
has been identified as necessary to implement a public park, open space, stormwater
management or Greeneway project. The Open Space Credit Ratio for such unimproved
land dedicated to the city shall be one to one (1:1). The property dedicated pursuant to
ARTICLE 11  OPEN SPACE AND PARKS
North Augusta Development Code 11-8
this section need not be located adjacent to or within the development as required by
§11.4 but shall be within the distance limit specified in §11.4.1.
11.6 FEE IN LIEU OF OPEN SPACE
11.6.1 Applicability
In lieu of designating and improving open space lands as required by this Article, the
applicant may pay a fee in lieu of open space for all or any portion of the open space
land required. The fee shall be in the form of cash payment to the city. The Director shall
determine the amount to be deposited, based on the following formula:
FORMULA 11-1 FEE IN LIEU CALCULATION
A x V = M
1. A= The amount of land, in square feet, required for dedication as
determined in §11.3.
2. V = The fair market value of the property, in square feet, to be developed
as determined in §11.6.2.1 or 11.6.2.2.
3. M = The amount to be paid in lieu of dedication of land.
11.6.2 Market Value Determination
For purposes of computing fair market value of property, or V in the equation
established in Formula 11-1, the applicant may select one of the following fair market
value determinations:
11.6.2.1 The actual purchase price of the property to be developed as evidenced
by a purchase contract, or a closing statement dated within one (1) year of the date of
application; or
11.6.2.2 The current fair market value of the property to be developed as
determined by a qualified real estate appraiser retained by the city at the applicant's
expense.
11.6.3 Time of Payment
Fees in lieu of open space shall be assessed at the time of application or during the
period of project application review and paid prior to final approval of the application for
the development.
11.6.4 Administration and Use of Funds
All fees in lieu of open space collected shall be deposited in an appropriate fund and
account by the city and shall be used for the acquisition and development of land for
open space or parks or for the development or construction of improvements on existing
open space land, within one (1) mile of the periphery of the proposed development.
However, if:
a. Such acquisition opportunities are not available; or
b. Existing open space is already developed or improved within one (1) mile of the
proposed subdivision development, then areas within three (3) miles of the periphery
of the proposed subdivision development may be considered for the acquisition of
open space land and/or construction of improvements to existing open space land
within such periphery.
ARTICLE 11  OPEN SPACE AND PARKS
North Augusta Development Code 11-9
11.6.5 Required Expenditure
All fees in lieu of required open space or park land paid must be expended within ten
(10) years from the date of receipt for open space or park facilities benefiting the
development project for which the fees were paid. Fees shall be considered expended if
they are spent for acquisition or development of open space or parks located within the
areas described in §11.6.4 for which the fees were paid. If fees are not expended within
such period, the then-current owner shall be entitled to a refund of the principal
deposited by the applicant in such fund, together with accrued interest. The owner must
request such refund in writing within three hundred sixty-five (365) days of entitlement or
such right shall be waived. All interest accruing funds received pursuant to the fee in lieu
of open space shall be expended on acquisition or development of open space or parks.
11.7 DEED RESTRICTIONS
11.7.1 Covenants and Restrictions
Any lands reserved for open space purposes shall contain appropriate covenants and
deed restrictions approved by the City Attorney ensuring that:
a. The open space area will not be further subdivided in the future;
b. The use of the open space will continue in perpetuity for the purpose specified; and
c. Appropriate provisions will be made for the maintenance of the open space.
11.7.2 Maintenance of Conservation Easements
A conservation easement on unimproved natural area or Greenbelt open space will meet
the requirements of this section provided that adequate provisions for continuing upkeep
and proper maintenance are provided and approved by the City Attorney.
11.8 OPEN SPACE OWNERSHIP
11.8.1 Type of Ownership
The type of ownership of land reserved for open space or park purposes shall be
selected by the owner or developer, subject to the approval of the Director and City
Attorney.

12.1 PURPOSE
This Article established standards for the minimum and maximum number of parking
spaces required for different land uses. It also establishes standards for the size and
configuration of parking spaces and circulation within parking areas to insure adequate
safety to vehicles and pedestrians. The Article provides for shared parking between uses
when uses with different parking demands can share the same parking spaces at
different times of day. The standards also provide for bicycle parking, parking lot
surfacing, parking space and aisle delineation and adequate parking for disabled
individuals.

e. The percentages represent the portion of total minimum parking required for the
generalized category of use during each period.
f. The minimum amount of shared parking required for the combination of uses can be
calculated using the following methodology:
1. Determine the minimum parking requirements in accordance with Table 12-1,
Parking Requirements by Use, for each land use as if it were a separate use;
2. Multiply each minimum required amount by the corresponding percentage for the
use in each of the five (5) time periods set forth in Columns B - F of Table 12-2;
3. Total the minimum required amount for each time period;
4. Select the column with the highest total; and
5. Use the resulting number as the required minimum number of parking spaces for
the combined uses.
12.2.3 Change in Land Use
Whenever a conforming building or use, constructed or established after the effective
date of these regulations, is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees,
number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise, to create a need for an increase
of thirty percent (30%) or more in the number of existing parking spaces, such spaces
shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or change. The expansion and
renovation of nonconforming uses are addressed in Article 19, Nonconforming Uses.
12.2.4 Parking Spaces Reserved for Handicapped
Parking facilities shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C
Subsection 12181 et seq., Pub. L 101-336 and implementing regulations at 28 C.F.R.
parts 35 and 36). Applicants should consult the ADA Technical Assistance Manual from
the U.S. Dept. of Justice on the Internet at www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/taman3.html, and
Technical Assistance Manual for State and Local Governments at
www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/taman2.html.
12.3 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR VEHICULAR PARKING AREAS
12.3.1 Definition
For the purpose of this Chapter, an off-street parking space is an all weather surface
area, not located in a street or service lane, permanently reserved for the temporary
storage of one (1) automobile and connected with a street or service lane by an allweather
surface driveway which affords ingress and egress.
12.3.2 Site Plan
An off-street parking plan shall be required and shall accompany all applications for
development approval. The plan shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements
of Article 5, Approval Procedures, and Appendix B, Application Documents. (Rev. 12-1-
08; Ord. 2008-18)
12.3.3 Size of Spaces
Each off-street parking space shall measure not less than nine (9) feet in width by
eighteen (18) feet in length. Parking spaces designed at an angle to the access aisle
shall provide a rectangular area within the space and exclusive of the access aisle that
measures no less than nine (9) feet in width by eighteen (18) feet in length.

3. 60 18
4. 90 24
12.3.4 Surface, Drainage and Maintenance
12.3.4.1 Off-street parking facilities shall be properly graded for drainage to
prevent damage to abutting property and/or public streets and service lanes, and shall
be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, or other all weather surface approved by the City
Engineer. Off-street parking areas shall include concrete curbs and/or gutters, be
maintained in a clean, orderly and dust-free condition and not be used for the sale,
repair or dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies.
12.3.4.2 In no event will any off-street parking be allowed on an unpaved surface,
except as provided in §12.3.5, or in an area that has not been approved for off-street
parking in accordance with this Article.
12.3.4.3 Overnight parking of large trucks, trailers, shipping containers and similar
vehicles is not permitted unless such vehicles are parked entirely behind a principal
structure and shielded from the street.
12.3.4.4 Wheel stops shall be provided in all parking spaces where necessary to
prevent vehicles from overhanging a sidewalk or damaging landscaping.
12.3.5 Alternative Paving Surfaces
12.3.5.1 Where the principal use creates a light or intermittent demand on the
parking lot, the City Engineer may approve an alternative permanent surface material or
a substitute for concrete curbs, or both, which best fits the needs of the situation. Loose
sand, gravel or similar materials or asphalt curbs shall not be considered suitable
alternative materials.
The City Engineer must find that:
a. The alternative surface will not degrade the public street surface by the dragging or
spilling of loose sand or gravel from the parking area;
b. The alternative surface will adequately withstand the anticipated light or intermittent
parking demand; and
c. The alternative surface will reduce the impervious surface area of the parcel or
parking lot.
12.3.5.2 For purposes of this section, "light or intermittent demand on the parking
lot" means that the use routinely generates an average parking turnover rate of not more
than two (2) per day per space, and an average daily parking utilization rate of fifty
percent (50%) or less or where the Director finds that the daily parking demand is low
enough to warrant the use of an alternative surface.
ARTICLE 12 - PARKING
North Augusta Development Code 12-18
12.3.5.3 The following provisions apply to parking areas where a pervious surface
treatment is applied to the area dedicated for surface parking spaces and drive aisles:
a. Parking lot areas eligible for pervious or permeable surfaces include parking spaces

13.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of sign regulations is to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of
communication in the City of North Augusta; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic
environment; to minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and
private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign
regulations.
These regulations:
1. Establish a permit system that allows a variety of types of signs in commercial
and industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs in residential zones;
2. Allow certain signs that are small and incidental to the principal use of the
properties on which they are located without a requirement for permits; and
3. Provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances on private property and in
the public right of way.
13.2 APPLICABILITY

in the City of North Augusta only in conformance with the standards,
procedures and requirements of these regulations. All signs not expressly
allowed or permitted by this Article are prohibited.
13.2.3 Permit Required
a. No sign shall be placed, installed, erected or constructed on any property
within the City of North Augusta until all the applicable permits, approvals
and certificates required for the particular sign have been issued and
approved.
13.2.4 Signs Allowed Without a Permit
a. Flags and Flagpoles
i. Applicability: a Flag means any flag, including a flag of the United
States, the state of South Carolina, and any other flag sanctioned
by these regulations. Any flag not meeting these conditions shall be
considered a banner sign and shall be subject to regulations as
such. National flags, state and municipal flags, and official flags of
businesses, institutions or other organizations shall not be
considered banners if displayed on a flag pole.
North Augusta Development Code: Article 13: Signs (adopted 12-2-2019) 13-3
ii. One (1) flag and flagpole is allowed on a parcel without
consideration of total signage allowed. Flags and flagpoles in excess
of one (1) shall be included in the maximum square footage of
allowable signage.
iii. All flagpoles shall comply with the setback requirements for
freestanding signs.
iv. Any flag shall not exceed twenty-four (24) square feet in area.
v. Flagpoles may not be flown from a pole more than the maximum
height permitted in the district or forty-five (45) feet, whichever is
less (see §3.5.10.3 and Table 3-3, and Table 3-4).
vi. Flags must be flown in accordance with the protocol established by
the Congress of the United States for the Stars and Stripes or the
state of South Carolina for the state flag.
b. The following types of signs do not require a permit prior to
installation but must comply with any size limits or other
restrictions as contained herein. These signs do not count towards
the Maximum Total Signage allowed.
vii. Construction Signs
viii. Temporary Signs
ix. Signs on Vacant Property
x. Identification Signs
xi. Accessory Signs
xii. Window Signs: Window signs do not require a permit to install,
however, window signage will count towards the Maximum Total
Signage allowed.
13.2.5 Repair and Replacement

b. Any dilapidated or neglected sign shall be repaired or removed. If the
Building Official deems any sign structurally un-sound, it shall be repaired

a. With a valid sign permit, a legal, non-conforming sign may be:
xiii. Re-faced
xiv. Repaired
xv. Repainted, or
xvi. Removed for repair and remounted.
b. Nothing in this section grants the right to technological upgrades such as
the addition of electronic readerboards to an existing sign. Technological
upgrades are the same as erecting a new sign. Changing a light source,
such as changing from fluorescent to LED, with no change in appearance
of the sign, is not considered a technological upgrade.
c. Abandoned Non-conforming Signs shall be removed.
North Augusta Development Code: Article 13: Signs (adopted 12-2-2019) 13-4
13.2.7 Enforcement
a. May be carried out by the Director of Planning and Development or their

subject to any limitation based on the content of the message contained
on such sign. Any sign authorized in this Article may contain noncommercial
copy in lieu of any other copy.
13.2.10 Severability
a. If any word, sentence, section, chapter or any other provision or portion of
this section is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
remaining words, sentences, sections, chapters, provisions or portions
thereof will not be affected and will continue in full force and effect.
13.3 VARIANCES & APPEALS
1. The Director is authorized to vary the dimensional requirements for permitted
signs by no more than 10% if:
a. The Director determines that the proposed waiver does not conflict with
the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan or the purposes
underlying the standard; and
b. The applicant demonstrates, through documentation and/or studies,
based on generally accepted engineering principles, that adherence to the
standard provided by this Chapter would pose a threat to health and safety
or would undermine a policy set forth in the Comprehensive Plan or the
purposes underlying the standard; and
c. The applicant consents to an alternative standard and the Director finds
that such standard is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, will protect
the public health, safety and general welfare, and is consistent with the
purposes underlying the standard; and
d. The economic burden imposed on the applicant to comply with the
generally applicable standard outweighs the public purpose for such
standard; and
North Augusta Development Code: Article 13: Signs (adopted 12-2-2019) 13-5
e. Compliance with the generally applicable standard is impracticable due to
unique topographical or other site conditions.

light source utilized, or both, to provide flexibility to the applicant or to
accommodate an established, registered or trademarked logo or graphic. In
approving waivers the Director shall also consider the objectives of this Section
related to traffic safety, reduction of glare and ambient light, and improved
readability.
3. Variances to this chapter may be issued by the Board of Zoning Appeals as
specified in Article 18 of this Code.
4. Administrative decisions or interpretations of the sign ordinance may be appealed
as specified in Article 18 of this Code.

14.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to:
a. Ensure that the design of streets conforms to the recommendations of the
Comprehensive Plan;
b. Provide for the safety of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
c. Provide for livable residential and commercial environments;
d. Provide economy of land use, construction, and maintenance; and
e. Provide safe and efficient access to property.
Unlike most contemporary subdivision regulations, one (1) intent of this Article is to
permit narrower street widths while requiring greater connectivity in order to more
efficiently disperse traffic, protect pedestrians from high vehicle speeds and enhance the
streetscape.
ARTICLE 14  STREETS
North Augusta Development Code 14-3
14.2 CIRCULATION SYSTEM DESIGN PRINCIPLES
The standards contained in this Article are based on the design principles articulated in
this section. The principles are based on the priorities of the City of North Augusta and
establish the rationale for the standards. Any request for an adjustment to or waiver from
the provisions of this Article shall include an explanation of how the alternative approach
or standards proposed by the applicant conform to the principles explained in this
section.
14.2.1 Shared System
The road system shall respect the function of streets as the shared domain of drivers,
pedestrians and bicyclists. Street widths shall be adequate to accommodate vehicles
and emergency services, but not excessively wide so as to encourage speeding. To the
extent possible the street system shall incorporate pedestrian amenities including
sidewalks, center medians, landscaping strips between the curb and sidewalk, street
trees and narrow intersection radii so as to improve the walkability of the streetscape.
14.2.2 Land Use Context
The street network shall respect the context of the land use and design of the
neighborhood it serves. Streets in new urban and suburban neighborhoods, including
conventional subdivisions, Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TNDs) and Planned
Developments (PDs), shall provide a high level of access, connectivity and a sense of
enclosure in urban design. Streets in rural areas and CR, Critical Areas, shall minimize
negative impacts on the land and maximize the preservation of environmental resources.
14.2.3 Connectivity and Cul-de-Sacs
The street system shall balance the public goal of connectivity with market demands for
privacy. While this Article does not ban cul-de-sacs, cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets
shall be reserved for situations involving unique topography, environmental restrictions
or similar considerations. Wherever possible, cul-de-sacs should be designed as closes.
14.2.4 System Design
The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient and orderly movement of
traffic; to meet, but not exceed, the needs of the present and future population served; to
have a simple and logical pattern; to respect natural features and topography; and to
present an attractive streetscape.
14.2.5 Residential Design
In residential subdivisions, the road system shall be designed to serve the needs of the
neighborhoods while addressing the needs of the citywide circulation pattern necessary
to functionally move traffic.
14.2.6 Pedestrian System Design
The pedestrian system shall be located as required for safety. In standard residential
developments, sidewalks shall be placed parallel to the street, with exceptions permitted
to preserve natural features or to provide visual interest. In PDs, walks may be placed
away from road systems, but they may also be required parallel to the street for safety
reasons.
14.2.7 Bike Paths
ARTICLE 14  STREETS
North Augusta Development Code 14-4
Bike paths shall be required only if specifically indicated to complete the city's approved
Greeneway and bikeway systems.
14.3 STREET HIERARCHY
14.3.1 Classification
Streets are classified in a street hierarchy system with design tailored to function. The
street hierarchy system consists of four categories that, in descending order, include
arterial, collector, subcollector and local streets. These street categories may be
classified further as alleys, lanes, streets, collectors and arterials in accordance with the
Street Design Criteria in Table 14-2. The classification of an existing or proposed street
not previously classified or identified in the Comprehensive Plan, for the purpose of
determining the appropriate design of a roadway or development, or for the purpose of
determining the appropriateness of a location for a proposed use, shall be made by the
Director in consultation with the City Engineer. The functional description of each of the
classes is set forth in Table 14-1, Street Classification.
14.3.2 Design
All streets shall conform to city standards for the street as classified and defined in
Tables 14-1 through 14-4 and as established in §§14.3 through 14.19 of this Article. The
projected annual daily traffic (ADT) volume of a proposed street segment shall determine
the classification. The type of street section proposed under each classification shall be
determined based on the land use, type of residential unit proposed and to provide a mix
of the types of street developed in the city.
14.3.3 Applicability to Private Streets
The requirements of this Article apply to both public and private streets.

1. Local
The local street is the lowest-order
street and usually carries limited
through traffic. Properly designed
local streets provide direct access
to residential lots and short travel
distances from residences to higher
order streets. Traffic speeds are
low, lane capacity and design speed
are not controlling design factors,
and minor delays are
inconsequential considerations.
Drivers and residents expect and
accept both brief delays and the
need to decrease speed. Drivers
are customarily expected to drive
carefully to avoid pedestrians and
children.

2. Subcollector
A subcollector is a relatively lowvolume
street that provides passage
to and between local streets and
also conveys traffic to and from
higher order collectors and arterials.
The subcollector provides frontage
and access to residential lots like a
local street.

3. Collector
The collector is the principal traffic
corridor within residential and
commercial areas. Collectors carry
relatively high traffic volumes and
convey traffic from arterial streets to
lower-order streets. The collectors
primary function is to facilitate the
free flow of traffic. Residential lots
shall not front on collector streets
and access to individual residential
lots shall not be permitted.
Deceleration lanes are required to
provide access to most parcels
fronting on collector streets and
intersecting streets.

interstate highways. Residential lots
shall not front on arterial streets and
access to individual residential lots

c. Where a number is stated as a range, the street may include any dimension or
number within the range at the discretion of the applicant.
d. The design standards for arterial streets shall conform to the specifications required
by the SCDOT.
e. Right of Way  Right of way width depends on the number of travel lanes and
parking lanes provided and is expressed in a range. Right of way width shall be a
minimum of the lesser of the numbers shown. The dimensions are in feet. The right
of way includes the travel lanes, medians, planting strips, sidewalks and bike lanes.
f. Travel Lanes  Refers to the number of travel lanes required. Travel lanes should be
a minimum of nine (9) feet in width for lanes and local streets (Traditional Street
Design Criteria); ten (10) feet in width for alleys, local streets (Conventional Street
Design Criteria) and rural streets; eleven (11) feet in width for subcollectors; and
twelve (12) feet in width for all other streets.
g. Parking Lanes  Refers to the minimum number of parking lanes. If parking lanes are
required they shall be located on the outside of the travel lanes. If two (2) lanes are
required, one (1) parking lane shall be provided on each side of the street. Access,
subcollector and collector streets that include a center median may provide a parking
lane adjacent to each side of the median provided the design speed of the street is
thirty-five (35) miles per hour or less. Parking lanes shall be a minimum of seven (7)
feet in width. In accordance with Section 5.9, the Planning Commission may waive
the requirement for parking lanes and the resulting pavement width may be adjusted
accordingly. (Rev. 3-15-10; Ord. 2010-05)
h. Pavement Width  Refers to the minimum width of the traveled way and any parking
lanes, in feet, from curb face to curb face. All streets listed in Tables 14-1, Street
Classification, and 14-2, Street Design Criteria, shall be paved with a hard surface.
Gravel or other loose surfacing material is not permitted. Surface material for the
various pedestrian walkway types is specified in the table. Where the pavement
width, curb, gutter, planting strip and sidewalk exceed the range of applicable right of
way specified in Row 1, the design of right of way may be increased or the sidewalk
and planting strip may be placed outside the right of way within a dedicated
easement. In such cases, building setbacks may be measured from the inside edge
of the sidewalk. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
i. Corner Radius  Refers to the minimum radius, in feet, of the curb located at the
street intersection of a block corner.
j. Centerline Radius  Refers to the radius described by the radius of the circle formed
by a curve which is tangent to the centerline of the road.
k. Drainage  CG means curb and gutter. SW means swale. SH means shoulder.
Where SH and SW are shown in parentheses they may be permitted by the City
Engineer in consultation with the Director under circumstances specified in §14.7.2.
All curbed streets shall be built in accordance with SCDOT requirements for vertical
curb and gutter construction. Curb and gutters shall be at least eighteen (18) inches
ARTICLE 14  STREETS
North Augusta Development Code 14-10
in width. Curb and gutter sections for lanes and street medians shall be at least
twelve (12) inches.
l. Median  Where median widths are specified, a median of not less than the
designated width shall be provided and shall be landscaped at a density equivalent
to a subdivision entrance as set forth in the Article 10, Landscaping. Medians shall
be a minimum of seventy-five (75) square feet in size. Structures and plantings within
the island shall not obscure the visibility of cars entering a cross street for a distance
of twenty (20) feet back from the curb face of the cross street, unless a larger
setback is required by the City Engineer due to inadequate sight distance as a result
of horizontal or vertical curve alignment or other conflicts.
m. Block Length  Refers to the maximum block length permitted, in feet, for each street
type. Block length is determined by the distance between the rights of way of
intersecting streets. For the purposes of block length, lanes and alleys are not
considered intersecting streets.
n. Sidewalks  Refers to the number of sidewalks required. Sidewalks for boulevards,
avenues and collector streets shall have a minimum width of six (6) feet and a
maximum width of twenty (20) feet. Sidewalks for all other classifications shall have a
minimum width of five (5) feet. Sidewalks shall include additional width where
required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. See §14.10 for sidewalk design
requirements. For main streets, grated tree wells may be used in lieu of planting
strips. For parkways, the sidewalks shall take the form of multi-use Greeneways
which may meander at a distance of between six (6) to fifty (50) feet from the paved
section of the roadway. A minimum six (6) foot paved shoulder shall be included on
any street with a design speed of forty-five (45) miles per hour or greater where curb
and gutter and sidewalk are not provided.
o. Planting Strip  This row refers to the minimum width of the planting strip, located
between the curb and sidewalk parallel with the street.
p. Bike Lanes  On local and subcollector streets, bicyclists should be considered a
normal part of the vehicle mix on the street and, accordingly, no separate lanes or
markings are required. On collector streets, bicyclists shall be accommodated with
five (5) feet wide bike lanes. Applicants may also provide separate routes for
bicyclists in lieu of a bike lane. Bike lanes shall connect with segments of the
Greeneway system that are within the proposed development. Bike lanes shall
conform to the minimum widths specified in Table 14-5, Bikeway Design Width. In
accordance with Section 5.9, the Planning Commission may waive the requirement
for bikeways and pavement width may be adjusted accordingly. (Rev. 3-15-10; Ord.
2010-05)
q. Subdivision and Street Trees  Street trees shall generally be located within the right
of way on both sides of and parallel to the street. Where sidewalks are installed,
street trees shall be located between the sidewalk and the curb. Planting strips for
street trees shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in width unless specified otherwise.

14.5 TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS (TIA)
14.5.1 Applicability
14.5.1.1 A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) is required as part of any application for
approval of a rezoning, subdivision plat, site plan or general development plan (See
§§8.2.1 and 8.7.1.2) where:
a. The Director determines that the proposed development will generate at least fifty
(50) new peak hour trips; or
b. The applicant is requesting or is required to provide more than one (1) access
location or curb cut.
14.5.1.2 See Appendix B, Application Documents, for the required scope and
contents of a TIA.
14.5.2 Improvement Requirements
14.5.2.1 The improvements required to mitigate the traffic impacts of a proposed
development shall be implemented in conformance with the provisions of §8.7.
14.5.2.2 Regardless of the mitigation required pursuant to the adequate public
facilities provisions of Article 8, Adequate Public Facilities, within the identified impact
area, the applicant shall be required to implement and pay for its appropriate share of
the identified necessary traffic improvements within the project site and on all roads,
streets and intersections along the boundary of the project site prior to or concurrent with
the impacts of the development.
14.6 UTILITIES
All public utilities including gas, electric, cable TV, telephone, water and sewer shall be
installed underground within the street or alley right of way or within a utility easement
adjacent to the right of way.
14.7 CURBS AND GUTTERS
14.7.1 Purpose
14.7.1.1 Curb and gutter shall be required on all new streets in accordance with
Table 14-1, Street Classification, for the purpose of providing adequate and acceptable
stormwater drainage, safety, delineation and protection of the pavement edge. Curb
requirements vary according to street hierarchy in accordance with the requirements
ARTICLE 14  STREETS
North Augusta Development Code 14-12
shown in Tables 14-2, Street Design Criteria, and 14-3, Conventional Street Design
Criteria.
14.7.1.2 Curb and gutter shall be constructed in accordance with Appendix D,
Construction Standards.
14.7.1.3 Curb and gutter shall be designed and constructed to provide ramps at all
sidewalk intersections as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42
U.S.C Subsection 12181 et seq., Pub. L 101-336 and implementing regulations at 28
C.F.R. parts 35 and 36).
14.7.1.4 Curbing may also be required by the City Engineer in various locations
for:
a. Stormwater management;
b. To stabilize pavement edge;
c. To delineate parking areas;
d. Ten (10) feet on either side of drainage inlets to facilitate drainage; or
e. At intersections and at tight radii to protect sidewalks, landscaping and private
property.
14.7.2 Flexibility Allowed
14.7.2.1 The City Engineer in consultation with the Director may waive the
requirement for vertical curb and gutter where identified as a drainage alternative in
Table 14-2, Street Design Criteria.
Waivers may be granted in the following situations:
a. On the sides of local and subcollector streets where property adjacent to the edge of
the roadway is reserved or dedicated for use as open space, parks or for stormwater
management;
b. On local and subcollector streets in conservation subdivisions;
c. In single family residential subdivisions where the minimum lot size is no less than
fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet, the lot width at the frontage is no less than one
hundred ten (110) feet and the average daily traffic volume on the street segment is
less than two hundred fifty (250); and
d. Where Low Impact Development techniques are proposed and meet the
requirements of Article 15, Stormwater Management, or other generally accepted
engineering standard.
14.7.2.2 The City Engineer in consultation with the Director may approve and
permit an alternative curb and gutter section where conditions warrant and there is no
negative impact on the function of the street or the stormwater drainage system.
14.8 CURB CUTS, DRIVEWAYS AND OTHER ACCESS LOCATIONS
14.8.1 Applicability
Openings in concrete street curbing for vehicle ingress, egress to property adjacent to
the right of way, commonly referred to as driveways or curb cuts, and other means of
vehicular access to and from property shall be regulated in accordance with this section.
The provisions of this section do not apply to parking areas that connect to an alley in
the D, Downtown Mixed Use District, or in a TND Use Pattern or District.
ARTICLE 14  STREETS
North Augusta Development Code 14-13
14.8.2 Size of Curb Cuts and Other Access Locations
In no case shall a two-way traffic curb cut or other access location be less than twenty
(20) feet or more than forty (40) feet in width. One-way traffic curb cuts or other access
locations shall be no less than ten (10) feet or more than twenty (20) feet in width.
14.8.3 Number and Spacing of Curb Cuts and Access Locations
14.8.3.1 Existing Lots of Record
A lot of record which is a part of an approved plat that does not otherwise limit access
and which was approved by the city and filed for record as of the effective date of this
Article, and which does not have sufficient frontage to meet the driveway spacing
requirements, shall be allowed one (1) driveway. A parcel of record zoned to permit one
(1) single-family residence that fronts on a collector or arterial and has no frontage on
another street of a lesser classification, shall be allowed one (1) curb cut; provided,
however, that the development of the parcel shall include a permanent vehicular turnaround
on the lot to prevent backing onto the collector and this restriction should be
noted on the site plan and building permit. If the parcel has frontage on a local or
subcollector street the driveway shall be located on that frontage.
14.8.3.2 Residential Access
14.8.3.2.1 Driveways from collector and arterial streets providing access to
individual single family and duplex residential lots are prohibited. However, if conditions
are such that vehicular access to such lots cannot be provided other than from the
collector or arterial street, the Director in consultation with the City Engineer may permit
the creation of a shared driveway easement to serve two (2) or more lots from one (1)
curb cut. The shared driveway easement shall include as many lots as possible and
shall be designed to permit access onto the street from the property without requiring a
motorist to execute a backing maneuver. Shared driveway easements shall be included
on the subdivision plat and site plan.
14.8.3.2.2 Many residential developments do not have access to existing or planned
collector and arterial streets and are required to utilize existing subdivisions for access.
To minimize the impact of new development on existing neighborhoods and to ensure
adequate access and emergency access to new developments from a variety of
locations, access will be permitted from existing and planned streets of different
classifications with limitations. Access locations (new streets and driveways) into and
within sections of a new residential development (single-family, duplex, townhouse,
apartment, condominiums or other multifamily) shall provide adequate access based on
the total number of trips generated in the development as shown in Table 14-6,
Residential Access Requirements. The total access score shown in Column B is the
minimum required for approval. Where the total access score cannot be achieved, new
roads internal to the development shall be designed as collectors or arterials as
necessary to provide adequate access. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)

For each 500 trips or portion thereof in excess of 1,500,
one (1) additional access point is required.
Notes to Table 14-6:
a. An access street or drive connecting to a local street is valued at a score of one (1)
point. In no event may the projected additional traffic distribution onto an existing
local street exceed two hundred fifty (250) trips per day or the total traffic on the local
street subsequent to the connection exceeds seven hundred (700) trips per day.
b. An access street or drive connecting to a subcollector street is valued at two (2)
points. In no event may the additional traffic distribution onto an existing subcollector
street exceed one thousand (1,000) trips per day.
c. An access street or drive connecting to a collector street is valued at three (3) points.
d. An access street or drive connecting to an arterial street is valued at four (4) points.
14.8.3.2.3 Developments that cannot achieve the required access score or that
contain more than one hundred fifty (150) units must be designed to include higher level
streets (subcollector, collector or arterial) to provide adequate access and distribution.
14.8.3.2.4 New residential and commercial development shall connect wherever
possible to existing development that has provided stubout street connections to a
property line.
14.8.3.2.5 Street stubouts to provide connections to future development on adjacent
unimproved property shall be provided in new commercial and residential development
and shall be spaced in accordance with the block length provided for the street
classification specified in Table 14-2, Street Design Criteria. Street stubouts to adjacent
property lines may be considered as providing points contributing to a required access
score pursuant to §14.8.3.2.2 if adequate current connections are not available.
14.8.3.2.6 Where a TIA is required for a development pursuant to Article 8,
Adequate Public Facilities, or this Article, the number of required access locations shall
be determined and the spacing established in such a manner as to avoid reducing the
traffic LOS below that established in the TIA.
14.8.3.3 Access Separation
14.8.3.3.1 Parcels fronting on a collector or arterial street will be permitted one (1)
vehicular access location unless the total number of residential and nonresidential trips
generated warrants more than one (1) access location as determined in a TIA. The
ARTICLE 14  STREETS
North Augusta Development Code 14-15
number of access locations permitted may also be increased based on the following
criteria:
a. For parcels with less than two hundred (200) feet of frontage on a single street, one
(1) access location may be permitted.
b. For parcels with a frontage of between two hundred (200) feet and seven hundred
(700) feet on a single street, two (2) access locations may be permitted.
c. For parcels with a frontage of between seven hundred (700) feet and one thousand
four hundred (1,400) feet on a single street, three (3) access locations may be
permitted.
d. For parcels with a frontage of more than one thousand four hundred (1,400) feet, one
(1) access location plus one (1) access location for each seven hundred (700) feet
may be permitted.
14.8.3.3.2 For parcels with a frontage on more than one (1) collector or arterial
street, at least one (1) access location shall be provided on each street. The access
locations on each street may be increased by one (1) access location for each seven
hundred (700) feet of frontage on each street.
14.8.3.3.3 For development located on a corner, the access locations shall be
located so as to maintain a minimum distance from the corner of the intersecting
roadways equal to ninety percent (90%) of the length of the property along the roadway
upon which the proposed driveway approach is to be located, or one hundred twenty-five
(125) feet, whichever distance is less.
14.8.3.3.4 Parcels with frontage on both an arterial or collector street and a
subcollector street may be required to provide an access location on the subcollector
street if the Director in consultation with the City Engineer determines that:
a. The distribution of traffic generated by the development will be improved;
b. The reduction in LOS resulting from the development on the arterial or collector
street(s) is reduced;
c. There is little or no decrease in LOS on the subcollector street; and
d. There is a nominal impact on the land uses adjacent to the subcollector street.
14.8.3.3.5 With the exception of single-family residential driveways and one-way
loops or pairs, the minimum separation of any two (2) curb cuts or other access locations
shall be seventy-five (75) feet.
14.8.3.4 Shared Access  All lots in the D, OC, NC, GC and TC zoning districts
and in the HC overlay districts may, and are encouraged to, provide for shared cross
access with adjacent lots fronting a collector or arterial street, by means of a platted
common access easement across the lots or recorded deed covenants providing
common access across the lot with adjacent lot(s), as a mitigation measure pursuant to
a traffic impact analysis required in Article 8, Adequate Public Facilities or this Article.
14.8.3.5 Additional Access Locations  The Director is authorized to permit
additional access locations under the following conditions:
a. The additional access locations are necessary to ensure the property owner
beneficial use of the land; and
b. The resulting additional ingress and egress of vehicles will not seriously disrupt the
flow of traffic on the street.
ARTICLE 14  STREETS
North Augusta Development Code 14-16
14.8.3.6 Location of Access Locations
14.8.3.6.1 The specific location of access locations will be determined by the
Director at such time as a subdivision or site plan is reviewed prior to approval. The
location shall be based on the following criteria:
a. The location shall minimize conflicts with vehicle turning movements;
b. The location shall be located as far as practicable from intersections; and
c. The location shall be not less than seventy-five (75) feet from another driveway
location, however, if this is not possible, based upon the frontage of the property, the
access location shall be located as far as practicable from other driveway locations.
14.8.3.6.2 Driveways providing access from a collector or an arterial street shall
provide a deceleration lane with the taper and storage lengths in accordance with the
design standards and specifications of SCDOT. Such deceleration lanes may be
provided within the existing right of way or on the parcel being developed. The width of a
deceleration lane provided outside the right of way and inside the property line of a
parcel shall not be included in any required setback or landscape area unless otherwise
permitted in this Chapter.
14.8.3.6.3 Driveways on a collector or an arterial street within four hundred (400)
feet of an intersection with an arterial or collector street may be restricted to right turn
movements.
14.8.3.7 Driveway Throat and Vehicle Storage Length
14.8.3.7.1 For purposes of this section, Throat Length means the distance along
an entry drive from the entry into the site to the first left-turn conflict or intersection with
another street, driveway or parking aisle. Vehicle Storage Length means the length of a
driveway, service lane, bay or other passageway for motor vehicles which is designed to
minimize queuing onto surrounding streets. Throat length shall be designed in
accordance with the anticipated storage length for entering and exiting vehicles to
prevent vehicles from backing into the flow of traffic on the public street or causing
unsafe conflicts with on-site circulation. Throat length and vehicle storage length shall
not be less than the standards set forth in Table 14-7, Minimum Driveway Throat
Lengths, unless approved by the Director. These measures generally are applicable to
the principal access drives to a property and are not intended for minor driveways.

Comment: The throat lengths in Table 14-7 are provided to assure adequate stacking
space within driveways for general land use intensities. This helps prevent vehicles from
stacking into the thoroughfare as they attempt to access the site. High traffic generators,

Council upon recommendation by the Mayor, shall serve four (4) year terms, or until

18.4.3 Order of Interpretation
It is the intention of this Chapter that all questions arising in connection with the
enforcement of this Chapter shall be presented first to the Director and that such
question shall be presented to the Board of Zoning Appeals only on appeal from the

18.4.4 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to protect the rights of applicants, landowners and affected
persons by providing procedures for appeals from decisions of administrative officials
and variances from the provisions contained in Articles 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 13, 18 and 19 of this
Chapter. Appeals from the provisions of all other articles contained in this Chapter shall
be considered by the Planning Commission in accordance with §5.9. This section
implements the provisions of S.C. Code §6-29-800 and applies to the following appeals:
a. Appeals from and review of any order, requirement, decision or determination made
by an administrative official charged with enforcing this Chapter;
b. An application for a variance from a requirement of Article 3, Zoning Districts; or

a. A notice of appeal of an administrative decision relating to an application for
development approval shall be submitted to the Director within thirty (30) days from

Director.
c. An application filed by an agent shall be accompanied by written designation of the
agent signed by the applicant or party in interest.

grounds for dismissal by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
18.4.5.2 Completeness Review  Within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of
the application, the Director shall review the application and shall determine if the
application is complete pursuant to this section. The Director shall inform the applicant of
the status of the completeness of the application. If the application is complete and
conforms to this Chapter, the Director shall initiate the application review process. If the
application is incomplete or does not conform with the provisions of this Chapter, the
Director shall return it to the applicant with a statement of the reasons why the
application is incomplete or otherwise does not conform to the provisions of this Chapter.
The Directors statement will provide the information necessary for the applicant to
ARTICLE 18  ADMINISTRATION
North Augusta Development Code 18-6
revise and resubmit the application. Any communication purporting to be an application
for an appeal shall be regarded as mere notice to seek relief until it is made in the form
required.
18.4.5.3 Decision  The application shall be scheduled for consideration by the
Board of Zoning Appeals at the next regularly scheduled monthly meeting following
receipt of a complete application, provided that the complete application is submitted at

The Board of Zoning Appeals shall render its decision within thirty (30) days after the
initial hearing date unless extended by the applicant or by majority vote of the Board of
Zoning Appeals for good cause shown. If no decision has been made within the thirty
(30) days, the request shall automatically be considered approved by the Board of
Zoning Appeals and the Board shall direct that the necessary permits be issued. The
Board of Zoning Appeals shall conduct a hearing on the appeal pursuant to the
procedures established in S.C. Code §6-29-800 and §5.1.4 of this Chapter.
18.4.5.4 Approval Criteria 
18.4.5.4.1 Appeal from Administrative Decision or Interpretation 

is error in an order, requirement, decision or determination made by an
administrative official of the city in the enforcement of this Chapter.
b. In an appeal regarding an administrative decision or interpretation, the Board of
Zoning Appeals scope of review shall be limited to determining whether the decision
or interpretation by the Director was in accordance with the intent and requirements
of this Chapter, and accordingly, the Board will affirm, modify or reverse the decision.
c. In exercising its powers, the Board of Zoning Appeals, in conformity with this
Chapter, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement or decision of the Director or other administrative official and to that end
shall have all powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or
direct the issuance of a permit.
18.4.5.4.2 Variance 
a. A variance is not a right. It may be granted to an applicant only if the applicant
establishes compliance with the hardship criteria established in S.C. Code §6-29-
800.
b. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals for variances from the
requirements of Article 3, Zoning Districts, and Article 13, Signs, when strict
application of the regulations would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance may
be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the Board of Zoning
Appeals makes and explains in writing, all of the following:
1. An unnecessary hardship exists;
2. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular
piece of property;
3. The conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity;
4. Because of the conditions, the application of this Chapter to the particular piece
of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the
property; and
ARTICLE 18  ADMINISTRATION
North Augusta Development Code 18-7
5. The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent
property or to the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed
by the granting of the variance. Harm to the character of the district may include
structures that are significantly out of scale, and the creation or potential for the
creation of excessive noise, light, traffic or incompatible late night activity. (Rev.
12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
c. In the approval of an application for a variance from the provisions of Article 13,
Signs, regulating the size, height, appearance, or location of a sign, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall also find that no alternative signage solution that complies with
the provisions of Article 13 is available and would provide adequate visibility,
recognition and understanding.
d. The Board of Zoning Appeals may not grant a variance the effect of which would be:
1. To allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in a zoning district.
2. To extend physically a nonconforming use of land.
3. To change zoning district boundaries shown on the official zoning map.
e. If the unnecessary hardship is self imposed by the applicant the variance should not
be granted.
f. The fact that property may be utilized more profitably, should a variance be granted,
shall not be considered grounds for a variance.
g. In granting a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach to it such conditions
regarding the location, character, or other features of the proposed building,
structure, or use as the Board may consider advisable to promote the public health,
safety, or general welfare.
18.4.5.4.3 Special Exception 
a. Special exceptions are subject to additional scrutiny to insure that the health, safety
and general welfare of the community and the area where the special exception use
is proposed will not be harmed.
b. Permits for special exceptions shall be evaluated by the Board of Zoning Appeals on
the basis of the following criteria:
1. That the special exception complies with all applicable development standards
contained elsewhere in this Chapter and with the policies contained in the
Comprehensive Plan. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18)
2. That the special exception will be in substantial harmony with the area in which
it is to be located.
3. That the special exception will not discourage or negate the use of surrounding
property for use(s) permitted by right.
c. In granting a special exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such
additional stipulations, conditions, or safeguards that, in its judgment, will enhance
the proposed special exception use and promote the public health, safety or general
welfare.
18.4.5.5 Approval 
a. The approval of an appeal from an administrative decision shall be effective
immediately and the Director shall implement the decision of the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
b. The approval of a variance shall establish the conformity of an existing
nonconforming use or structure. The approval of a variance associated with new
construction shall authorize the applicant to apply for site plan approval pursuant to
§5.6 of this Chapter. No building permit may be issued until the site plan is approved.
ARTICLE 18  ADMINISTRATION
North Augusta Development Code 18-8
The approval of a variance does not automatically authorize any development
activity.
c. Minor field alterations or minor revisions to approved variances or conditions
associated with a variance may be approved by the Director if the project still meets
the intent of the variance approval.
d. Violations of any of the conditions applied to a conditional use permit shall be treated
in the manner as set forth in §§5.1.6 and 5.11 of this Chapter.
18.4.5.6 Order and Recordation 
a. The secretary shall draft the order of the Board of Zoning Appeals regarding the
decision on an appeal and any conditions applied to the approval.
b. The order shall be signed by the chairman and the secretary and shall include the
legal description and accompanying map exhibit. The order shall be retained in the
official records of the City Clerk and the Department.
c. The secretary shall deliver a copy of an order to each party in interest by certified
mail immediately upon execution of the order by the chairman.
d. The secretary shall provide the applicant a copy of the order.

request is brought and approved or the property is brought into compliance with this
Chapter through renovation or redevelopment or amendment to this Chapter. (Rev.
2-21-11; Ord. 2011-01)

the associated site plan, if any, shall expire two (2) years from the date of approval
unless a building permit has been issued and construction has commenced or, if no
construction is required, the approved variance or special exception has been initiated.
The applicant may apply for and the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant extensions on
such approval for additional periods up to one (1) year each but not to exceed five (5)
extensions. If an amendment to this Chapter is adopted by the City Council subsequent
to the variance or associated site plan approval that would preclude the initial approval,
a request for an extension may not be granted. (Rev. 8-16-10; Ord. 2010-12)

a petition in writing setting forth plainly, fully, and distinctly wherein such decision is
contrary to law. Such appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the decision of the
Board is rendered.
18.5.8 Subsequent Applications
In the event that an application for an appeal from an administrative decision, variance
or special exception is denied, the Department shall refuse to accept another application
for the same appeal of an administrative decision, variance or special exception on the
same property or any portion of the same property within one (1) year of the original
hearing. However, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consider such an application within
that time period if it finds there is new and different evidence that was not reasonably
available at the time of the original hearing. (Adopt. 2-21-11; Ord. 2011-01)

19.1 PURPOSE
19.1.1 Permitted Continuation
It is the purpose of this Article to permit nonconforming uses to continue, under regulations
herein contained, until the same are voluntarily or involuntarily removed, but not to
encourage their perpetual survival.
19.1.2 No Enlargement or Extension
It is further the intent of this Article that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged,
extended, reconstructed or be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
ARTICLE 19  NONCONFORMING USES
North Augusta Development Code 19-2
19.1.3 Incompatible with Permitted Uses
Nonconforming uses are hereby declared to be incompatible with the permitted uses in
the districts involved.
19.2 APPLICABILITY
19.2.1 Nonconforming Uses Defined
Within districts established by this Chapter or amendments thereto, there exist lots,
structures, site improvements, activities and uses of land or structures, and characteristics
of uses, which were lawful before the effective date this Chapter was enacted, amended
or otherwise made applicable to such lots, structures, improvements, activities and uses
of land or structures, but which now do not conform to the regulations of the district in
which they are located. These lots, structures, site improvements, activities and uses of
land or structures are defined as nonconforming uses, nonconforming buildings or
structures or nonconforming site improvements.
19.2.2 Determination of Nonconforming Uses
Nonconforming uses and activities shall be determined pursuant to the Use Matrix, Table
3-2.
19.2.3 Determination of Nonconforming Lots, Building and Structures
Nonconforming lots, buildings and structures, except signs, which are governed by Article
13, shall be determined by the prescribed dimensional and design standards for lots,
buildings and structures located in base zoning districts, special zoning districts, and
overlay zoning districts provided for in this Chapter.
19.2.4 Determination of Nonconforming Site Improvements
Nonconforming site improvements shall be determined by the prescribed improvement
standards related to parking, drainage, landscaping, buffers and other standards
contained in this Chapter.
19.3 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
19.3.1 Preexisting Nonconforming Lot
Where a lot of record at the time of the effective date of this Chapter has less area, width
or depth than herein required in the district in which it is located, and the owner of such lot
does not own any other parcel or tract adjacent thereto, said lot may nevertheless be used
for any use permitted within the district in which it is located, provided that the setback
requirements as provided for in Table 3-5 are reduced by no more than forty percent
(40%).
19.3.2 Subsequent Nonconforming Lot
Where the owner of a lot that was subdivided subsequent to the effective date of this
Chapter does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the dimensional
requirements of Table 3-5, such lot may be used as a building site provided the proposed
structure conforms to the minimum setback requirements only after a variance has been
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to §18.4.5.4.2.
ARTICLE 19  NONCONFORMING USES
North Augusta Development Code 19-3
19.3.3 Required Combination of Subsequent Nonconforming Lots
If the owner of two (2) or more adjoining undeveloped lots with substandard dimensions,
any one (1) of which was subdivided subsequent to the effective date of this Chapter,
wishes to build upon any of the nonconforming lots, the lots must be combined and if the
resulting lot or lots conform to the dimensional requirements of Table 3-5, Maximum
Number of Flag Lots, they may be used as a building site or sites. If the resulting lot or
lots does not conform to the dimensional requirements of Table 3-5, the owner may appeal
for a variance pursuant to §19.3.2.
19.4 WAIVER OF SETBACK REQUIREMENT
19.4.1 Waiver for Minor Error
An unintentional error in the location of a structure, as it relates to any applicable setback
requirement, which was overlooked during the review of a building permit application, or
was discovered during or after construction, and provided that the mislocation of the
structure results in a reduction of the required setback of no more than ten percent (10%)
of the specific applicable setback requirement, is classified as a "minor error." Waivers
for minor errors may be approved by the Director.
19.4.2 Waiver for Major Error
An unintentional error in the location of a structure, as it relates to any applicable setback
requirement, which was overlooked during the review of a building permit application, or
was discovered during or after construction, provided that the mislocation of the structure
results in a reduction of the required setback of more than ten percent (10%) of the specific
applicable setback requirement, is classified as a "major error." Waivers for major errors
may be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon application of the property owner
or the Director.
19.4.3 Approval Criteria
In granting a waiver of setback requirement, the Director or the Board of Zoning Appeals,
as applicable, must find that:
a. the error was unintentional; and

2. Table identifying proposed site development and corresponding ITE land use
code, land use description, land use size, and trip generation potential as per the
latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual at the time the traffic study is
performed. This table should show any adjustments for passby or internal
capture. Passby may be limited to a twenty percent (20%) maximum for twentyfour
(24) hour volumes and thirty-five percent (35%) maximum for PM peak hour
volumes. Internal Capture must follow ITE recommended practices and a
worksheet must be included in the appendix of the report.
3. Provide a diagram indicating the potential AM and PM peak period trip
assignments within the study area for trips generated by development under
existing zoning.
4. If applicable, provide a diagram indicating the passby volumes (Passby Traffic)
and total site generation traffic (Site Traffic) volumes distributed within the study

plus existing zoning;
c. Existing conditions plus approved development plus proposed zoning; and
d. Horizon year conditions with all approved development and proposed zoning.
3. All capacity analyses included in the traffic study must be performed utilizing
software based on the methodology of the latest edition of the Highway Capacity
Manual (identify the software and version utilized for the study). This capacity
analysis must utilize actual lane widths, field signal timings, adjacent parking and
bus blockage, where applicable. Any other modifications to default values for
adjustment factors should be noted within the body of the report.
4. If the signalized intersections analyzed function as part of a coordinated system,
then the analysis must reflect the effects of coordination on system operation.
5. Results of the capacity analysis must be presented in a summary table for each
development scenario. These results should be provided in the form of level of
service (LOS), average delay, and volume/capacity (v/c) ratio for each
intersection and individual intersection movement. Lane improvements should be
identified for any movements/intersections which exceed v/c ratios under existing
conditions.
6. Due to the limitations of unsignalized capacity analysis, it may be necessary to
analyze some unsignalized intersections. Proper treatment of unsignalized
locations within the study area will be discussed during the preliminary meeting.
7. Capacity analyses must be provided in electronic as well as hardcopy.
i. Other Traffic Analysis (if applicable).
a. Where existing turn lanes need to be lengthened or new ones are necessary,
provide recommended storage lengths. Cite the methodology for the storage
length evaluation and include any calculations where applicable. This analysis
should include the feasibility of the turn lanes where possible conflicts may arise
with overlapping transitions, competing storage or other restrictions such as right
of way restrictions or utilities.
b. Analysis must be performed to address the safety and operational impacts of any
new proposed median breaks or relocations.
j. Conclusions
1. Identify traffic impacts of the proposed development and any lane improvements
or operational modifications necessary to mitigate these impacts.
2. Provide a diagram identifying all necessary lane improvements found as a result
of the study.
3. The Director will review any recommendations for traffic signals that may be
included in the traffic study. However, the installation of a traffic signal(s) will not
be approved by Director through this review process. The Director will consider
the installation of a traffic signal following build-out of any appropriate land
development project provided that MUTCD signal warrants are met using current
traffic volumes; signal spacing/progression is not adversely affected as
determined by the Director; necessary intersections/turn lane improvements are
in place or are constructed; sufficient internal channelization is provided; and that
it will not adversely affect traffic flow/public safety. Meeting traffic signal warrants
will not be the sole criteria for the installation of a traffic signal. The Director may
APPENDIX B  APPLICATION DOCUMENTS
North Augusta Development Code B-23
elect not to require installation of a traffic signal for reasons including, but not
limited to, those described above and require that some vehicular movements be
prohibited instead.
k. Appendix
1. Include any intersections counts performed or referenced as part of the study.
2. Include printouts of the capacity analysis for each scenario studied in the report 
for each with intersection/analysis period listing/within page numbers.
3. Include any other calculations used as part of the traffic study with the exception
of calculations for historical background traffic growth.

E.1 GENERALLY
E.1.1 Scope
This appendix provides guidance for implementing erosion and sediment control
measures in conjunction with land disturbing and construction activities permitted
pursuant to Article V of Chapter 14 and Article 15 of this Chapter.
E.1.2 Modifications
The City Engineer may add to or modify the contents of this appendix when appropriate
and for valid reasons to clarify or update best management practices associated with
erosion and sediment control measures in land disturbing and construction activities.
Such modifications shall be documented and forwarded to the Planning Commission as
information. In specific cases and for documented reasons, the City Engineer may waive
the submission of documents or specific activities required herein. The reasons for any
such waiver shall be recorded in the project application file.
E.2 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
E.2.1 Introduction
The practice of erosion and sediment control on construction sites has fallen under
increasing scrutiny from federal, state, and local governments as well as the general
public. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC)
has had authority over permitting for construction sites conducting land disturbing
activities since the mid 1990s. On July 1, 2004 the City of North Augusta Stormwater
Management Department (SMD) received delegation of the stormwater program from
the SCDHEC. From this point forward the North Augusta SMD will review land
disturbance applications for compliance with Chapter 14, Article V, Division 3 of the
North Augusta Code of Ordinances entitled Construction Permitting For Land Disturbing
Activities. This manual should be used as a guidance document for appropriate Best
Management Practice (BMP) selection for erosion and sediment control.
Because this field is rapidly changing, the presence or absence of any BMP, or
specifications for any BMP in this document is subject to revision as additional
information becomes available. One failing on all too many construction sites is that
when one BMP fails, it is simply reinstalled as it was before. How many of us have seen
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-3
the same section of silt fence be resurrected again and again and again and again with
no more hope for success than it had in the beginning?
E.2.1.1 Discussion  Unlike engineering standards, BMPs do not have uniform
specifications, quantifiable effluent limits, nor do they have predictable effectiveness.
BMPs do however require design. The designer must have an understanding of the BMP
design considerations, installation techniques, construction specifications and
maintenance requirements in order to design erosion control practices that "fit the site"
and are thereby effective in reducing erosion and sedimentation.
BMPs are 'performance-based' construction standards. They require constant monitoring
and evaluation. If they don't work, adapt them or move up to the next level of BMP
protection. Many BMPs originated over 35 years ago. Time has proven that some are
not effective and have fallen into disuse. Other BMPs, which have also proven to be
marginally effective, are still widely used today. Their use has been perpetuated for a
myriad of reasons. Contractors are comfortable installing them and the designers have
become complacent, often designing the erosion control as an after thought to the "real"
project work. Take silt fence, for example:
Silt fence is one of the most widely used BMPs for non-point source pollution protection.
However, from a practical point, it is probably the least effective measure in use across
the nation. Typical silt fence installation renders it ineffective. The fences are not
trenched and compacted. Improper application of silt fence frequently results in
increased erosion. The optimum method of silt fence installation is via the slicing
method where a pull behind machine makes a narrow cut into the soil leaving the
surrounding soil undisturbed and stronger. At a minimum trenching is required.
E.2.1.2 Applications of Erosion and Sediment Control Practices 
Frequently, the wrong BMP is implemented for the type of control needed. A sediment
control BMP should not be used for erosion control and an erosion control BMP should
not be used when runoff control is needed. When the needed control is treated with the
wrong type of BMP, failure usually occurs.
For example, a silt fence is placed across a slope to prevent erosion. Maybe the
designer wanted to stop sheet and rill erosion. In actual practice the silt fence collected
and concentrated water which was diverted to a low spot where the fence becomes
overloaded and fails. An Erosion Control BMP should have been chosen to treat the
erosion problem. Silt fences are intended for sediment control and should, therefore, be
installed in relatively flat areas suitable for ponding water and depositing sediment.
A good way to avoid confusion when choosing BMPs is to have a clear understanding of
what type control is needed and what the corresponding BMPs are. There are three
general categories of controls that have distinct treatments associated with them; 1)
erosion control, 2) runoff control, and 3) sediment control.
E.2.1.3 Water Quality Impacts Due to Erosion and Sedimentation  Water
quality may be impacted during construction activities by sediment runoff from erosion of
the site and pollutants from materials stored or used on site during construction. Post
construction water quality impacts are due to the runoff of silt, fertilizers, pesticides,
fuels, antifreeze, metals, and other pollutants. Impervious areas facilitate the transport
of pollutants into aquatic environments.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-4
During construction disturbing the land reduces a sites natural resistance to erosion by
removing the vegetative ground cover, exposing the soil, and changing the topography.
The severity of erosion depends on the type of soil, the amount and intensity of rainfall,
length and gradient of slopes, and surface cover.
Water quality effects due to construction site runoff include:
a. Sediment deposition in the storm drainage system clogs pipes and inlets causing
inlet bypassing and erosion and results in increased maintenance costs.
b. Impacts to aquatic organisms due to an increase in turbidity. Turbid water interferes
with respiration and filter feeding behavior of macroinvertebrates as well as reduces
fish feeding success due to visual impairment. Turbidity decreases photosynthesis
for primary producers. Sediment deposition fills pools and interstitial spaces in the
stream bottom necessary for macroinvertebrates and juvenile fishes. Sedimentation
of shallow areas chokes out aquatic vegetation.
c. Many pollutants, especially metals, are bound to and transported with sediments.
d. Stream paths may be altered by excessive sedimentation.
e. Sedimentation of wetlands reduces their ability to filter runoff and recharge
groundwater.
The primary purpose of this Manual is to present effective Best Management Practices
(BMPs), which may be used during construction and after to reduce pollutant discharges
to the city storm, drain system, wetlands, and streams.
E.2.1.4 Erosion and Sediment Control Plans  The erosion control plan or
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) must be prepared before construction
begins, ideally during the project planning and design phases. The erosion control plan
shall be submitted along with the rest of the project package during engineering and
planning departmental review. The Stormwater Management Department will review the
SWPPP as other city departments review other aspects of the project. This applies to
commercial and subdivision infrastructure projects. They need not be submitted for prior
approval. For all projects, sediment and erosion control BMPs shall be installed upon
clearing. Once BMPs are installed the Stormwater Management Department shall be
contacted to conduct an inspection (803-441-4246). No additional building inspections
will be conducted without a satisfactory initial BMP inspection.
If the site or portion of the site is planned to be idle for more than 21 days, then
vegetative stabilization must be accomplished within seven days. The wet weather plan
should include a plan for the immediate (within 24 hours of the first forecast of a storm
front) installation of emergency erosion control measures.
E.2.2 Land Grading and Site Preparation BMPs
Soil is most vulnerable during site preparation as the vegetation is removed and soil is
disturbed loosening bonds, which help undisturbed soil to resist erosion. The types of
BMPs chosen at this early stage form the foundation of a successful erosion and
sediment control plan.
E.2.2.1 Scheduling 
a. Definition  Sequencing the construction project to reduce the amount and duration
of soil exposed to erosion by wind, rain, runoff, and vehicle tracking. The
construction sequence schedule is an orderly listing of all major land-disturbing
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-5
activities together with the necessary erosion and sedimentation control measures
planned for a project. This type of schedule guides the contractor on work to be
done before other work is started so that serious erosion and sedimentation
problems can be avoided. This BMP must be seriously considered for any project
exceeding 5 acres.
b. Purpose  Following a specified work schedule that coordinates the timing of landdisturbing
activities and the installation of control measures is perhaps the most costeffective
way of controlling erosion during construction. The removal of surface
ground cover leaves a site vulnerable to accelerated erosion. Construction
procedures that limit land clearing provide the timely installation of erosion and
sedimentation controls, and restore protective cover quickly can significantly reduce
the erosion potential of a site.
c. Design Considerations  Design project to integrate into existing land contours.
Significant regrading of a site will require more costly erosion and sedimentation
control measures and may require installation of on-site drainage and sediment
control facilities. Incorporate existing natural areas: Inventory and evaluate the
existing site terrain and vegetation. Disturbance of highly erosive natural areas (e.g.,
steep, unstable slope areas and watercourses) should be minimized, while protecting
other areas may enhance site aesthetics. Construction should not disturb these
areas.
d. Avoid rainy periods:
1. Allow enough time before rainfall begins to stabilize the soil with vegetation or
physical means or to install temporary sediment trapping devices.
2. Apply perimeter control practices: Protect the disturbed areas from off-site runoff
and prevent sedimentation damage to areas below the development site by
applying perimeter control devices.
3. Minimize soil exposed at one time: Schedule projects to disturb only small
portions of the site at any one time. Complete grading as soon as possible.
Immediately stabilize the disturbed portion before grading the next portion.
Practice staged seeding in order to revegetate cut and fill slopes as the work
progresses.
E.2.2.2 Minimize Disturbance and Buffer Strips 
a. Definition  Minimizing disturbance and maintaining a buffer strip is a planning
process which retains natural vegetative cover and also maintains vegetative buffer
strips near watercourses.
b. Purpose  Erosion can be reduced 98% by protecting the soil from raindrop impact.
Existing native vegetation usually provides the best soil protection. One of the most
effective erosion control measures is to only disturb areas immediately needed for
construction. Water quality and wildlife habitat degradation can be greatly reduced by
maintaining streamside buffer strips and riparian corridors. These buffer strips act to
filter sediment from the surface runoff before it reaches the watercourse. The small
drainage and intermittent streams are the sediment delivery systems to the streams
and wetlands. If sediment can be kept out of the delivery systems, by maintaining
buffer strips, then the sediment will not impact riparian areas or cause other water
quality impacts.
c. Planning Considerations  Existing native vegetation should be incorporated into
the final landscape plan. It is adapted to the site, drought tolerant, and will provide
shade and erosion protection. Existing trees should be protected as per development
requirements. If the area is not disturbed then it does not require erosion control and
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-6
concentrated flows down slope will be greatly reduced. Buffer strips around the
perimeter of a site can reduce or eliminate off-site sedimentation.
d. Construction Specifications/Design Criteria 
1. Designate areas of no disturbance. Clearly show on the plans, and flag in the
field areas of no disturbance and construction vehicle exclusion.
2. Designate trees and shrubs that are to be preserved.
3. Designate watercourse buffer-filter strips on the site design plan.
4. Maintain and preserve riparian and naturally vegetated buffer strips along
watercourses.
5. The Guide to Small Roads, USDA-SCS, also provides information for sizing
buffer strips.
6. The width of a buffer strip between a road and the stream is recommended to be
50 feet plus four times the slope of the land in percent, measured between the
road and the top of stream bank.
7. Buffer width in feet (m) = 50 + 4(% slope).
8. Example: For a 10% slope, buffer length is 50 feet + (4) (10) = 90 feet.
E.2.2.3 Land Grading for Minimizing Erosion 
a. Definition  Land grading for minimizing erosion is grading that is intended to
minimize the impacts of surface erosion and runoff.
b. Purpose  Where land grading is necessary for road or building construction, these
land grading practices are intended to minimize the erosion potential and facilitate
plant establishment.
c. Design Considerations 
1. Design considerations should include the following:
2. Development should fit existing topography as much as possible so that land
disturbance is minimized.
3. Slope steepness and excessive slope lengths should be kept to a minimum.
Benches, steps, or contour furrows can be installed on long slopes to break up
the slope length.
4. A bench should be graded back towards the slope and drain with a gentle
gradient to a stable outlet.
5. Drainage from upland areas should be diverted away from exposed slopes.
d. Construction Specifications 
1. Only disturb, clear, or grade areas necessary for construction. Flag or otherwise
delineate areas not to be disturbed. Exclude vehicles and construction equipment
from these areas to preserve natural vegetation.
2. All graded or disturbed areas including slopes shall be protected during clearing
and construction in accordance with the approved erosion and sediment control
plan until they are permanently stabilized.
3. All sediment control measures shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan and according
to the standards and specifications for the appropriate erosion control practices.
4. If topsoil is required for the establishment of vegetation, it shall be stockpiled in
the amount necessary to complete finished grading and protected from erosion
during the interim.
5. Areas to be filled should be cleared, grubbed to remove trees, vegetation, roots
and other objectionable material, and stripped of topsoil. The outer face of the fill
slope should be allowed to stay loose, not rolled, compacted, or bladed smooth.
A bulldozer may run up and down the fill slope so the dozer treads (cleat tracks)
create grooves perpendicular to the slope. If the soil is not too moist, excessive
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-7
compaction will not occur. Use slope breaks, such as diversions, benches, or
contour furrows as appropriate, to reduce the length of cut-and-fill slopes to limit
sheet and rill erosion and prevent gully erosion. Slopes in excess of 2:1 may
require hydroseeding, hydromulching, tackifying, and/or "punching-in" straw,
bioengineering techniques, or retaining walls. Roughen the surface of all slopes
during the construction operation to retain water, increase infiltration, and
facilitate vegetation establishment.
6. Stabilize all graded areas with vegetation, crushed stone, riprap, or other ground
cover as soon as grading is completed or if work is interrupted for 21 working
days or more. Use mulch to stabilize areas temporarily where final grading must
be delayed. Stockpiles, borrow areas and spoil areas shall be shown on the
plans and shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and sedimentation.
FIGURE E-1 STEPPED OR TERRACED SLOPE
E.2.2.4 Surface Roughening 
a. Definition  Surface Roughening is a technique for roughening a bare soil surface
with furrows running across the slope, stair stepping, or tracking with construction
equipment.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-8
b. Purpose  Surface Roughening is intended to aid the establishment of vegetative
cover from seed, to reduce runoff velocity and increase infiltration, and to reduce
erosion and provide for sediment trapping.
c. Conditions Where Practice Applies  All construction slopes require surface
roughening to facilitate long-term stabilization with vegetation, particularly slopes
steeper than 3:1.
d. Planning Considerations  Rough
slope surfaces are preferred
because they aid the establishment
of vegetation, improve water
infiltration, and decrease runoff
velocity. Graded areas with smooth,
hard surfaces may be initially
attractive, but such surfaces
increase the potential for erosion. A
rough, loose soil surface gives a
mulching effect that provides more
favorable moisture conditions than
hard, smooth surfaces; this aids seed germination.
There are different methods for achieving a roughened soil surface on a slope, and
the selection of an appropriate method depends upon the type of slope. Roughening
methods include stair-step grading, furrowing, and tracking. Factors to be considered
in choosing a method are slope steepness, mowing requirements, and whether the
slope is formed by cutting or filling.
e. Construction Specifications 
1. Cut Slope Roughening:
a. Stair-step grade or groove the cut slopes that are steeper than 3:1.
b. Use stair-step grading on any erodible material soft enough to be ripped with
a bulldozer. Slopes consisting of soft rock with some subsoil are particularly
suited to stair-step grading.
c. Groove the slope using machinery to create a series of ridges and
depressions that run across the slope, on the contour.
2. Fill Slope Roughening:
a. Place fill slopes with a gradient steeper than 3:1 in lifts not to exceed 8 inches
(0.2 m), and make sure each lift is properly compacted.
b. Ensure that the face of the slope consists of loose, uncompacted fill 4-6
inches (0.1-0.2 m) deep.
c. Use grooving or tracking to roughen the face of the slopes, if necessary.
d. Apply seed, fertilizer and straw mulch then track or punch in the mulch with
the bulldozer. Do not blade or scrape the final slope face.
f. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Periodically check the seeded slopes for rills and washes. Fill these areas slightly
above the original grade, then reseed and mulch as soon as possible.

FIGURE E-3 SURFACE ROUGHENING DETAIL
E.2.2.5 Temporary Gravel Construction Entrance/Exit 
a. Definition  A temporary gravel construction entrance/exit is a stabilized pad of
crushed stone located at any point where traffic enters or leaves a construction site
onto a public right-of-way, street, alley, sidewalk, or parking area.
b. Purpose  A stabilized construction entrance is intended to reduce off-site
sedimentation by eliminating the tracking or flowing of sediment onto public rights-ofway.
c. Design Considerations  Construction plans should limit traffic to properly
constructed and stabilized entrances, especially during wet weather operations.
d. Construction Specifications 
1. The aggregate size for construction of the pad shall be 2-3 inch stone. Place the
gravel to the specific grade and dimensions shown on the plans, and smooth it.
2. The thickness of the pad shall not be less than 6 inches. Use geotextile fabrics, if
necessary, to improve stability of the foundation in locations subject to seepage
or high water table. The width of the pad shall not be less than the full width of all
points of ingress or egress and in any case shall not be less than 12 feet wide.
The length of the pad shall be as required, but not less than 50 feet for larger
projects and 30 feet for individual residential lots.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-10
3. Locate construction entrances and exits to limit sediment leaving the site and to
provide for maximum utility by all construction vehicles. Avoid entrances which
have steep grades and entrances at curves in public roads.
4. The entrance shall be maintained in a condition that will prevent tracking or
flowing of sediment onto public rights-of-way. This may require periodic top
dressing with additional stone as conditions demand, and repair and/or
maintenance of any measures used to trap sediment.
5. All sediment spilled, dropped, washed or tracked onto public rights-of-way shall
be removed immediately.
6. Provide drainage to carry water to a sediment trap or other suitable outlet.
7. When necessary, wheels shall be cleaned to remove sediment prior to entrance
onto public rights-of-way. When washing is required, it shall be done on an area
stabilized with crushed stone that drains into an approved sediment trap or
sediment basin.
8. All sediment shall be prevented from entering any storm drain, ditch or
watercourse through use of sand bags, gravel, straw bales, or other approved
methods.
e. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Maintain the gravel pad in a condition to prevent mud or sediment from leaving
the construction site.
2. Replace gravel material when surface voids are visible.
3. After each rainfall, inspect any structure used to trap sediment and clean it out as
necessary.
4. Immediately remove all objectionable materials spilled, washed, or tracked onto
public roadways. Remove all sediment deposited on paved roadways within 24
hours.

E.2.3 Vegetative Establishment BMPs
E.2.3.1 Vegetation as a Solution 
a. Dense, healthy vegetation and the associated leaf litter protects the soil from
raindrop impact. Raindrop impact is a major force in dislodging soil particles which
then allows them to move downslope or form a crust on the soil surface. When a
crust forms on the soil surface the rainfall infiltration rate decreases and runoff
increases.
b. Vegetation also protects the soil from sheet and rill erosion. It shields the soil surface
from the transport of soil particles and scour from overland flow (sheet flow) and it
decreases the erosive energy of the flowing water by reducing its velocity.
c. The shielding effect of the plant canopy and leaves is augmented by roots and
rhizomes that hold the soil in place, improve the soils physical condition, and
increase the rate of infiltration, further decreasing runoff. Plants also remove water
from the soil through transpiration, thus increasing its capacity to absorb water.
d. Suitable vegetative cover provides excellent erosion protection, and reduces the
need for high cost and high maintenance sediment control measures.
e. Exposed subsoils are generally difficult to amend, are infertile, and require more
irrigation.
E.2.3.2 Seeding for Erosion Control: General Seeding Guidelines 
a. Timing Guide Lines  Before planting all construction should be completed so as to
not disturb the planting area. Temporary Erosion Control Seeding should be applied
on sites intended to lie dormant for over 21 days. Permanent Erosion Control
Seeding should be applied on sites intended to be dormant for over 1 year. Mulch
can also provide for the short-term erosion control need. Both mulch and annual
grasses provide a microclimate that is more suitable for the establishment of
perennial plants.
b. Soil Amendments  Before any soil amendments are applied on a site an
appropriate soil test should be completed to determine appropriate lime and
fertilization rates. It is important to provide minimum amounts of nitrogen (N),
phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) to plants. This is especially true on disturbed
sites that are generally deficient.
c. Quality of Seed Mixes  Seeds containing prohibited or restricted noxious weeds
should not be accepted. Seed should not contain in excess of 0.5% weed seed.
Seed should have a minimum acceptable pure live seed (PLS) of 80%. This is
calculated by multiplying the minimum seed purity (%) and the minimum germination
(%) rates from the seed tag. Divide by 100 to get the percent PLS. For example:
Seed A is tagged 99.48% purity and 81% germination. Therefore, (99.48 x 81) / 100
= 80.57% PLS which is within acceptable limits. Seeds with less than 80% PLS will
require the quantity to seed be increased to meet specifications.
d. Planting Considerations 
1. Seed should be planted at acceptable rates per SCDOT or by using Table E-1.
2. Seed should be drilled, harrowed, hydroseeded with a tackifier, or covered with
mulch that is anchored by discing.
3. If rainfall is not adequate, the area must be irrigated.
4. For final stabilization, both temporary and permanent seed must be used.

E.2.3.3 Hydraulic Planting 
a. Definition  Hydraulic planting is a method of applying erosion control materials to
bare soil and establishing erosion-resistant vegetation on disturbed areas and critical
slopes.
b. Purpose  By using hydraulic equipment (hydroseeders and hydromulchers) seed,
soil amendments, wood fiber mulch and tackifying agents, bonded fiber matrix and
liquid co-polymers can be uniformly broadcast, as a hydraulic slurry, onto the soil.
These erosion and dust control materials can often be applied in one operation.
Hydraulic planting is effectively used to establish vegetation intended to control
erosion on steep, critical slopes that cannot practically be treated with other
methods. Hydraulic planting techniques, such as hydroseeding and hydrosprigging,
are also used to establish stands of turf grass.
c. Conditions Where Practice Applies  Hydraulic planting is a very effective method
for applying seed and mulch material. This practice will uniformly distribute seed
which can then be covered with protective mulch, ensuring favorable conditions for
quick germination and growth. Hydraulic planting is relatively more expensive than
manual seeding and mulching, however, hydraulic planting generally requires less
seedbed preparation - the soil surface may be left irregular with large clods, stones
or rock outcroppings exposed.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL

d. Hydraulic planting techniques should be considered for temporary and permanent
erosion control, seeding and mulching for sites with the following conditions:
1. Slopes steeper than 3:1 that cannot receive adequate seedbed preparation and
the mulch would be difficult to otherwise anchor.
2. Where the slope surface is irregular with large clods, stones or a high percentage
of rock.
3. Where site conditions such as, irregular soil surfaces, existing vegetation, and
shallow soils preclude the installation of erosion control blankets and mats.
4. On sites where other soil stabilization, seeding, and mulching practices would
require unacceptable levels of disturbance.
5. On sites where it is desirable to apply water, seeds and mulch in one operation.
6. On critical erosion sites where the application of seed, fiber, fertilizer followed by
the application of straw mulch and tackifier (the three-step process) is desirable.
7. On sites where straw mulch has been applied and the straw needs to be
anchored (tacked) with tackifiers or hydraulic mulches.
8. On sites where dust control is desired.
e. Design Considerations  Hydraulic machines are used to spray seed, tack down
straw, bind the soil, seal the soil, or apply blanket-like coats of bonded fiber matrix
(BFM). These materials are usually applied by spraying a slurry, often in one
application.
f. Types of Hydraulically Applied Materials for Erosion and Dust Control:
1. Seed and Fertilizer: Applying seed and fertilizer with water has many benefits.
The seed blend can be distributed uniformly, the added mass increases accuracy
and throw distance, especially for exposed, windy areas, and the presoaking and
water accelerates germination and enhances the chance of survival.
2. Mulches: Hydraulically applied mulches include mulches made from wood fibers,
paper fibers, combination recycled wood and paper fibers, and polyester and/or
polypropylene fibers.
3. Tackifiers: Tackifiers are typically used to anchor or glue mulch to increase
effectiveness of erosion control. Tackifiers used in conjunction with straw mulch
are extremely effective in bonding the straw to itself and the soil surface, thus
resisting movement by water or wind. Liquid formulations of acrylic co-polymers
can also be specified alone to control erosion and dust. These products
chemically bond and stabilize the soil surface.
4. Cementious Binders: These products are formulated from hydrated lime or
gypsum mixed with water and applied to the soil with hydraulic equipment. Fiber
mulch, seed and fertilizers can be applied with the slurry and sprayed on in one
application. These cementious binders form a permeable crust on the soil
surface which control water and wind erosion.
5. Bonded Fiber Matrix (BFM): Hydraulic matrix products are typically produced
from longer fibers combined with tackifiers and binding agents that are
hydraulically applied and conform to the ground and dry to form a bonded fiber
matrix. Seed and fertilizer can be added to the slurry and applied with the BFM
in one-step application.
g. Site Preparation  Grade as needed and feasible to permit the use of equipment for
seedbed preparation. Install needed erosion control practices, such as sediment
basins, diversion dikes and channels, prior to seeding. Divert concentrated flows
away from hydraulic planted areas. Conduct soil tests to determine pH. Add
amendments as necessary to adjust pH. The seedbed should be firm but not
compact. The top 3 inches of soil should be loose, moist and free of large clods and
stones.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-16
h. Planting 
1. Seed to soil contact is important for successful germination.
2. Use dormant seeding techniques for late fall or winter seeding schedules.
3. Use seed rates based on pure live seed (PLS) of 80%. When PLS is below 80%,
adjust rates accordingly.
i. Hydraulic Mulching  The mulch should be mixed with seed, fertilizer and additives
as specified and applied at a rate recommended by the manufacturer in order to
achieve uniform, effective coverage and provide adequate distribution of seed. Apply
straw mulch binders (tackifiers) heavier at the edges, in valleys and at the crest of
banks.
j. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Hydraulically treated areas shall be inspected and monitored after installation
and periodically thereafter.
2. If the hydraulic mulch or tackifiers were applied as stand alone (without
vegetation) treatments for erosion and dust control, the products longevity must
match the length of time that the soil will remain bare or until revegetation
occurs. Periodic inspections will assure the intended purposes will be met.
3. Areas which fail to establish cover adequate to prevent erosion shall be reseeded
and re-mulched as soon as such areas are identified.
E.2.3.4 Mulching 
a. Definition  Mulching is the application of a protective layer of straw or other
suitable material to the soil surface. Straw mulch and/or hydromulch are also used in
conjunction with seeding and hydroseeding of critical areas for the establishment of
temporary or permanent vegetation. Mulching with straw or fiber mulches is
commonly used as a temporary measure to protect bare or disturbed soil areas that
have not been seeded.
b. Purposes  To temporarily stabilize bare and disturbed soils, to protect the soil
surface from raindrop impact, to increase infiltration, to conserve moisture, to prevent
soil compaction or crusting, and to decrease runoff. Mulching also fosters growth of
vegetation by protecting the seeds from predators, reducing evaporation, and
insulating the soil.
c. Design Considerations  Mulch can be applied to any site where soil has been
disturbed and the protective vegetation has been removed. The most common use
of mulch is to provide temporary stabilization of soil, usually until permanent
stabilizing vegetation is established. Where mulches are used to compliment
vegetation establishment, they should be designed to last as long as it takes to
establish effective vegetative erosion control. Where mulches are used as surface
cover only (i.e. bark, wood chips, or straw mulch cover) the serviceable duration of
the application and maintenance requirements, including augmentation or replication
should be specified. On steep slopes, greater than 2.5:1, or where the mulch is
susceptible to movement by wind or water, the mulch material should be
hydraulically applied or the straw mulch should be appropriately anchored. Hydraulic
fiber mulches and/or tackifying agents are used effectively to bind the straw together
and prevent displacement by wind or rain.
d. Construction Specifications 
1. Straw: Straw is an excellent mulch material. Because of its length and bulk, it is
highly effective in reducing the impact of raindrops and in moderating the
microclimate of the soil surface. Straw mulch can be applied by hand on small
sites and blown on by machine on large sites. Mulch should not be applied more
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-17
than 2 inches deep on seeded sites, unless it is incorporated into the soil by
tracking, disking, or other punching in techniques.
2. Anchoring:
a. Straw mulch must be anchored immediately to minimize loss by wind or
water. Straw mulch is commonly anchored by:
b. crimping, tracking, disking, or punching into the soil;
c. covering with a netting;
d. spraying with asphaltic or organic tackifier;
e. tacking with cellulose fiber mulch at a rate of 750 lbs/ac.
3. Hydraulic Mulches from Wood and Paper Fiber: These combination mulches are
generally comprised of 70% wood fiber and 30% paper fiber, manufactured from
lumber mill waste, virgin wood chips, recycled newsprint, office paper and other
waste paper. The mulch is mixed in a hydraulic applicating machine
(hydroseeder) and applied as slurry in combination with the recommended seed
and fertilizer. The mulch can be specified with or without a tackifier.
a. Inspection and Maintenance  If properly applied and anchored, little additional
maintenance is required during the first few months. After high winds, or significant
rainstorms, mulched areas should be checked for adequate cover and re-mulched if
necessary. Mulch needs to last until vegetation develops to provide permanent
erosion resistant cover. Straw mulch can last from 6 months to 2 years. Erosion
control blankets are effective for up to 2 years.

E.2.4 Stormwater Conveyance BMPs
E.2.4.1 Grass-lined Channels 
a. Definition  Vegetation lining a natural or constructed waterway, swale or dike to
protect it from erosion.
b. Purpose  Grass protection of drainageways reduces erosion by lowering water
velocity over the soil surface and by binding soil particles with roots. The
drainageway is any ground surface over which concentrated runoff travels. It is
typically a manmade waterway, swale or ditch. It may also be the upslope flow of
water and directs the concentrated flow along the surface of the barrier.
c. Grass-lined channels should be used where:
1. A vegetative lining can provide sufficient stability for the channel grade by
increasing maximum permissible velocity;
2. Slopes are generally less than 5%;
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-19
3. Site conditions required to establish vegetation i.e., climate, soils and topography
are present.
d. Grass lined channels may be reinforced using either:
1. Cellular confinement systems (geocells) which significantly improve the hydraulic
performance of vegetation by confining the soil layer within the cellular structure.
Confinement and anchorage of the root structure increases the limiting shear
resistance of the protection and the permissible flow duration. Geocell systems
are recommended for swales, ditches and on upper slopes of large channels
where flows are intermittent, of low to moderate intensity, and of relatively short
duration (<24 hours).
2. Erosion control blankets which can be selected for low to medium velocity
intermittent flows. Permanent to temporary biodegradable options are available.
Proper installation of ECBs is crucial to long-term success. Channels with design
velocities greater than 2 ft/sec. will require that turf reinforcement mats, erosion
control blankets, or netting be installed at the time of seeding to provide stability
until the vegetation is fully established. It may also be necessary to divert water
from the channel until vegetation is established or to line the channel with sod.
Whenever design velocities exceed 4 ft/sec. a permanent type of erosion control
blanket or turf reinforcement mat will be necessary.
e. Design Considerations  Grass-lined channels resemble natural systems and are
usually preferred where design velocities are suitable. Select appropriate vegetation
and construct channels early in the construction schedule before grading and paving
increase runoff rates. Generally, grass-lined channels are constructed in stable, low
areas to conform to the natural drainage system, but they may also be needed along
roadways or property boundary. To reduce erosion potential, design the channel to
avoid sharp bends and steep grades. The channel cross section should be wide and
shallow with relatively flat side slopes so surface water can enter over the vegetated
banks without erosion. Riprap may be needed to protect the channel banks at
intersections where flow velocities approach allowable limits and turbulence may
occur. Cross-section designs include:
1. V-shaped  Generally used where the quantity of water is relatively small, such
as roadside ditches. The V-shaped cross section is desirable because of
difficulty stabilizing the bottom, where velocities may be high. A grass or sod
lining will suffice where velocities are low or rock or riprap lining may be
necessary.
2. Parabolic  Often used where larger flows are expected and sufficient space is
available. The shape is pleasing and may best fit site conditions. Riprap should
be used where higher velocities are expected and where some dissipation of
energy (velocity) is desired. Combinations of grass with riprap centers or turf
reinforcement mat centers are useful where there is a continuous low flow in the
channel.
3. Trapezoidal  Used where runoff volumes are large and slope is low so that
velocities are non-erosive to vegetated linings. Trapezoidal channels generally
have concrete or riprap lined center for low flow.
4. Grass-lined channels must not be subject to sedimentation from disturbed areas.
An established grass-lined channel resembles natural drainage systems and is
usually preferred if design velocities are below 5 ft/sec. Outlets should function
with a minimum of erosion. Sediment traps may be needed at channel inlets and
outlets to prevent sedimentation.
f. Additional Design Criteria 
1. Capacity: Sufficient to convey 10 year - 24 hour storm.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-20
2. Velocity: The allowable design velocity for grass-lined channels is based on soil
conditions, type of vegetation, and method of establishment. If design velocity of
a channel to be vegetated exceeds 2-4 ft./sec., a channel liner is required.
3. Depth: The design water surface elevation or a channel receiving water from
diversions or other tributary channels shall be equal to or less than the design
water surface elevation of the diversion or other tributary channel at the point of
intersection.
4. Cross-section: The channel shape may be parabolic, trapezoidal, or V-shaped,
depending on need and site conditions.
5. Side Slopes: Grassed channel side slopes generally are constructed 3:1 or flatter
to aid in the establishment of vegetation and for maintenance.
6. Grade: Generally restricted to slopes 5% or less. Either a uniform or gradually
increasing grade is preferred to avoid sedimentation.
g. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. During the initial establishment, grass-lined channels should be repaired and
grass re-established if necessary.
2. After grass has become established, the channel should be checked periodically
to determine if the channel is withstanding flow velocities without damage.
3. Check the channel for debris, scour, or erosion and immediately make repairs. It
is particularly important to check the channel outlet and all road crossings for
bank stability and evidence of piping or scour holes and make repairs
immediately.
4. Remove all significant sediment accumulations to maintain the designed carrying
capacity.
5. Keep the grass in a healthy, vigorous condition at all times, since it is the primary
erosion protection for the channel. Permanent grassed waterways should be
seasonally maintained by mowing, depending on the type of vegetation selected.

E.2.4.2 Rock-lined Channel 
a. Definition  Rock-lined channels are channels or roadside ditches lined with rock or
riprap.
b. Purpose  To convey concentrated surface runoff without erosion.
c. Conditions Where Practice Applies 
1. This practice applies where design flow exceeds 2 ft./sec (.61 m/sec) such that
channel lining is required, but conditions are not suitable for vegetative
protection. Specific conditions include:
2. All roadside ditches or drainage channels greater than 2% and located in highly
erodible soils that have a low maximum permissible velocity.
3. The channel design velocity exceeds that allowable for a grass-lined channel.
4. The channel will continue to down-cut without protection because it is adjusting
to increased flow or a new base line (outlet elevation).
d. Design Criteria 
1. Capacity: peak runoff from 10-year storm.
2. Side slopes: 2:1 or flatter.
3. Stone size: d= 2 inch (50 mm) minimum. Use engineering design procedures for
sizing riprap for large or critical drainage channels. Riprap thickness: T= 1.5
times the stone diameter or as shown on the plans; 6 inch (150 mm) thick
minimum.
4. Foundation: Extra-strength filter fabric or an aggregate filter layer, if required.
5. Outlet must be stable.
e. Construction Specifications 
1. Excavate cross section to the grades shown on plans. Overcut for thickness of
rock and filter.
2. Place filter fabric or gravel filter layer, and rock as soon as the foundation is
prepared.
3. Place rock so it forms a dense, uniform, well-graded mass with few voids. Hand
placement may be necessary to obtain good size distribution.
4. Channel outlet shall be stabilized.
f. Inspection and Maintenance  Inspect channels at regular intervals and after major
storms. Remove debris and make needed repairs where stones have been
displaced. Take care not to restrict the flow area when stones are replaced. Give
special attention to outlets and points where any concentrated flow enters the
channel. Repair eroded areas promptly. Check for sediment accumulation, piping,
bank instability, and scour holes and repair promptly.

E.2.4.3 Temporary Diversion Dike 
a. Definition  A temporary ridge of compacted soil constructed immediately above a
new cut or soil fill slope or around the perimeter of a disturbed area.
b. Purposes 
1. To divert storm runoff from upslope drainage areas away from unprotected
disturbed areas and slopes to a stabilized outlet.
2. To divert sediment-laden runoff from a disturbed area to a sediment-trapping
facility such as a sediment trap or sediment basin.
3. An upslope dike can improve working conditions at the construction site and
prevent erosion.
4. A downslope dike assures that sediment-laden runoff will not leave the site
without treatment.
c. Planning Considerations  It is very important that a temporary diversion dike be
stabilized immediately following installation with temporary or permanent vegetation
to prevent erosion of the dike itself. The gradient must have a positive grade to
assure drainage, but if the gradient is too great, precautions must be taken to
prevent erosion due to high velocity channel flow behind the dike. Temporary
diversion dikes are often used as a perimeter control in association with a sediment
trap or a sediment basin, or a series of sediment-trapping facilities, on moderate to
large construction sites. If installed properly and in the first phase of grading,
maintenance costs are very low.
d. Design Considerations 
1. Drainage Area: 5 acres or less recommended Dike Design:
a. side slope: 2:1 or flatter
b. width: 2 foot (.6 m) (top width) minimum
c. height: 1.5 feet (.5 m) minimum
d. freeboard: 0.5 feet (.2 m) minimum
2. Grade: The channel behind the dike shall have a positive grade to a stabilized
outlet. If the channel slope is less than or equal to 2%, no stabilization is
required. If the slope is greater than 2%, the channel shall be stabilized.
3. Outlet: Divert sediment-laden water into a temporary sediment trap or sediment
basin. Runoff from undisturbed areas should empty into an outlet protection
unless well stabilized natural outlets exist.
e. Construction Specifications 
1. Temporary diversion dikes must be installed as a first step in the land-disturbing
activity.
2. The dike should be adequately compacted to prevent failure.
3. Temporary or permanent seeding and mulch shall be applied to the dike
immediately following its construction.
f. Inspection and Maintenance 
4. The measure shall be inspected after every storm and repairs made to the dike,
flow channel, outlet or sediment trapping facility, as necessary.
5. Diversion Dikes used to trap sediment shall be inspected and cleaned out after
every storm.
6. If vegetation has not been established, reseed damaged and sparse areas
immediately.

FIGURE E-9 TEMPORARY DIVERSION DIKE
E.2.4.4 Slope Drain 
a. Definition  A temporary slope drain is a flexible tubing, pipe, overside drain, or
other conduit extending from the top to the bottom of a cut or fill slope.
b. Purpose  To convey concentrated runoff down the face of a cut or fill slope without
causing erosion.
c. Conditions Where Practice Applies  This practice applies to construction areas
where stormwater runoff above a cut or fill slope will cause erosion if allowed to flow
over the slope. Temporary slope drains are generally used in conjunction with
diversions to convey runoff down a slope until permanent water disposal measures
can be installed.
d. Planning Considerations  Constructed slopes are often exposed to erosion
between the time they are graded and permanently stabilized. During this period,
the slope is very vulnerable to erosion, and temporary slope drains together with
temporary diversions can provide valuable protection. It is very important that these
temporary structures be sized, installed, and maintained properly, because their
failure will usually result in severe erosion of the slope. The entrance section to the
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-27
drain should be well-entrenched and stable so that surface water can enter freely.
The drain should extend downslope beyond the toe of the slope to a stable area or
appropriately stabilized outlet. Other points of concern are failure from overtopping
from inadequate pipe inlet capacity and lack of maintenance of diversion channel
capacity and ridge height.
e. Design Criteria 
1. Capacity: Peak runoff from the 10-year storm. See reference material for
determining the peak runoff.
2. Pipe size: Unless they are individually designed, size drains according to Table
E-2.
TABLE E-2 DRAIN SIZE
A B
Maximum Drainage Area per Pipe Pipe Diameter Inches (Meters)
1. 0.50 ac. (0.20 ha) 12 (.36)
2. 0.75 ac. (0.30 ha) 15 (0.45)
3. 1.00 ac. (0.40 ha) 18 (0.54)
4. >1.00 ac* (>0.40 ha) as designed
*Inlet design becomes more complex beyond this size.
3. Conduit: Construct the slope drain from heavy-duty, flexible materials such as
non-perforated, corrugated plastic pipe, or open top overside drains with tapered
inlets, or CMP. Install reinforced, hold-down grommets or stakes to anchor the
conduit at intervals not to exceed 10 feet (3 m) with the outlet end securely
fastened in place. CMP or corrugated plastic pipe must have one (1) anchor
assembly for every 20 feet (6 m) of slope drain. The conduit must extend beyond
the toe of the slope.
4. Entrance: Construct the entrance to the slope drain of a standard flared-inlet
section of pipe with a minimum 6 inch (150 mm) metal toe plate. Make all fittings
watertight. A standard T-section fitting may also be used at the inlet. An open
top flared inlet for overside drain may also be used.
5. Temporary Diversion: Generally, use an earthen diversion with a dike ridge or
berm to direct surface runoff into the temporary slope drain. Make the height of
the ridge over the drain conduit a minimum of 1.5 feet (0.5 m) and at least 6
inches (150 mm) higher than the adjoining ridge on either side. The lowest point
of the diversion ridge should be a minimum of 1 foot (300 mm) above the top of
the drain so that design flow can freely enter the pipe.
6. Outlet Protection: Protect the outlet of the slope drain from erosion with an
energy dissipater.
f. Construction Specifications 
1. A common failure of slope drains is caused by water saturating the soil and
seeping along the pipe. Proper backfilling around and under the pipe haunches
with stable soil material and hand compacting in 6 inch (150 mm) lifts to achieve
firm contact between the pipe and the soil at all points will reduce this type of
failure.
2. Place slope drains on undisturbed soil or well-compacted fill at locations and
elevations shown on the plans.
3. Slightly slope the section of pipe under the dike toward its outlet.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-28
4. Compact the soil under and around the entrance section in lifts not to exceed 6
inches (150 mm).
5. Ensure that fill over the drain at the top of the slope has a minimum depth of 1.5
feet (0.5 m) and a minimum top width of 4 feet (1 m). The sides should have a
3:1 slope.
6. Ensure that all slope drain connections are watertight.
7. Ensure that all fill material is well compacted. Securely fasten the exposed
section of the drain with grommets or stakes spaced no more than 10 feet (3 m)
apart.
8. Extend the drain beyond the toe of the slope and adequately protect the outlet
from erosion.
9. Make the settled, compacted dike ridge no less than 1 foot (300 m) higher than
the top of the pipe inlet.
10. Immediately stabilize all disturbed areas following construction.
g. Inspection and Maintenance  Inspect the slope drain and supporting diversions
after every significant rainfall and promptly make necessary repairs. When the
protected area has been permanently stabilized, temporary measures may be
removed, materials disposed of properly, and all disturbed areas stabilized
appropriately.

E.2.4.4 Waterbars and Rolling Dips 
a. Definition  Waterbars and rolling dips are ridges or ridge-and-channels constructed
diagonally across a sloping road or utility right-of-way that is subject to erosion.
b. Purpose  To limit the accumulation of erosive volumes of water on roads by
diverting surface runoff at predesigned intervals.
c. Planning Considerations  Construction of access roads, power lines, pipelines,
and other similar installations often requires clearing long narrow right-of-ways over
sloping terrain. Roads concentrate runoff. Gully formation may be especially severe
in tire tracks and ruts. To prevent gully erosion, runoff can often be diverted across
the width of the right-of-way to undisturbed areas by using waterbars or rolling dips.
A waterbar is a berm and excavation built diagonally across the road. Waterbars
generally become less effective if driven over during wet weather, and are difficult to
cross with low clearance vehicles. Rolling dips are gently sloping excavations
running diagonally across the road surface, and are more appropriate for winter use.
Rolling dips are more difficult to construct, but are much easier to traverse and
require less maintenance. Give special consideration to each individual outlet area,
as well as to the cumulative effect of added diversions. Never outlet waterbars or
rolling dips onto unprotected fill slopes. Use gravel to stabilize the diversion where
significant vehicular traffic is anticipated.
d. Design Criteria 
1. Waterbar Height: 18 inch (0.5 m) minimum measured from the channel bottom to
the ridge top.
2. Side Slope: 2:1 or flatter; 3:1 or flatter where vehicles cross.
3. Base width of ridge: 6 foot (2 m) minimum.
4. Spacing of waterbars/rolling dips is shown in the table below.
TABLE E-3 SPACING OF WATERBARS/ROLLING DIPS
A B C
Slope (%) Spacing ft. (m) Spacing High Erodible ft. (m)
1. <5 125 (38.1) 100 (30.5)
2. 5 to 10 100 (30.5) 75 (22.9)
3. 10 to 20 75 (22.9) 50 (15.2)
4. 20 to 35 50 (15.2) 25 (7.6)
5. >35 25 (7.6) 25 (7.6)
5. Outlet: Diversions should have stable outlets, either natural or constructed. Site
spacing may need to be adjusted for field conditions to use the most suitable
areas for water disposal into brush or onto an energy dissipator.
e. Construction Specifications 
1. Install the diversion as soon as the right-of-way has been cleared and graded.
2. The waterbars and rolling dips should be built at an angle of 45 to 60 degrees
from the centerline.
3. The diversion should have a positive grade of 2% minimum.
4. For rolling dips the height from channel bottom to the top of the settled ridge shall
be 18 inches (0.5 m) and the side slopes of the ridge shall be 2:1 or flatter.
f. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Inspect after every heavy rainfall for erosion damage.
2. Check outlet areas and make timely repairs as needed.

E.2.4.5 Energy Dissipator 
a. Definition  An energy dissipator is a structure designed to control erosion at the
outlet of a channel or conduit.
b. Purpose  To prevent erosion at the outlet of a channel or conduit by reducing the
velocity of flow and dissipating the energy.
c. Conditions Where Practice Applies  This practice applies where the discharge
velocity of a pipe, box culvert, diversion, open channel, or other water conveyance
structure exceeds the permissible velocity of the receiving channel or disposal area.
d. Planning Considerations  The outlets of channels, conduits, and other structures
are points of high erosion potential, because they frequently carry flows at velocities
that exceed the allowable limit for the area downstream. To prevent scour and
undermining, an outlet stabilization structure is needed to absorb the impact of the
flow and reduce the velocity to non-erosive levels. The riprap apron should be
extended downstream until stable conditions are reached, even though this may
exceed the length calculated for design velocity control. Riprap-stilling basins or
plunge pools reduce flow velocity rapidly. They should be considered in lieu of
aprons where overfalls exit at the ends of pipes or where high flows would require
excessive apron length. Consider other energy dissipators such as concrete impact
basins or paved outlet structures where site conditions warrant.
e. Design Criteria  The criteria for design of riprap outlets are:
1. Capacity: 10-year peak runoff or the design discharge of the water conveyance
structure, whichever is greater.
2. Apron Size: If the water conveyance structure discharges directly into a defined
channel, extend the apron across the channel bottom and up the channel banks
to an elevation of 0.5 feet (150 mm) above the maximum tailwater depth or to the
top of the bank, whichever is less. Determine the maximum allowable velocity for
the receiving stream, and design the riprap apron to reduce the flow to this
velocity before the flow leaves the apron. Calculate the apron length for velocity
control or use the length required to meet stable conditions downstream,
whichever is greater.
3. Grade: Ensure that the apron has zero grade. There should be no overfall at the
end of the apron; that is, the elevation of the top of the apron, at the downstream
end, should be the same as the elevation of the bottom of the receiving channel
or the adjacent ground if there is no channel.
4. Alignment: The apron should be straight throughout its entire length, but if a
curve is necessary to align the apron with the receiving stream, locate the curve
in the upstream section of riprap.
5. Materials: Ensure that riprap consists of a well-graded mixture of stone. Larger
stone should predominate, with sufficient smaller sizes to fill the voids between
the stones. The diameter of the largest stone size should be no greater than 1.5
times the d50 size.
6. Thickness: The minimum thickness of riprap shall be 1.5 times the maximum
stone diameter.
7. Filter: Install geotextile to prevent soil movement through the openings in the
riprap.
f. Construction Specifications  Filter cloth, when used, must meet design
requirements and be properly protected from punching or tearing during installation.
Repair any damaged fabric by removing the riprap and placing another piece of filter
cloth over the damaged area. All connecting joints should overlap a minimum of 1
foot.
1. Riprap may be placed by equipment, but take care to avoid damaging the filter.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-34
2. The minimum thickness of the riprap should be 1.5 times the maximum stone
diameter.
3. Construct the apron on zero grade with no overfall at the end. Make the top of
the riprap at the downstream end level with the receiving area or slightly below it.
4. Ensure that the apron is properly aligned with the receiving stream.
5. Immediately after construction, stabilize all disturbed areas with vegetation.
g. Inspection and Maintenance 
Inspect riprap outlet structures after heavy rains to see if any erosion around or
below the riprap has taken place or if stones have been dislodged. Immediately
make all needed repairs to prevent further damage.

APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-35
E.2.5 Erosion Control BMPs
Erosion control is any practice that protects the soil surfaces and prevents the soil
particles from being detached by rainfall or wind. Erosion control, therefore, is a source
control that treats the soil as a resource that has value and should be kept in place.
The most efficient and economical method of controlling sheet, rill and raindrop impact
erosion is to establish vegetative cover from seed. Vegetation can reduce erosion by
more than 90% by protecting the soil from raindrop impact and sheet erosion.
When erosion control BMPs are implemented and maintained, the amount of sediment
associated with runoff waters can be dramatically reduced. Whenever possible do
erosion control first and sediment control second. Some important points to remember:
a. Vegetative cover is the primary erosion control practice.
b. Retain existing vegetation by minimizing disturbance and scheduling large land
disturbances during periods of expected dry weather.
c. Establishing cover immediately after disturbance (staging) is important.
d. Temporary erosion control is usually achieved by seeding with fast growing annual
grasses and/or protecting the soil with mulch.
e. Permanent erosion control usually involves planting perennial grasses, shrubs, and
trees.
The selection of the right plant material for the site, choosing the correct mulching
technique and proper seedbed preparation are critical for effective erosion control.
Surface roughening, contour furrows, and stepped slopes are essential to establish
vegetation.
E.2.5.1 Costs  Non-structural erosion control practices are generally more costeffective
than sediment control. For example, the cost of temporary seeding one acre
would be comparable to the cost of installing 200 LF of silt fence (for a 1 acre drainage)
or equivalent to the cost of constructing a temporary sediment trap designed for a oneacre
drainage. However, the practice of temporary seeding would probably be more
effective while the silt fence and sediment trap will require regular and costly
maintenance.
Erosion control is, generally, more cost-effective than sediment control and requires less
maintenance and repair.
E.2.5.2 Erosion Control Blankets and Mats 
a. Definition  The installation of protective mulch blankets or soil stabilization mats
(turf reinforcement mats) to the prepared soil surface of a steep slope, channel or
shoreline.
b. Purpose  Erosion control blankets are used to temporarily stabilize and protect
disturbed soil from raindrop impact and surface erosion, to increase infiltration,
decrease compaction and soil crusting, and to conserve soil moisture. Mulching with
erosion control blankets will increase the germination rates for grasses and legumes
and promote vegetation establishment. Erosion control blankets also protect seeds
from birds, reduce desiccation and evaporation by insulating the soil and seed
environment.
c. Some types of erosion control blankets and turf reinforcement mats are specifically
designed to stabilize channelized flow areas. These blankets and mats can aide the
establishment of vegetation in waterways and increase the maximum permissible
velocity of the given channel by reinforcing the soil and vegetation to resist the forces
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-36
of erosion during runoff events. Stems, roots and rhizomes of the vegetation
become intertwined with the mat, reinforcing the vegetation and anchoring the mat.
d. Conditions Where Practice Applies  Establishing vegetation in channels or on
slopes may require additional measures beyond seeding and straw mulching.
Conditions where erosion control blankets and mats are appropriate may include:
1. Slopes and disturbed soils where mulch must be anchored and other methods
such as, crimping or tackifying are neither feasible nor adequate.
2. Steep slopes, generally steeper than 3:1.
3. Slopes where erosion hazard is high.
4. Critical slopes adjacent to sensitive areas such as streams and wetlands.
5. Disturbed soil areas where planting is likely to be slow in providing adequate
protective cover.
6. Channels with flow exceeding 2-4 ft./sec. (0.6-1 m/sec.).
7. In channels intended to be vegetated and where the design flow exceeds the
permissible velocity. Allowable velocity, with turf reinforcement mats after
vegetative establishment, is up to 10 ft/sec. (3 m/sec).
e. Specifications  Erosion control blankets are generally a machine produced mat of
organic, biodegradable mulch such as straw, curled wood fiber (excelsior), coconut
fiber or a combination thereof, evenly distributed on or between photodegradable
polypropylene or biodegradable natural fiber netting.
1. Synthetic erosion control blankets are a machine-produced mat of ultraviolet
stabilized synthetic fibers and filaments. The nettings and mulch material are
stitched to ensure integrity and the blankets are provided in rolls for ease of
handling and installation.
2. Soil stabilization and turf reinforcement mats are high strength, flexible, machine
produced, three dimensional matrix of nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene or
polyvinyl chloride that have ultra violet (UV) stabilizers added to the compounds
to ensure endurance and provide permanent vegetation stabilization.
f. Planning Considerations  Erosion control blankets and turf reinforcement matting
can be applied to problem areas to supplement natures erosion control system
(vegetation) in its initial establishment and in providing a safe and natural
conveyance for high velocity stormwater runoff. These products are being used
today in many applications where previously a structural lining or armoring would
have been required. Care must be taken to choose the type matting which is more
appropriate for the specific needs of a project.
g. Construction Specifications 
1. Site Preparation:
a. Grade and shape area of installation.
b. Remove all rocks, clods, and vegetative or other obstructions so that the
installed blankets, or mats will have direct contact with the soil.
c. Prepare seedbed by loosening 2-3 inches (50-75 mm) of topsoil above final
grade.
d. Incorporate amendments, such as lime and fertilizer, into soil according to
soil test.
2. Seeding: Seed area before blanket installation for erosion control and revegetation.
Seeding after mat installation is often specified for turf reinforcement
application. When seeding prior to blanket installation, all check slots and other
areas disturbed during installation must be reseeded. Where soil filling is
specified, seed the matting and the entire disturbed area after installation and
prior to filling the mat with soil.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-37
3. Anchoring: U-shaped wire staples, metal geotextile stake pins, or triangular
wooden stakes can be used to anchor mats to the ground surface. Wire staples
should be a minimum of 11 gauge. Metal stake pins should be 3/16 inch (4.8
mm) diameter steel with a 1 1/2 inch (38.1 mm) steel washer at the head of the
pin. Wire staples and metal stakes should be driven flush to the soil surface. All
anchors should be 6-8 inches (0.2-0.5 m) long and have sufficient ground
penetration to resist pullout. Longer anchors may be required for loose soils.
4. Installation on Slopes:
a. Begin at the top of the slope and anchor its blanket in a 6-inch (0.2 m) deep x
6-inch (0.2 m) wide trench. Backfill trench and tamp earth firmly.
b. Unroll blanket downslope in the direction of the water flow.
c. The edges of adjacent parallel rolls must be overlapped 2-3 inches (51-76
mm) and be stapled every 3 feet (0.9 m).
d. When blankets must be spliced, place blankets end over end (shingle style)
with 6-inch (0.2 m) overlap. Staple through overlapped area, approximately
12 inches (0.3 m) apart.
e. Lay blankets loosely and maintain direct contact with the soil - do not stretch.
f. Blankets shall be stapled sufficiently to anchor blanket and maintain contact
with the soil. Staples shall be placed down the center and staggered with the
staples placed along the edges. Steep slopes, 1:1 to 2:1, require 2 staples
per square yard. Moderate slopes, 2:1 to 3:1, require 1-2 staples per square
yard (1 staple 3 o.c.). Gentle slopes require 1 staple per square yard.
5. Installation in Channels:
a. Dig initial anchor trench 12 inches (0.3 m) deep and 6 inches (0.2 m) wide
across the channel at the lower end of the project area.
b. Excavate intermittent check slots, 6 inches (0.2 m) deep and 6 inches (0.2 m)
wide across the channel at 25-30 foot (7.6-9.1 m) intervals along the channel.
c. Cut longitudinal channel anchor slots 4 inches (101 mm) deep and 4 inches
(101 mm) wide along each side of the installation to bury edges of matting.
Whenever possible extend matting 2-3 inches (51-76 mm) above the crest of
channel side slopes.
d. Beginning at the downstream end and in the center of the channel, place the
initial end of the first roll in the anchor trench and secure with fastening
devices at 1-foot (0.3 m) intervals. Note: matting will initially be upside down
in anchor trench.
e. Position adjacent rolls in anchor trench, overlapping the preceding roll a min.
of 3 inches (76 mm).
f. Secure these initial ends of mats with anchors at 1-foot (300 mm) intervals.
g. Unroll center strip of matting upstream. Stop at next check slot or terminal
anchor trench.
h. Unroll adjacent mats upstream in similar fashion, maintaining a 3-inch (76
mm) overlap.
i. Fold and secure all rolls of matting snugly into all transverse check slots. Lay
mat in the bottom of the slot then fold back against itself. Anchor through
both layers of mat at 1-inch (25 mm) intervals, then backfill and compact soil.
6. Inspection and Maintenance
a. All blanket and mats should be inspected periodically following installation.
b. Inspect installation after significant rainstorms to check for erosion and
undermining.

E.2.5.3 Riprap 
a. Definition  Riprap is a layer of stone designed to protect and stabilize areas subject
to erosion.
b. Purpose  To protect the soil surface from erosive forces and/or improve stability of
soil slopes that are subject to seepage or have poor soil structure.
c. Conditions Where Practice Applies  Riprap is used for the following applications:
channel side slopes and bottoms, inlets and outlets for culverts, bridges, slope
drains, grade stabilization structures, and storm drains, streambank and stream
grades, shorelines subject to wave action.
d. Planning Considerations 
1. Riprap is a versatile, highly erosion-resistant material that can be used effectively
in many locations and in a variety of ways to control erosion on construction
sites.
2. Graded Versus Uniform Riprap: Riprap is classed as either graded or uniform.
Graded riprap includes a wide mixture of stone sizes. Uniform riprap consists of
stones nearly all the same size.
3. Graded riprap is preferred to uniform riprap in most applications because it forms
a dense, flexible cover.
4. Proper slope selection and surface preparation are essential for successful long
term functioning of riprap. Adequate compaction of fill areas and proper use of
filter blankets or aggregate foundation is necessary. A pre-constructed type of
riprap includes grid pavers, articulated concrete mats, concrete armor units, and
interlocking concrete blocks.
5. When riprap is used for outlet protection, place the riprap before, or in
conjunction with the installation of the structure so that it is in place before the
first runoff event.
e. Design Criteria 
1. Gradation: Riprap should be a well-graded mixture with 50% by weight larger
than the specified design size.
2. Size: The designer should determine the riprap size that will be stable for site
conditions. Having determined the design stone size, the designer should then
select the size or sizes that equal or exceed riprap gradation commercially
available in the area.
3. Thickness: Construction techniques, dimensions of the area to be protected, size
and gradation of the riprap, the frequency and duration of flow, difficulty and cost
of maintenance, and consequence of failure should be considered when
determining the thickness of riprap linings. The minimum thickness should be
1.5 times the maximum stone diameter., but in no case less than 6 inches (150
mm).
4. Slope Stabilization: Riprap stone for slope stabilization not subject to flowing
water or wave action should be sized for stability for the proposed grade. The
gradient of the slope to be stabilized should be less than the natural angle of
repose of the stone selected. Riprap used for surface stabilization of slopes does
not add significant resistance to sliding or slope failure and should not be
considered a retaining wall.
5. Outlet Protection: Design criteria for sizing stone and determining the dimensions
of riprap pads at channel or conduit outlets are presented in: USDA, SCS Field
Design Manual; Manual of Standards for Erosion and Sediment Control
Measures-Association of Bay Area Governments and other engineering design
manuals.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-41
6. Filter Blanket: A filter blanket is a layer of material placed between the riprap and
the underlying soil to prevent soil movement into or through the riprap. A suitable
filter may consist of a well-graded gravel or sand-gravel layer or a synthetic filter
fabric manufactured for this purpose. The design of a gravel filter blanket is
based on the ratio of particle size in the overlying filter material to that of the base
material in accordance with the criteria below. The designed gravel filter blanket
may consist of several layers of increasingly large particles from sand to erosion
control stone. Filter blankets should always be provided where seepage is
significant or where flow velocity and duration of flow or turbulence may cause
the underlying soil particles to move through the riprap.
f. Construction Specifications 
1. Before laying riprap and filler, prepare the subgrade to the required lines and
grades shown on the plans. Compact any fill required in the subgrade to a
density approximating that of the surrounding undisturbed material.
2. Overfill depressions with riprap.
3. Cut the subgrade sufficiently deep so that the finished grade of the riprap will be
at the elevation of the surrounding area. Channels should be excavated
sufficiently to allow placement of the riprap in a manner such that the finished
inside dimensions and grade of the riprap meet design specifications.
4. Place the sand and gravel filter blanket immediately after the ground foundation
is prepared. For gravel, spread filter stone in a uniform layer to the specified
depth. Where more than one layer of filter material is used, spread the layers
with minimal mixing.
5. Place the filter fabric directly on the prepared foundation. Overlap the edges by
at least 12 inches (300 mm), and space anchor pins every 3 feet (1 m) along the
overlap. Bury the upper and lower ends of the cloth a minimum of 12 inches
(300 mm) below ground. Take care not to damage the cloth when placing riprap.
6. Placement of riprap should follow immediately after placement of the filter. Place
riprap so that it forms a dense, well-graded mass of stone with a minimum of
voids. Place riprap to its full thickness in one operation.
7. Do not place riprap by dumping through chutes or other methods that cause
segregation of stone sizes.
8. Take care not to dislodge the underlying base or filter when placing the stones.
9. The toe of the riprap slope should be keyed to a stable foundation at its base.
10. The toe should be excavated to the depth about 1.5 times the design thickness of
the riprap and should extend horizontally from the slope.
11. The finished slope should be free of pockets of small stone or clusters of large
stones. Hand placing may be necessary to achieve the proper distribution of
stone sizes to produce a relatively smooth, uniform surface. The finished grade
of riprap should be apparent.
g. Inspection and Maintenance  Properly designed and installed riprap requires very
little maintenance. Riprap should be inspected periodically for scour or dislodged
stones. Control of weed and brush growth may be needed in some locations.

FIGURE E-16 TYPICAL RIPRAP PROTECTION DETAIL
E.2.5.4 Check Dams 
a. Definition  Small dams constructed across a swale or drainage ditch generally
composed of riprap. A sump prior to the dam provides sediment retention.
b. Purpose  To reduce the velocity of concentrated flows, reducing erosion of the
swale or ditch, and to slow water velocity to allow retention of sediments.
c. Construction Specifications 
1. Check dams can be constructed of rock or pea-gravel filled bags. Provide a deep
sump immediately upstream.
2. The maximum spacing between the dams shall be such that the toe of the
upstream dam is at the same elevation as the top of the downstream dam.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-43
3. Rock check dams shall be constructed of appropriately sized rock. Ensure that
the center of the dam is lower than the edges. The rock used must be large
enough to stay in place given the expected design flow through the channel.
d. Inspection and Maintenance  Check dams shall be monitored for performance
and sediment accumulation during and after each runoff producing rainfall. Sediment
shall be removed when it reaches one half the sump depth. All temporary erosion
and sediment control measures shall be removed after final site stabilization is
achieved or after the temporary BMPs are no longer needed. Trapped sediment shall
be removed or stabilized on site. Disturbed soil areas resulting from removal shall be
permanently stabilized.
E.2.5.5 Cellular Confinement Systems 
a. Definition  A three-dimensional, honeycomb earth-retaining structure used to
mechanically stabilize the surface of earth and fill slopes.
b. Purpose  Cellular Confinement System (CCS) is a permanent erosion control
practice intended to stabilize infill materials for slope and channel protection, load
support, and earth retention applications. The expandable panels create a cellular
system that confines topsoil infill, protects and reinforces the plants root zone, and
permits natural subsurface drainage. The honeycomb shaped cells encapsulate and
prevent erosion of the infill material. The cellular confinement systems are used for:
1. Revetments - filling the cells with topsoil or rock can provide an alternative to
hard armor revetment systems.
2. Erosion control on steep slopes - cells can be infilled with soil and vegetated.
Slopes as steep as 1:1 can be treated with cellular confinement systems.
Application on steep slopes may require tendons for system stability and security
against sliding.
3. Flexible channel lining systems, either vegetated or rock filled.
4. Road stabilization - cells confine and reinforce select fill materials, thereby
increasing load-bearing capacities. Creates a porous pavement system with
aggregate or topsoil/vegetation infill.
c. Construction Specifications 
1. Site Preparation: The surface of the slope should be leveled, with stones and
debris removed. Following excavation and fill placement operations, shape and
compact the subgrade surfaces to the designed elevations and grades. Excavate
the area so that when cellular confinement systems are installed, the top of the
section is flush with or slightly lower than the adjacent terrain or final grade.
Remove unstable subgrade soils when required and install geotextile underlayer
if specified.
2. Installation: Anchor the cellular confinement system sections at the top of the
slope across a 2-4 foot (0.6-1 m) ledge. Expand and stretch the cellular
confinement system down the slopes. Typically, every other cell across the top
section is anchored with J-pins or other suitable anchor devices. This anchoring
pattern is repeated every 6 feet (2 m) down the slope. The cells should be
anchored securely in order to prevent deformation of the panel while backfilling.
Depending on the slope angle and fill soils involved, intermediate anchorage will
be necessary on some interior cells in order to limit sideways deformation, insure
stability and avoid overloading the upper sections. Additional panels are abutted
together and joined with staples, hog rings or other suitable fasteners.
3. Infill Placement: Place the fill material in the expanded cells with suitable
equipment such as a back-hoe, front-end loader or conveyer. Limit drop height
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-44
to 3 feet (1 m). On steep slopes, infill from the crest to the toe to prevent
displacement and deformation of the cellular confinement system.
d. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Inspect slope periodically and after significant rainstorms to check for erosion.
2. If vegetation has not been established, fertilize and reseed damaged and sparse
areas immediately.
FIGURE E-17 CELLULAR CONFINEMENT SYSTEMS
E.2.6 Sediment Control BMPs
Sedimentation is the deposition of soil particles that have been transported by water or
wind. The amount of sediment produced during construction is directly proportional to
the degree and effectiveness of erosion control practices implemented. The quantity and
size of the particles transported increases with the velocity of the runoff.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-45
Sediment control is used to keep sediment, the product of erosion, on-site. Sediment
control involves the construction of structures that allow sediment to settle out of
suspension. Sediment control structures, therefore, require frequent inspection and
maintenance.
Generally, sediment is retained on-site by two methods:
a. Slowing runoff velocities, as they flow through an area, sufficiently so that sediment
cannot be transported; and
b. Impounding sediment-laden runoff for a period of time so that the soil particles settle
out.
Sediment controls are not filters. Practices referred to as "sediment filtering" actually
work by slowing velocities and allowing sediment impoundment to de-water in a very
slow and controlled manner. For effective sediment control planning and design,
materials such as geotextiles, silt fences, and straw bales should be considered for their
ability to impound water and slow runoff velocities, not for their ability to "filter" sediment.
Effective sediment control involves ponding sediment-laden runoff long enough for the
soil particles to settle out of suspension. Reducing runoff velocities will also reduce
sediment transport and thereby help retain sediment on-site.
Structural sediment control can be divided into three general types:
a. Sediment basins;
b. Sediment traps; and
c. Sediment barriers.
E.2.6.1 Temporary Sediment Traps, Excavated Sediment Traps, &
Excavated Storm Drain Inlets 
a. Definition  Temporary traps designed to trap sediment from small contributing
areas during construction. These traps typically require less design work and are
inexpensive to construct.
b. Design Criteria  Temporary Sediment Traps are recommended for disturbed
drainage areas less than 5 ac (2 ha). A typical Sediment Trap designed to handle 0.5
inches (12.7 mm) of runoff over a 24 hour period would require a settling zone
capacity of 67 yd3 / ac (130 m3 / ha) of contributing drainage area and a sediment
storage capacity of 33 yd3 / ac (65 m3 / ha) of drainage area.
Excavated Sediment Traps require less rigorous design work, are smaller in size and
they are easier to construct; therefore, a preferable alternative is to sub-divide large
projects into smaller subareas (less than 5 ac) and utilize numerous sediment traps.
Multiple traps and / or additional volume may be required to accommodate site
specific rainfall and soil conditions. This approach may facilitate phased construction
along relatively narrow highway ROW.
Excavated Storm Drain Inlets are small excavated sediment traps located at storm
drain inlets are effective as part of phased construction. The design capacity of
excavated inlet sediment traps shall be 67 yd3 / acre (1800 ft3 / ac) of contributing
drainage area. These excavations are temporary and they are not very effective for
trapping small particles (silt and clay) and they should not be used where runoff
velocities are high.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-46
c. Construction Specifications 
1. Sediment traps should have a controlled overflow such as a riprap outlet.
2. Typically a sediment barrier such as silt fencing should be located below the
outlet.
3. A temporary diversion berm should direct flow into the trap.
d. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Inspect after each rain.
2. Likely, sediment will need to be removed after each rain.
3. Ensure that the outlet is stable.
FIGURE E-18 SEDIMENT TRAPS
E.2.6.2 Temporary Sediment Basin 
a. Definition  A temporary sediment basin is a pond created by excavation in
construction of an embankment and designed to retain or detain runoff sufficiently to
allow excess sediment to settle.
b. Purpose  The temporary sediment basin is intended to collect and store sediment
from sites that are cleared and/or graded during construction or for extended periods
of time before permanent vegetation is re-established or before permanent drainage
structures are completed. It is intended to trap sediment before it leaves the
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-47
construction site. The basin is temporary, with a design life of 12 to 18 months, and
is to be maintained until the site area is permanently stabilized.
c. Design Considerations 
1. Sediment basins can trap 70-80 percent of the sediment which flows into them if
designed and constructed appropriately. This design requires a runoff detention
time of 24-40 hours. The sediment basin designed according to the criteria in
this manual is only practically effective in removing sediment down to the
medium silt size. Sediment-laden runoff with smaller size fractions, fine silts and
clay, will likely pass untreated through the basin. Sediment ponds may be
capable of trapping smaller soil particles if additional detention time is provided.
Chemical flocculants such as polyacrylamide may also be effective. There are
inherent problems associated with constructing basins large enough to pond all
the sediment-laden runoff long enough to allow all of the fine soil particles to
settle out. Therefore, sediment basins must be used in conjunction with other
erosion control practices in order to increase effectiveness and trap efficiently.
2. Sediment basins should be located where failure of the embankment would not
cause loss of life or property damage. A good location is where a post
construction detention basin is proposed.
d. Design Criteria 
1. Design the basin to capture runoff from a 2-year, 24-hour storm.
2. A detention time of 24-40 hours is required to allow 70-80 percent of the
sediment to settle.
3. Use a subsurface drain and/or a solid riser pipe with sufficient dewatering holes
to provide sufficient detention time. A perforated riser with a filter fabric and/or
gravel jacket may provide sufficient detention time for basins draining up to 10
acres (4.05 ha). Determine the sediment basin volume. The sediment basin
volume consists of two zones:
a. A sediment storage zone at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in depth.
b. A settling zone at least 2 feet (0.6 m) in depth.
1. The settling zone volume is determined by the following equation:
a. V = 1.2(SD)Q/VSED
b. Q = design inflow based on the peak discharge from a specified
design storm (e.g., a 2-year, 24-hour duration design storm event)
from the tributary drainage area as computed using the methods
required by the local flood control agency. Provide a minimum 67 yd3
(51.2 m3) of settling volume per acre (0.4 ha)of drainage if a design
storm is not specified.
c. V/SED = the settling velocity of the design soil particle. The design soil
particle chosen is medium silt (0.02 mm). This has a settling velocity
(V/SED) of 0.00096 ft./sec. (.024 mm/sec.) As a general rule it will not
be necessary to design for a particle of size less than 0.02 mm,
especially since the surface area requirement increases dramatically
for smaller particle sizes. For example, a design particle of 0.01 mm
requires about three times the surface area of 0.02 mm. Note also
that choosing VSED of 0.00096 ft./sec (.024 mm/sec.) equates to a
surface area (SA) of 1250 ft2 (116.1 m2) per cfs of inflow.
d. SD = settling depth, which should be at least 2 feet (0.6 m), and no
shallower than the average distance from the inlet to the outlet of the
pond (L) divided by 200 (i.e.,SD>L/200).
4. The total sediment basin volume and dimensions are determined as outlined
below:
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-48
a. Determine the basin geometry for the sediment storage volume calculated
above using a minimum of 1 foot (0.3 m). depth and 3:1 side slopes from the
bottom of the basin. Note: the basin bottom is level.
b. Extend the basin side slopes (at 3:1 max.) as necessary to obtain the settling
zone volume as determined above.
c. Adjust the geometry of the basin to effectively combine the settling zone
volume and sediment storage volumes while preserving the depth and side
slope criteria.
d. Provide an emergency spillway with a crest elevation one foot above the tip
of the riser pipe.
e. The ratio between the basin length and width of the pond should either be
greater than 6:1, or baffles should be installed to prevent short-circuiting.
f. The length to settling depth ratio (L/SD) should be less than 200.
e. Construction Specifications 
1. Construct the basin by excavating or building an embankment before any
clearing or grading work begins.
2. A cut-off trench shall be excavated along the centerline of the earth fill
embankments. The minimum depth shall be 2 feet (0.6 m). The cut-off trench
shall extend up both abutments to the riser crest elevation.
3. Fill material for the embankment should be clean mineral soil free of roots, woody
vegetation, oversized stones, rocks or other objectionable material.
4. Fill material shall be placed in 6 inch (0.2 m) lifts, continuous layers over the
entire length of the fill. Compacting shall be obtained by routing the hauling
equipment over the fill so that the entire surface of each layer of the fill is
traversed by at least one wheel or tread track of the equipment, or by the use of
a compactor.
5. The embankment should be constructed to an elevation of 10 percent higher
than the design height to allow for settlement if compacting is achieved with
hauling equipment. If compactors are used for compacting, the overbuild may be
reduced to not less than 5 percent.
6. The emergency spillway shall not be installed in fill. Elevations, design width,
and entrance and exit channel slopes are critical to the successful operation of
the emergency spillway.
f. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Inspect weekly and after each rain.
2. All damages caused by soil erosion or construction equipment shall be repaired
before the end of each working day.
3. Remove sediment when the sediment storage zone is half full. This sediment
shall be placed in such a manner that it will not erode from the site. The
sediment shall not be deposited downstream from the embankment or in or
adjacent to a stream or floodplain.
4. When temporary structures have served their intended purpose and the
contributing drainage area has been properly stabilized, the embankment and
resulting sediment deposit shall be leveled or otherwise disposed of in
accordance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan.
g. Skimmer Outlet  The skimmer maximizes the use of the volume and surface area
of the basin by regulating the flow of water out of the basin, such that it maintains a
pool of water that promotes sedimentation. The skimmer does not increase
sediment-trapping efficiency in a way that allows the size of the basin to be reduced.
The only way for a basin to be effective is for the basin to fill quickly, because the
sediment can fall out of suspension only when the pond is full of water. Conventional
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-49
basins with perforated risers or stone outlets frequently do not fill because the outlet
structures do not adequately regulate the outflow. The skimmer drains the basin
slowly over several days, and at a constant rate to maximize sedimentation. Instead
of draining the basin from the bottom, and releasing the runoff containing the most
sediment, the skimmer releases the least polluted water from near the surface.

E.2.6.3 Brush Barrier 
a. Definition  A brush barrier is generally constructed of the vegetative material
cleared from the site and often pushed to the permitted clearing limits into a windrow.
The brush barrier may be faced with wire with silt fence attached.
b. Purpose  A brush barrier is a sediment control practice that is extremely effective
due to the inherent strength of the windrowed material (often containing heavy logs
and stumps). As with other sediment controls, proper placing is important to success.
c. Design Considerations 
1. Brush Barriers are often 3-7 feet in height.
2. They should be installed on the contour.
3. As an improvement, wire may be attached to the face if the barrier with filter
fabric keyed into the soil and fastened to the wire. With large heavy barriers an
additional section of filter fabric may be installed above the first. This creates the
effect of a sediment trap. While silt fence should be cleaned after the
accumulation of 9 of sediment, a well constructed brush barrier could hold 1-2
feet of sediment accumulation. This accumulation should be removed before at
project completion.
4. Upon removal of the wire, fabric, and accumulated sediment, the barrier may be
left in place to decompose.
d. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Periodic inspections to identify excess sedimentation and torn fabric are
important. New fabric may easily be installed over the damaged portions.
E.2.6.4 Silt Fence 
a. Definition  A silt fence is a temporary sediment barrier consisting of filter fabric
entrenched into the soil and attached to supporting posts. Silt fence installed with a
trencher or by slicing is the most effective installation method to ensure against
common silt fence failures.
b. Purpose  Silt fence is a sediment control practice. Silt fence is intended to be
installed where sediment-laden water can pond, thus allowing the sediment to fall out
of suspension and separate from the runoff. It is not intended to be an erosion
control practice. Improperly applied or installed silt fence will increase erosion.
Reasons for the high failure rate of improperly
designed and installed silt fence include:
1. Improper placement on the site;
2. Allowing excessive drainage area to the silt
fence structure;
3. Shallow trenches with little or no soil
compaction;
4. Inadequate attachment to posts;
5. Failure to maintain the silt fence after
installation; and
6. Installing silt fence along property boundaries
producing "concentrated" runoff.
Silt fence is successful where:
1. non-concentrated sheet flow will occur;
2. protection of adjacent property or "waters of the United States is required;
FIGURE E-22
SILT FENCE FAILURE
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-53
3. the size of the drainage area is no more than
1/4 acre per 100 linear feet of silt fence;
4. the maximum flow path length above the
barrier is 100 feet (30.5 m);
5. the maximum slope gradient above the
barrier is 2:1;
6. small swales are carrying silt where the slope
is less than 2%; and
7. no practice other than a silt fence is feasible.
Silt Fence should not be used:
1. across slopes, even on contour;
2. around the perimeter of the construction site, unless J-hooks and/or 'smiles' are
used. Long continuous runs of silt fence will divert and concentrate sediment
laden runoff and almost certainly result in failure;
3. J-hooks or 'smiles' are preferable to linear installations. A good "rule of thumb" is
to drain no more than 1/3 acre of disturbed area into each discrete J-hook or
'smile' segment; and
4. Silt fence must only be installed where water can pond. When placed off
contour, silt fence will effectively divert runoff if that is desired.
c. Design Considerations  Typical silt fence specifications were written 25 years ago
and have changed little since. Some states have recognized some of the inherent
problems, such as inadequate trench depth, and implemented minor changes to
improve efficacy. Time and experience has shown that the outdated construction
specifications, combined with the improper application and incorrect installation of silt
fences, has resulted in it being one of the most ineffective storm water pollution
controls in use except for possibly hay bales.
During the most erosive storm events the silt particles, carried by the sediment-laden
runoff, actually plug up the fabrics pore openings. That is how the fabric prevents
the discharge of silt. However, the fabric, if properly installed and anchored, will then
pond water and sediment can begin to fall out of suspension. The silt fence will have
tremendous pressure exerted upon it. Failure will occur if too much water runoff is
directed to the fence, if the stakes are not of sufficient strength to support the
tremendous forces or, most importantly, the fence is not keyed deeply into a trench
(or sliced) and compacted such that runoff cannot go
under or around the fence.
Some general design considerations include:
1. determine what kind of runoff, and how much, is
coming onto the site; too much volume of water per
silt fence area means failure will happen;
2. determine where and how the total volume is going
to exit; total drainage area is the prime consideration
of silt fence quantity, not necessarily slope;
3. soil type can play a role in the placement and
quantity requirements; sandy soils might require
more silt fence per area to contain the volume of
potential sediment; clay soils might need fewer
FIGURE E-23

fences because the volume of potential sediment loss is less, although the
volume of water might be greater because clay soils allow less rainfall infiltration;
4. type, size and spacing of fence posts; wood posts are inadequate and should
not be used except on flat lots; steel t-posts weighing at least 1.25 lbs per ft. are
preferred, as they can be driven 24 inches into compacted soil, which is
necessary to hold a horizontal load 18 inches high, and they can also be recycled
and used repetitively; improper spacing of posts causes failures;

FIGURE E-25 SILT TRAP
The life of silt fence may be increased by installation of a silt trap.
d. Construction Specifications 
1. Silt fences have a useful life of one season. Their principal mode of action is to
slow and pond the water and allow soil particles to settle. Silt fences are not
designed to withstand high heads of water, and therefore should be located
where only shallow pools can form. Their use is limited to situations in which
sheet or overland flows are expected.
2. Install silt fence material into a trench, 4 wide and at least 6 deep, with vertical
sides. A preferred installation technique involves static slicing with an implement
such as the "Tommy Silt Fence Machine" or equivalent. The trench must be
backfilled and compacted.
3. Install silt fences with 'smiles' or J-hooks to reduce the drainage area that any
segment will impound.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-55
4. Silt fences placed at the toe of a slope shall be set at least 6 feet (1.8 m) from the
toe in order to increase ponding volume.
5. The soil should be sliced and the fabric mechanically installed into the soil.
6. The height of a silt fence shall not exceed 36 inches (0.9 m). Storage height and
ponding height shall never exceed 18 inches (0.5 m).
7. The ends of the fence should be turned uphill.
8. Steel support posts should be utilized, properly spaced and driven into
compacted soil. Place the posts on the downstream side of the fabric.
9. Post spacing shall not exceed 6 feet (1.8 m).
10. The filter fabric is wire-tied directly to the posts with three diagonal ties.
The slicing method has the capability to turn in a short distance, thus properly
installing silt fence where needed. Turning enables upturns on the ends of silt fence
runs, maneuvering around obstacles on construction sites, protection along property
lines, and following the existing site contours.
e. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Inspect fence for proper installation and compaction by pulling up on the fence
while kicking the toe of the fabric. If the fence comes out of the ground, do not
accept the installation.
2. If there are long, linear runs of silt fence, J-hooks or smiles should be installed.
3. Sediment shall be cleaned from behind the fence when it reaches 50% of the
designed impoundment height (9 inch (0.2 m).
4. Silt fences and filter barriers shall be inspected weekly after each significant
storm (1 inch in 24 hours). Any required repairs shall be made immediately.
5. Silt fences shall be removed when they have served their useful purpose, but not
before the upslope area has been permanently stabilized and any sediment
stored behind the silt fence has been removed.

E.2.6.5 Drop Inlet Sediment Barriers 
a. Definition  A drop inlet sediment barrier is a temporary barrier placed around a
drop inlet. The sediment barrier may be constructed of straw bales and gravel, gravel
and stone, block and gravel, or silt fence material. Note: Straw bale and silt fence
drop inlet sediment barriers both have very high failure rates. Monitoring of these
BMPs reveals that these practices rarely prevent sediment discharge into the storm
drains.
b. Purpose  Drop Inlet sediment barriers are intended to prevent sediment from
entering the storm drains during construction operations. This practice allows early
use of the storm drain system and is applicable for the phased construction schedule
of a wet weather plan. Sediment-laden runoff is ponded before entering the storm
drain, thus allowing some sediment to fall out of suspension.
c. Silt Fence Sediment Barrier 
1. Support posts for a silt fence must be steel fence posts or 2 by 4 inch (51 by 102
mm) wood, length 3 foot (0.9 m) minimum, spacing 3 foot (0.9 m) maximum, with
a top frame support required.
2. Excavate a trench 4 inches (101 mm) wide and 6 inches (152 mm) deep and
bury the bottom of the silt fence in the trench.
3. Backfill the trench with gravel or soil.
4. Compact the backfill well.
5. The height of the silt fence shall be a 1.5 foot (0.5 m) maximum, measured from
the top of the inlet.
FIGURE E-30 IMPROPERLY INSTALLED AND UNMAINTAINED
SILT FENCE DROP INLET BARRIER
d. Gravel Doughnut 
1. Keep the stone slope toward the inlet at 3:1 or flatter or use concrete blocks to
help prevent the stone from being washed into the drop inlet. A minimum 1 foot
(0.3 m) wide level area set 4 inches (101 mm) below the drop inlet crest will add
further protection against the entrance of material.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-61
FIGURE E-31
DRAINGUARD AND GRATEGUARD
2. Stone on the slope toward the inlet should be 3 inches (76.2 mm) or larger for
stability, and 1 inch (25.4 cm) or smaller on the slope away from the inlet to
control flow rate.
3. Wire mesh with 2 inch (51 mm) openings may be placed over the drain grating,
but must be inspected frequently to avoid blockage by trash. If concrete blocks
are used the openings should be covered with wire screen or filter fabric.
e. Silt Saver  The Silt Saver is an inlet filter constructed of a reusable rigid plastic
frame that fits over the inlet during construction. The frame is covered by filter
material that is curved upwards at the bottom so that soil may Be used to hold the
material in close contact with the ground. Independent testing of the silt saver has
shown the product to be extremely
successful at preventing sediment
entry into the inlet. This product
works best when a depressed trap
is excavated around the inlet to
induce ponding. This allows finer
sediments time to fall out of
suspension.
f. Drainguard and Grateguard 
These inlet filters have an excellent
application for grate inlets in
subdivisions after paving and during
home construction. The Drainguard is
available in a reusable model. The
Drainguard has bypass holes for
heavy flow situations. Both products
are available in a sediment only and
an oil and sediment model. Benefits
include low to moderate cost and ease
of installation and removal.

g. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Inspect the barrier after each rain and promptly make repairs as needed.
2. Sediment shall be removed after each significant storm (1 inch (25.4 mm) in 24
hours) to provide adequate storage volume for the next rain.
3. The removed sediment shall be deposited in an area that will not contribute
sediment off-site and can be permanently stabilized.
4. For gravel filters: If the gravel becomes clogged with sediment it must be
carefully removed from the inlet and either cleaned or replaced.

E.2.6.6 Curb Inlet Sediment Barriers 
a. Definition  Curb inlet sediment barriers are temporary barriers constructed from
concrete block and gravel or gravel filled sandbags.
b. Purpose  Curb inlet sediment barriers are intended to reduce the sediment
discharged into storm drains by ponding the runoff and allowing the sediment to
settle out. The structures allow for overflow from high runoff events and the gravel
allows the ponds to dewater rapidly.
c. Design Considerations  The sandbag curb inlet and block and gravel sediment
barrier can be used at curb inlets on gently sloping, paved streets where:
1. water can pond and allow sediment to separate out of suspension;
2. runoff is relatively low, less than 0.5 ft3/sec (.01 m3/sec).
3. Once the small catchment areas behind the sandbags or block and gravel fill with
sediment, future sediment-laden runoff will enter the storm drain without being
desilted. Therefore, sediment must be removed from these structures during or
after each storm. Additional storage can be obtained by constructing a series of
sandbag barriers along the gutter so that each barrier traps small amounts of
sediment.
d. Construction Specifications 
1. Place the barriers on gently sloping streets where water can pond.
2. The barriers must allow for overflow from a severe storm event. Slope runoff
shall be allowed to flow over blocks and gravel and not be bypassed over the
curb. The sandbag should be of woven-type geotextile fabric since burlap bags
deteriorate rapidly. The sandbags shall be filled with 3/4 inch (19 mm) drain rock
or 1/4 inch (6 mm) pea gravel.
3. The sandbags shall be placed in a curved row from the top of curb at least 3 feet
(0.9 m) into the street. The row should be curved at the ends, pointing uphill.
4. Several layers of bags should be overlapped and packed tightly.
5. Leave a one-sandbag gap in the top row to act as a spillway.
For Block and Gravel Type Barriers:
1. Place two concrete blocks on their sides perpendicular to the curb at either end
of the inlet opening. These are the spacer blocks.
2. Place concrete blocks on their sides across the front of the inlet and abutting the
spacer blocks. The openings in the blocks should face outward, not upward.
3. Cut a 2 by 4 inch (51 by 102 mm) stud the length of the curb inlet plus the width
of the two spacer blocks. Place the stud through the outer hole of each spacer
block to help keep the front blocks in place.
4. Place wire mesh over the outside vertical face (open ends) of the blocks to
prevent stone from being washed through the blocks.
5. Use chicken wire, hardware cloth with 1/2 inch (13 mm) openings, or filter fabric.
6. Place 3/4 -1 1/3 inch (19-34 mm) gravel against the wire to the top of the barrier.

e. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Inspect and clean barrier during and after each significant storm and remove
sediment from behind sandbag structure after every storm.
2. Any sediment and gravel shall be immediately removed from the traveled way of
roads.
3. The removed sediment shall be placed where it cannot enter a storm drain,
stream, or be transported off site.

E.2.7 Bank Stabilization/Bioengineering
E.2.7.1 Structural Streambank Stabilization 
a. Definition  Streambank stabilization may take many forms including gabions and
riprap. Gabions are rectangular wire baskets filled with stones used as pervious,
semi-flexible building blocks. Live rooting branches may be placed between the
rock-filled baskets.
b. Purpose  To protect streambanks from the erosive forces of moving water. Rockfilled
gabions can be used to armor the bed and/or banks of channels or used to
divert flow away from eroding channel sections.
c. Conditions Where Practice Applies  Rock-filled or vegetated rock gabions are
applicable to streambank sections, which are subject to excessive erosion due to
increased flows or disturbance during construction. This practice is applicable where
flow velocities exceed 6 ft/sec. (2 m/sec.) and where vegetative streambank
protection alone is not sufficient. Gabions can be used to construct deflectors or
groins intended to divert flow away from eroding streambank sections. Gabions are
also used to construct retaining walls and grade control structures.
Gabions and gabion mattresses (which essentially are rock blankets consisting of a
layer of rock encased by wire) are often preferable to rock riprap alone. For any
given hydraulic condition, the gabion or gabion mattress revetment thickness is one
third (1/3) of an equivalent riprap design. Gabions and gabion mattresses are flexible
and free draining thus allowing some soil settling. They can be used in unstable
streambeds and streambanks. Gabions can provide an important component to a
bioengineering solution for streambank or slope erosion because they allow the
growth and establishment of natural vegetation.
d. Site Considerations  All of the general streambank stabilization considerations are
to be followed. The following are specific considerations for gabion structures.
Gabion walls are appropriate where:
1. The vertical integrity of a soil bank needs a higher tensile strength to reduce
sloughing of the streambank.
2. There is moderate to excessive sub-surface water movements that may be
creating erosion and damage other types of non permeable structures.
3. An excessively steep stream bank must be stabilized and vegetative or extreme
mechanical means of stabilization (i.e., pulling back bank) are not feasible due to
site conditions.
4. Where slope must be modified while heavy machinery is unavailable to the site.
5. Fill must be disposed of along an eroding streambank (fill can be placed behind
gabion to modify slope).
6. A retaining or toe wall is needed to stabilize the slope.
e. Types of Gabion Structures:
1. Gabion Wall: Basically a gravity wall which relies on its own weight and frictional
resistance to resist sliding and overturning from lateral earth pressure.
2. Vegetated Rock Gabion: A rock-filled gabion earth-retaining structure which has
live branches placed between each consecutive layer of rock-filled baskets. The
live branches will take root inside the gabion and into the soil behind the
structure. The vegetation will consolidate the structures and bind it to the slope.
3. Gabion Deflector: Deflector or groins project into the streams and divert flows
away from eroding streambank sections.
APPENDIX E  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
North Augusta Development Code E-69
4. Gabion Aprons: Rock filled gabions or gabions mattress used as outlet
protection, energy dissipators or spillways. These semi-flexible gabions are
designed to settle without fracture and adhere to the ground if scour occurs.
5. Grade Control: Drop structures or weirs. Gabion baskets and mattresses can be
combined to construct check dams or weirs.
6. Channel Lining: Gabion mattresses can be used to line channels. The lining
thickness depends on many factors such as the type of rock, design flow velocity,
sediment and bedload, and channel gradient.
f. Vegetated Riprap  Vegetated riprap should be used where channel velocity does
not require the use of gabions. This practice is excellent when stabilization is
needed, but a more natural and aesthetically pleasing embankment is called for.
The vegetation will provide stream shading for temperature control as well as wildlife
habitat and a contribution of organic matter to the stream ecosystem.
g. Construction Specifications 
1. Gabions shall be fabricated in such a manner that the sides, ends, lid and
diaphragms can be assembled at the construction site into rectangular baskets of
the sizes specified and shown on the construction drawings.
2. Gabions shall be of single-unit construction; the base, lid, ends and sides shall
be either woven into a single unit or one edge of these members connected to
the base section of the gabion in such a manner that the strength and flexibility at
the connecting point is at least equal to that of the mesh.
3. Where the length of the gabion exceeds 1.5 times its horizontal width, the gabion
shall be divided by diaphragms of the same mesh and gauge as the body of the
gabion, into cells whose length does not exceed the horizontal width.
4. The stone size to fill gabion shall be 3-5 inches (76-127 mm) for gabion
mattresses and 4-8 inches (101-203 mm) for gabion.
h. Inspection and Maintenance 
1. Structural damage caused by storm events should be repaired as soon as
possible to prevent further damage to the structure or erosion of the streambank.

F.1 GENERALLY
F.1.1 Scope
This appendix provides guidance for the continuing maintenance of stormwater runoff
quality in the implementation of the requirements of Article 17 of this Chapter and in the
utilization of low impact development techniques for stormwater management as
required by various provisions of this Chapter and in conjunction with the design and
development of conservation subdivisions provided for in Article 2 of this Chapter.
F.1.2 Modifications
The City Engineer may add to or modify the contents of this appendix when appropriate
and for valid reasons to clarify or update best management practices associated with
stormwater quality management. Such modifications shall be documented and
forwarded to the Planning Commission as information. In specific cases and for
documented reasons, the City Engineer may waive the submission of documents or
specific activities required herein. The reasons for any such waiver shall be recorded in
the project application file.
F.2 STORMWATER QUALITY
F.2.1 Introduction
Designing stormwater management practices (STPs) with water quality considerations is
not a new practice, but over time the science of water quality treatment has advanced
and local regulations have tightened. Water quality has typically been addressed through
extended detention using a dry detention pond. Research has demonstrated that this
method is not effective nor is it comparable to other types of treatments.
The North Augusta Stormwater Management Department (SMD) requires treatment of
the runoff from the first one-inch of rainfall from a project site. The following equation
may be used to determine the Water Quality Volume (WQv):
WQv = (1in)(Rv)(A)/12
Where A = Site Area (acres)
Where Rv = 0.05 + 0.009I
Where I = Site Impervious Cover (%)
This equation uses the runoff coefficient (RV), described in the Simple Method. Other
simple regressions or methods could be used as a substitute to calculate the runoff
volume. Regressions based on local data are preferred.
F.2.1.1 Tools of Analysis  For quantity-based water quality sizing criteria,
several simple regressions can be used to calculate the runoff volume. A few
methodologies for methods that calculate on-site loads include:
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-3
a. The Simple Method is a way of calculating runoff and pollutant loads based on
impervious cover, rainfall and event mean concentration (EMC) data for different
water quality parameters. This model has been expanded to incorporate subsurface
flows as well in the Simplified Urban Nutrient Output Model (SUNOM).
b. SWIMM is a model developed by the EPA for analyzing stormwater quantity and
quality associated with runoff from urban areas. Both single-event and continuous
simulation can be performed on catchments having storm sewers, or combined
sewers and natural drainage, for prediction of flows, stages and pollutant
concentrations.
c. SLAMM This model is based on small storm hydrology and pollutant runoff from
urban land uses. Pollutant sources are identified and both structural and
nonstructural stormwater practices can be accounted for in the model.
Pollutant removal effectiveness of the practices found in this manual will obviously vary
widely based on site conditions and practice design. There are many programs available
to determine pollutant removal rates for all practices covered here. In addition, vendors
of proprietary treatment practices size their product based on specific site conditions. A
general overview of pollutant removal rates for some of the more common STPs is
presented in Table F-1.

F.2.2 Stormwater Ponds
Stormwater ponds are practices that have a combination of a permanent pool, extended
detention or shallow marsh equivalent to the entire WQv. Design variants include:
a. Micropool Extended Detention Pond (Figure F-1)
b. Wet Pond (Figure F-2)
c. Wet Extended Detention Pond (Figure F-3)
d. Multiple Pond System (Figure F-4)
e. Pocket" Pond (Figure F-5)
Dry extended detention ponds that have no permanent pool are not considered an
acceptable option for meeting WQv due to poor pollutant removal and chronic
maintenance problems.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-4
The term "pocket" refers to a pond or wetland that has such a small contributing
drainage area that little or no baseflow is available to sustain water elevations during dry
weather. Instead, water elevations are heavily influenced and, in some cases,
maintained by a locally high water table.
Stormwater ponds can also be used to provide Channel Protection volume as well as
overbank and extreme flood attenuation.

FIGURE F-5 POCKET POND
F.2.2.1 Pond Feasibility  Stormwater ponds should have a minimum
contributing drainage area of ten acres or more unless groundwater is confirmed as the
primary water source (i.e., pocket pond). This drainage area requirement ensures that
the permanent pond can be maintained by the runoff from the contributing drainage. A
water balance analysis may replace this requirement. In addition, the specific drainage
area requirements will vary based on regional rainfall and temperature.
Stormwater ponds should not be located within jurisdictional waters, including wetlands.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-10
F.2.2.2 Pond Conveyance  Conveyance should be provided which does not
cause erosion. When reinforced concrete pipe is used for the principal spillway to
increase its longevity, "O-ring" gaskets (ASTM C361) should be used to create
watertight joints.
F.2.2.3 Inlet Protection  A forebay should be provided at each inlet, unless the
inlet provides less than 10% of the total design storm inflow to the pond. Inlet areas
should be protected to reduce erosion. Inlet pipes to the pond can be partially
submerged.
A sediment forebay is important for maintenance and longevity of a stormwater
treatment pond. Each pond should have a sediment forebay or equivalent upstream
pretreatment. The forebay should consist of a separate cell, formed by an acceptable
barrier. The forebay shall be sized to contain 0.1 inches per impervious acre of
contributing drainage, and should be 4 to 6 feet deep. The forebay storage volume can
count toward the total WQv requirement. Exit velocities from the forebay should be nonerosive.
Direct maintenance access for appropriate equipment should be provided to the
forebay. A fixed vertical sediment depth marker should be installed in the forebay to
measure sediment deposition over time. The bottom of the forebay may be hardened to
make sediment removal easier.
F.2.2.4 Adequate Outfall Protection  Outfalls should be constructed such that
they do not increase erosion or have undue influence on the downstream
geomorphology of the stream. Flared pipe sections that discharge at or near the stream
invert or into a step-pool arrangement should be used at the spillway outlet. The channel
immediately below the pond outfall shall be modified to prevent erosion and conform to
natural dimensions in the shortest possible distance, typically by use of large rip-rap
placed over filter cloth. A stilling basin or outlet protection shall be used to reduce flow
velocities from the principal spillway to non-erosive velocities.
If a pond daylights to a channel with dry weather flow, care should be taken to minimize
tree clearing along the downstream channel, and to reestablish a forested riparian zone
in the shortest possible distance. Excessive use of rip-rap should be avoided to reduce
stream warming.
F.2.2.5 Pond Treatment Criteria  Minimum Water Quality Volume (WQv)
Provide water quality treatment storage to capture the computed WQv from the
contributing drainage area through any combination of permanent pool, extended
detention (WQv-ED) or marsh. The following design considerations must be made:
a. If ED is provided in a pond, storage for Cpv-ED and WQv-ED shall be computed and
routed separately (i.e., the WQv cannot be met simply by providing Cpv storage for
the one year storm). (need definition of Cp)
b. In the Wet Extended Detention Pond Design, at least 50% of the (WQv) should be
stored in the permanent pool.
c. The minimum length to width ratio for the pond is 1.5:1 (i.e., length relative to width).
Long flow paths and irregular shapes are recommended.
d. The perimeter of all deep pool areas (four feet or greater in depth) should be
surrounded by two benches:
1. A safety bench that extends 15 feet outward from the normal water edge to the
toe of the pond side slope. The maximum slope of the safety bench shall be 6%.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-11
2. An aquatic bench that extends up to 15 feet inward from the normal shoreline
and has a maximum depth of eighteen inches below the normal pool water
surface elevation.
F.2.2.6 Landscaping Plan  Wherever possible, wetland plants should be
encouraged in a pond design, either along the aquatic bench (fringe wetlands), the
safety bench and side slopes (ED wetlands) or within shallow areas of the pool itself.
The soils of a pond buffer are often severely compacted during the construction process
to ensure stability. The density of these compacted soils is so great that it effectively
prevents root penetration, and therefore, may lead to premature mortality or loss of
vigor. Consequently, it is advisable to excavate large and deep holes around the
proposed planting sites, and backfill these with uncompacted topsoil. Existing trees
should be preserved in the buffer area during construction. Planting guidance is provided
in Appendix C, Approved Plants.
F.2.2.7 Maintenance Measures  Establishment of a maintenance plan is an
important aspect of STP guidance. On going maintenance is essential to ensure that
STPs operate properly and function as designed.
a. Maintenance responsibility for a pond and its buffer should be vested with a
responsible authority by means of a legally binding and enforceable maintenance
agreement that is executed as a condition of plan approval.
b. The principal spillway should be equipped with a removable trash rack.
c. Sediment removal in the forebay should occur every 5 to 7 years or after 50% of total
forebay capacity has been lost.
d. A maintenance right of way or easement should extend to a pond from a public or
private road. Maintenance access shall be at least 12 feet wide; have a maximum
slope of no more than 15%; and should be appropriately stabilized to withstand
maintenance equipment and vehicles.
e. The maintenance access should extend to the forebay, safety bench, riser, and
outlet.
F.2.2.8 Non-clogging Low Flow Orifice  A non-clogging low flow orifice must
be provided. The low flow orifice shall have a minimum diameter of 6 inches, and shall
be adequately protected from clogging by an acceptable external trash rack. The
preferred method is a submerged reverse-slope pipe that extends downward from the
riser to an inflow point one foot below the normal pool elevation. An alternative method is
to employ a broad crested rectangular, V-notch, or proportional weir, protected by a halfround
corrugated metal pipe (CMP) that extends at least 12 inches below the normal
pool.
F.2.2.9 Riser in Embankment  The riser shall be located within the
embankment for maintenance access, safety and aesthetics. Access to the riser is to be
provided to the SMD.
F.2.2.10 Pond Drain  Each pond shall have a drain pipe that can completely or
partially drain the pond. The drain pipe shall have an elbow within the pond to prevent
sediment deposition, and a diameter capable of draining the pond within 24 hours.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-12
F.2.3 Constructed Wetlands
Stormwater wetlands are practices that create shallow marsh areas to treat urban
stormwater and often incorporate small permanent pools and/or extended detention
storage to achieve the full WQv. Design variants include:
a. Shallow Wetland (Figure F-6)
b. ED Shallow Wetland (Figure F-7)
c. Pond/Wetland System (Figure F-8)
d. "Pocket" Wetland (Figure F-9)

FIGURE F-9 POCKET WETLAND
F.2.3.1 Wetland Feasibility  A water balance should be performed to
demonstrate that a stormwater wetland can withstand a significant drought at summer
evaporation rates without completely drawing down.
Stormwater wetlands should not be located within existing jurisdictional wetlands. In
some isolated cases, a permit may be granted to convert an existing degraded wetland
in the context of local watershed restoration efforts.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-17
F.2.3.2 Wetland Conveyance  Flowpaths from the inflow points to the outflow
points of stormwater wetlands shall be maximized. A minimum flowpath of 2:1 (length to
relative width) should be provided across the stormwater wetland. This path may be
achieved by constructing internal berms (e.g., high marsh wedges or rock filter cells).
F.2.3.3 Wetland Pretreatment Criteria  Sediment regulation is critical to
sustain stormwater wetlands. Consequently, a forebay should be located at the inlet, and
a micropool should be located at the outlet. For forebay design criteria, consult the
previous section on ponds. A micropool three to six feet deep should be used to protect
the low flow pipe from clogging and prevent sediment re-suspension.
F.2.3.4 Wetland Treatment 
a. At least 25% of the WQv should be in deepwater zones with a depth greater than
four feet. The forebay and micropool may meet this criteria. In addition, the
deepwater zones serve to keep mosquito populations in check by providing habitat
for fish and other pond life that prey on mosquito larvae.
b. A minimum of 35% of the total surface area can have a depth of six inches or less,
and at least 65% of the total surface area shall be shallower than 18 inches.
c. If extended detention is utilized in a stormwater wetland, the WQv ED volume
should not comprise more than 50% of the total WQV, and its maximum water
surface elevation should not extend more than three feet above the permanent pool.
Available data suggest that pond designs that rely entirely or primarily on detention
have significantly compromised pollutant removal.
F.2.3.5 Wetland Landscaping  A landscaping plan should be provided that
indicates the methods used to establish and maintain wetland coverage. Minimum
elements of a plan include: delineation of pondscaping zones, a selection of
corresponding plant species, a planting plan, a sequence for preparing wetland bed
(including soil amendments, if needed) and sources of plant material. A plant list is
provided in Appendix C, Approved Plants.
The most common and reliable technique for establishing an emergent wetland
community in a stormwater wetland is to transplant nursery stock obtained from local
aquatic plant nurseries. The following guidance is suggested when transplants are used
to establish a wetland:
a. To add diversity to the wetland, five to seven species of emergent wetland plants
should be planted.
b. No more than half the wetland surface area needs to be planted. If the appropriate
planting depths are achieved, the entire wetland should be colonized within three
years.
c. Individual plants should be planted 18 inches on center in clumps.
d. Because most stormwater wetlands are excavated to deep subsoils, they often lack
the nutrients and organic matter needed to support vigorous growth of wetland
plants. At these sites, three to six inches of topsoil or wetland mulch should be added
to all depth zones in the wetland from one foot below the normal pool to six inches
above.
e. In some cases, the use of "volunteer wetlands," allowing cattails and phragmites to
colonize may be appropriate. Typically it will be difficult to maintain diversity in this
case, and volunteer wetlands may be a low cost alternative.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-18
F.2.3.6 Wetland Maintenance Criteria  If a minimum coverage of 50% is not
achieved in the planted wetland zones after the second growing season, a reinforcement
planting will be required. Stormwater wetlands that are separated from jurisdictional
wetlands and regularly maintained are typically not regulated under State and Federal
laws. Occasional removal of invasive species may be necessary.
F.2.4 Infiltration Practices
Stormwater infiltration practices capture and temporarily store the WQv before allowing it
to infiltrate into the soil over a two day period. Design variants include:
a. Infiltration-Trench (Figure F-10)
b. Infiltration-Basin (Figure F-11)
c. Infiltration Planter Box (Figure F-12)

FIGURE F-12 INFILTRATION PLANTER BOX
Flow-Through Treatment Facilities
F.2.4.1 Guidance for Infiltration Planter Boxes
a. Infiltration Planter Boxes are ideal for very small sites and redevelopment projects.
b. The planters shall be designed to allow captured runoff to drain out in 3 to 4 hours
after a storm event.
c. The sand/gravel area width, depth and length are to be determined by a qualified
professional, or a drywell may be required for complete on-site infiltration.
d. Minimum planter width is 30 inches; there is no minimum length or required shape.
The structural elements of the planters shall be stone, concrete, brick, or pressuretreated
wood. Treated wood shall not leach out toxic chemicals that can contaminate
stormwater.
e. Ideally, planters should be located at least 10ft. from the building.
F.2.4.2 Guidance for Infiltration Trenches and Basins Infiltration Feasibility
 To be suitable for an infiltration facility, underlying soils can have an infiltration rate (fc)
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-22
of 0.52 inches per hour or greater, as initially determined from Natural Resource
Conservation Service (NRCS) soil textural classification, and subsequently confirmed by
field geotechnical tests. The minimum geotechnical testing is one test hole per 5000
square foot (sf), with a minimum of two borings per facility (taken within the proposed
limits of the facility). The following conditions should also be placed on the use of
infiltration:
a. Soils shall also have a clay content of less than 20% and a silt/clay content of less
than 40%.
b. Infiltration cannot be located on slopes greater than 6% or within fill soils.
c. The bottom of the infiltration facility shall be separated by at least four feet vertically
from the seasonally high water table or bedrock layer, as documented by on-site soil
testing.
d. Infiltration facilities should be setback 25 feet down-gradient from structures.
e. The maximum contributing area to an individual infiltration practice should generally
be less than 2 acres.
f. All infiltration practices must be equipped with and overflow as well as cleanouts.
F.2.4.3 Infiltration Conveyance Criteria 
a. All infiltration systems should be designed to fully de-water the entire WQv within 24
hours after the storm event.
b. If runoff is delivered by a storm drain pipe or along the main conveyance system, the
infiltration practice must be designed as an off-line practice.
c. Pretreatment shall be provided for storm drain pipes systems discharging directly to
infiltration systems. Adequate stormwater outfalls shall be provided for the overflow
associated with the ten-year design storm event (non-erosive velocities on the downslope).
F.2.4.4 Infiltration Pretreatment 
a. A minimum pretreatment volume of at least 25% of the WQv must be provided prior
to entry to an infiltration facility, and can be provided in the form of a sedimentation
basin, sump pit, grass channel, plunge pool or other measure. Note that extensive
pretreatment is required because infiltration systems tend to clog easily.
b. Exit velocities from pretreatment chambers shall be non-erosive during the two year
storm.
F.2.4.5 Infiltration Treatment Criteria  Infiltration practices should be designed
to exfiltrate the entire WQv through the floor of each practice. Infiltration practices are
best used in conjunction with other practices. The longevity of infiltration practices is
strongly influenced by the care taken during construction.
F.2.4.6 Infiltration Landscaping Criteria  A dense and vigorous vegetative
cover should be established over the contributing pervious drainage areas before runoff
can be accepted into the facility.
F.2.4.7 Infiltration Maintenance Criteria  An observation well should be
installed in every infiltration trench, consisting of an anchored six-inch diameter
perforated PVC pipe with a lockable cap installed flush with the ground surface.
F.2.5 Bioretention
Stormwater filtering systems capture and temporarily store the WQv and pass it through
a filter bed of sand, organic matter, soil or other media. Filtered runoff may be collected
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-23
and returned to the conveyance system, or allowed to partially exfiltrate into the soil.
Design variants include: Various Sand Filters which are not encouraged in North
Augusta due to high failure rates.
FIGURE F-13 BIORETENTION
F.2.5.1 Filtering Feasibility Criteria  Bioretention is best suited for small
watershed areas, stormwater retrofits for redevelopment, and use in conjunction with
other practices such as water quantity detention.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-24
F.2.5.2 Filtering Conveyance Criteria 
a. If runoff is delivered by a storm drain pipe or is along the main conveyance system,
the filtering practice should be designed off-line.
b. An overflow should be provided within the practice to pass a percentage of the WQv
to a stabilized water course. In addition, overflow for the ten year storm should be
provided to a non-erosive outlet point (i.e., prevent downstream slope erosion).
c. A flow regulator (or flow splitter diversion structure) should be supplied to divert the
WQv to the filtering practice.
d. Bioretention filters should be equipped with a minimum 4" perforated pipe underdrain
(6" is preferred) in a gravel layer. A permeable filter fabric should be placed between
the gravel layer and the filter media.
e. A sedimentation basin prior to the filter will improve performance.
F.2.5.3 Filtering Treatment Criteria 
a. The entire treatment system (including pretreatment) should temporarily hold at least
75% of the WQv prior to filtration.
b. Most filtering practices cannot provide stormwater detention or downstream channel
protection (Qp and Cpv) under most site conditions.
c. The filter area for sand and organic filters should be sized based on the principles of
Darcy's Law. A coefficient of permeability (k) should be used as follows:
The required filter bed area is computed using the following equation:
1. Af = (WQv) (df) / [ (k) (hf + df) (tf)] where
2. Af = Surface area of filter bed (ft2)
3. df = filter bed depth (ft)
4. k = coefficient of permeability of filter media (ft/day)
5. (0.5 ft/day for bioretention planting soil)
6. hf = average height of water above filter bed (ft)
7. tf = design filter bed drain time (days)
8. (1.67 days is the recommended maximum for sand filters; 2 days for
bioretention)
F.2.5.4 Filtering Landscaping Criteria 
a. A dense and vigorous vegetative cover should be established over the contributing
pervious drainage areas before runoff can be accepted into the facility.
b. Landscaping is critical to the performance and function of bioretention areas.
Therefore, a landscaping plan must be provided for bioretention areas. Planting
recommendations for bioretention facilities are as follows:
1. Native plant species should be specified over non-native species.
2. Vegetation should be selected based on a specified zone of hydric tolerance.
3. A selection of trees with an understory of shrubs and herbaceous materials
should be provided.
4. Woody vegetation should not be specified at inflow locations.
5. Trees should be planted primarily along the perimeter of the facility.
A plant list is included in Appendix C, Approved Plants.
F.2.5.5 Bioretention Maintenance 
a. Silt/sediment shall be removed from the filter bed when the accumulation exceeds
one inch.
b. When the filtering capacity of the filter diminishes substantially (i.e., when water
ponds on the surface of the filter bed for more than 48 hours), the top few inches of
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-25
discolored material shall be removed and shall be replaced with fresh material. The
removed sediments should be disposed in an acceptable manner (i.e., landfill).
c. A stone drop of at least six inches shall be provided at the inlet of bioretention
facilities (F-6) (pea gravel diaphragm).
d. Areas devoid of mulch should be re-mulched on an annual basis.
e. Dead or diseased plant material shall be replaced.
f. Direct maintenance access shall be provided to the pretreatment area and the filter
bed.
F.2.6 Open Channel Systems
Open channel systems are vegetated open channels that are explicitly designed to
capture and treat the full WQv within dry or wet cells formed by checkdams or other
means. Design variants include:
a. Dry Swale (Figure F-14)
b. Wet Swale (Figure F-15)
c. Grass Channels (Figure F-16)

F.2.6.1 Open Channel Feasibility Criteria 
a. Open channel systems should have longitudinal slopes less than 4.0% to qualify for
WQv treatment.
b. Open channel systems, designed for WQv treatment, are primarily applicable for
land uses such as roads, highways, residential development, and pervious areas.
c. Often used in conjunction with parking lot or dry detention.

F.2.6.2 Open Channel Conveyance Criteria 
a. The peak velocity for the 2 year storm must be non-erosive.
b. Open channels should be designed to safely convey the ten year storm with a
minimum of 6 inches of freeboard.
c. Channels should be designed with moderate side slopes (flatter than 3:1) for most
conditions.
d. Side slopes should not be steeper than 2:1.
e. The maximum allowable temporary ponding time within a channel should be less
than 48 hours.
f. Open channel systems which directly receive runoff from impervious surfaces may
have a 6 inch drop onto a protected shelf (pea gravel diaphragm) to minimize the
clogging potential of the inlet.
g. An underdrain system should be provided for the dry swale to ensure a maximum
ponding time of 48 hours.
F.2.6.3 Open Channel Pretreatment Criteria 
a. Pretreatment of 0.1 inch of runoff per impervious acre storage should be provided.
This storage is usually obtained by providing checkdams at pipe inlets and/or
driveway crossings.
b. A pea gravel diaphragm and gentle side slopes should be provided along the top of
channels to provide pretreatment for lateral sheet flows.
F.2.6.4 Open Channel Treatment Criteria 
a. Dry and wet swales should be designed to temporarily store the WQv within the
facility to be released over a maximum of 48 hour duration.
b. Open channels should have a bottom width no wider than 8 feet to avoid potential
gullying and channel braiding.
c. Dry and wet swales should maintain a maximum ponding depth of one foot at the
"mid-point" of the channel, and a maximum depth of 18" at the end point of the
channel (for storage of the WQv).
d. Grass channels should be designed to retain the water quality volume in the practice
for a minimum of 10 minutes, with no greater than a 1.0 fps velocity. Note that the
grass channel design is the only practice with a "rate-based" design. The designer
determines the peak flow rate from the water quality storm event, and then uses
Manning's equation to ensure that the velocity required to retain flow can be
achieved with the channel's cross section and slope.
F.2.6.5 Open Channel Landscaping Criteria 
a. Wet swales are not recommended for residential developments as they can create
potential nuisance or mosquito breeding conditions.
b. Landscape design should specify proper grass species and wetland plants based on
specific site, soils and hydric conditions present along the channel.
F.2.6.6 Open Channel Maintenance Criteria  Open channel systems and
grass filter strips should be mowed as required during the growing season, to maintain
grass heights in the 4 to 6 inches range. Wet swales, employing wetland vegetation, do
not require frequent mowing of the channel. Sediment build-up within the bottom of the
channel or filter strip should be removed when 25% of the original WQv volume has
been exceeded.

North Augusta Development Code F-30
F.2.7 Better Site Design
F.2.7.1 Traditional Cul-de-sac Alternatives 
a. Description  Cul-de-sac alternatives are designs for end-of-street vehicle
turnaround that replace the traditional cul-de-sac and reduce the amount of
impervious cover created in a residential neighborhood. Cul-de-sacs are local access
streets with a closed circular end that allows for vehicle turnarounds. Many of these
cul-de-sacs can have a radius of more than 40 feet. From a stormwater perspective,
cul-de-sacs create a huge bulb of impervious cover, increasing the amount of
stormwater runoff. For this reason, reducing the impervious area of cul-de-sacs
through the use of islands or eliminating them altogether can reduce the amount of
impervious cover created at a site.
b. There are two alternatives to the traditional 40-foot cul-de-sac approved for use in
North Augusta, which create less impervious cover. These include loop roads
(including the option of narrower one-way loop roads serving four to five homes) or
creating pervious islands in the middle of the traditional cul-de-sac.
c. Applicability  Cul-de-sac alternatives can be applied in the design of residential,
commercial and mixed-use developments. A center island can also be used as an
infiltration or bioretention water quality treatment practice.
d. Maintenance Considerations  If islands are constructed as part of a turnaround,
these areas will need to be maintained. Kept as a natural area, the costs could be
minimal. Bioretention areas will also require maintenance.
F.2.7.2 Open Space Design 
a. Description  Open space design, also known as conservation development or
cluster development, is a better site design technique that concentrates dwelling
units in a compact area in one portion of the development site in exchange for
providing open space and natural areas elsewhere on the site. The minimum lot
sizes, setbacks and frontage distances for the residential zone are relaxed in order to
create the open space at the site. Open space designs have many benefits in
comparison to the conventional subdivisions that they replace: they can reduce
impervious cover, stormwater pollutants, construction costs, grading, and the loss of
natural areas. In North Augusta, the Planned Development process is used to pursue
this type of development. It should also be noted that the benefits of open space
design are amplified when combined with other better site design techniques such as
cul-de-sac alternatives and open channels.
b. Maintenance Considerations  Once established, common open space and natural
conservation areas must be managed by a responsible party able to maintain the
areas in a natural state in perpetuity. Typically, the open space is protected by legally
enforceable deed restrictions, conservation easements and maintenance
agreements. In most communities, the authority for managing open space falls to a
homeowner or community association or a land trust.
c. Annual maintenance tasks for open space managed as natural areas are almost
non-existent, and the annual maintenance cost for managing an acre of natural area
is less than $75 (CWP, 1998). It may be useful to develop a habitat plan for natural
areas that may require periodic management actions.
d. Effectiveness  Recent redesign research indicates that open space design can
provide impressive pollutant reduction benefits compared to the conventional
subdivisions they replace. For example, the Center for Watershed Protection (1998)
reported that nutrient export declined by 45% to 60% when two conventional
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-31
subdivisions were redesigned as open space subdivisions. Other researchers have
reported similar levels of pollutant reductions when conventional subdivisions were
replaced by open space subdivisions (Maurer, 1996; DE DNREC, 1997; Dreher,
1994; and SCCCL, 1995). In all cases, the reduction in pollutants was due primarily
to the sharp drop in runoff caused by the lower impervious cover associated with
open space subdivisions. And indeed, in the redesign studies cited above,
impervious cover declined by an average of 34% when open space designs were
utilized.
1. Along with reduced imperviousness, open space designs provide a host of other
environmental benefits lacking in most conventional designs. These
developments reduce potential pressure to encroach on resource and buffer
areas, as enough open space is usually reserved to accommodate resource
protection areas. As less land is cleared during the construction process, the
potential for soil erosion is also greatly diminished. Perhaps most importantly,
open space design reserves 25% - 50% of the development site in green space
that would not otherwise be protected, preserving a greater range of landscapes
and habitat "islands" that can support considerable diversity in mammals,
songbirds and other wildlife.
e. Cost Considerations  Open space developments can be significantly less
expensive to build than conventional subdivisions. Most of the cost savings are due
to savings in road building and stormwater management conveyance costs. In fact,
the use of open space design techniques at a residential development in Davis,
California provided an estimated infrastructure construction costs savings of $800
per home (Liptan and Brown, 1996). Other examples demonstrate infrastructure
costs savings ranging from 11 to 66%.
1. While open space developments are frequently less expensive to build,
developers find that these properties often command higher prices than homes in
more conventional developments. Several regional studies estimate that
residential properties in open space developments garner premiums that are 5 to
32% higher than conventional subdivisions and moreover, sell or lease at an
increased rate. In Massachusetts, cluster developments were found to appreciate
12% faster than conventional subdivisions over a twenty year period (Lacey and
Arendt, 1990).
2. In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, the reduced impervious cover and
increased tree canopy associated with open space development reduces the size
and cost of downstream stormwater treatment facilities.
F.2.7.3 Alternative Pavers 
a. Description  Alternative pavers are permeable or semi-permeable surfaces that
can replace asphalt and concrete and can be used for overflow parking lots and
walkways. From a stormwater perspective, this is important because alternative
pavers can replace impervious surfaces, creating less stormwater runoff. The two
broad categories of alternative pavers are paving blocks and other surfaces including
gravel, cobbles, wood, mulch, brick, and natural stone.
b. Porous Pavement  Porous pavement is a more expensive but effective surface
used to reduce runoff. These products may be especially applicable to
redevelopment areas. Porous pavement is targeted for driveways, walking trails,
parking lots, playgrounds, open spaces, and golf cart paths. Porous pavement
techniques only work if the design engineer takes into account the proper selection
of technique for the location, the design is correct, and the structure is built properly.
If any of these considerations are not done correctly, the structure may fail.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-32
Researchers at the University of Georgia have identified nine categories of porous
pavements. Below is a brief overview of each.
1. Decks are level or elevated wooden structures that can serve as porous
pavements. They are beneficial in situations where they can be built around
existing environments such as wetlands.
2. Open celled paving grids are open spaces with ribbing in between. They can be
difficult to walk on and it takes time to grow turf over the grids. They work well in
open spaces. They can be used in low-traffic areas such as loading areas and
emergency access lanes.
3. Open-graded aggregate is the most permeable material and the lowest-cost that
you can get. About 30 to 40 percent of the material is void space and its
permeability is measured in thousands of inches per hour.
4. Open-jointed paving blocks are segmental pavers that can handle high weights
and heavy traffic. Paving blocks are cement or plastic grids with gaps between
them. Paving blocks make the surface more rigid and gravel or grass planted
inside the holes allows for infiltration. Depending on the use and soil types, a
gravel layer can be added underneath to prevent settling and allow further
infiltration.
5. Plastic geocells are plastic cells held together with ribs and filled with aggregate
or turf. They can be used for a variety of activities including emergency-access
lanes, auxiliary parking areas, trails, pedestrian and wheelchair access ways, golf
cart paths.
6. Porous asphalt can be used as an overlay on parking lots.
7. Pervious concrete is created by mixing water and cement-like materials into a
paste that forms a thick coating around aggregate particles. It contains little or
no sand and forms a highly permeable surface. It is advocated as a BMP by the
EPA. It can be used in waste transfer stations and low traveled parking areas.
8. Porous turf is used by itself and with reinforcements. It is used for parking lots
and open spaces.
9. Soft paving materials such as wood mulch, crushed shell, and other organic
material can be used for areas of pedestrian traffic.
c. Applicability  Alternative pavers can replace conventional asphalt or concrete in
parking lots, driveways, and walkways. At the same time, traffic volume and type can
limit application. For this reason, alternative pavers for parking are recommended
only for overflow areas. In residential areas, alternative surfaces can be used for
walkways, but are not ideal for areas that require handicap accessibility.
d. Siting and Design Criteria  Accessibility, climate, soil type, traffic volume and long
term performance should be considered along with costs and stormwater quality
controls when choosing paving materials. Soil types will affect the infiltration rates
and should also be considered when using alternative pavers. Clay soils (D soils) will
limit the infiltration on a site. It is important to consider that failure of porous surfaces
can occur. These failures can be a result of poor design, inadequate construction
techniques, low soil permeability, heavier traffic use than designed for, or resurfacing
with a non porous material. If you are considering these techniques for your
projects, strict adherence to the design standards and construction methods must be
used.
e. The durability and maintenance cost of alternative pavers also limits use to low traffic
volume areas. At the same time, alternative pavers can abate stormwater
management costs. Used in combination with other better site design techniques, the
cumulative effect on stormwater can be dramatic.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-33
f. Benefits  The most obvious benefit of utilizing alternative pavers includes reduction
or elimination of other stormwater management techniques. Applied in combination
with techniques like bioretention, pollutant removal and stormwater management can
be further improved.
g. Limitations  Alternative pavers are not recommended for high traffic volumes for
durability reasons. Access for wheelchairs is limited with alternative pavers. In
addition, snow removal is also difficult since plows cannot be used, sand can cause
the system to clog, and salt can be a potential pollutant.
h. Effectiveness  Alternative pavers provide better water quality effectiveness than
conventional asphalt or concrete and the range of effectiveness depends on the type
of paver. Table F-6 provides a list of pavers and the range of water quality
effectiveness for different types of alternative pavers.

F.2.8 Proprietary Treatment Practices
Water quality regulatory requirements affecting communities has created a need for new
technologies that not only improve water quality from storm sewers and other devices
but also remain cost effective. This chapter will give a brief overview of the types of
technologies that are available for use in storm treatment processes. There are many
other available techniques and technologies available.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-34
Pollutant removal effectiveness of the practices found in this manual will obviously vary
widely based on site conditions and practice design. There are many programs
available to determine pollutant removal rates for all practices covered here. In addition,
vendors of proprietary treatment practices size their product based on specific site
conditions.
A general overview of pollutant removal rates for some of the more common STPs is
presented in the following narrative. Most of the information presented regarding
pollutant removal rates is represented by the company that promotes the specific
product. The City of North Augusta has not verified that the removal rates are accurate
and will expect that design engineers that intend to use these products verify the
accuracy of the statements to the best of their ability.
F.2.8.1 In-ground Technologies  The following technologies are used within
the storm water sewer system to separate and remove pollutants
F.2.8.2 Storm Pure Catch Basin Inserts  For areas where potential pollutant
loads are higher (roadways, parking lots, loading areas), a catch basin insert will provide
greater protection to by filtering stormwater. ADSs Nyoplast Division offers Storm-Pure
inserts. The Storm-PURE catch basin insert (Figure F-17), a two-stage unit that will fit
into new or existing catch basins will remove suspended solids, hydrocarbons and other
pollutants. Rates of removal are available from the company.
FIGURE F-17 STORMPURE CATCH BASIN INSERT
F.2.8.3 CDS Unit (Continuous deflective separation)  This technology that uses
a non-blocking, non-mechanical screening process to remove pollutants from storm
water flow and combined sewer overflows (Figure F-18). The unit captures fine sands
and solids and are capable of removing more than 80% of annual TSS from stormwater.
It is said to move 100% of floatables and 100% of particles that are equal to or greater
than one-half the size of the screen opening. The system comes in an off-line unit also.
The units come with a conventional oil baffle to control oil and grease. They can be fitted
with the CDS Media Filtration System cartridges that can target project specific
pollutants as well.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-35
FIGURE F-18 INLINE CDS UNIT
F.2.8.4 Stormceptor®  The stormceptor captures pollutants from stormwater as
it passes through the system. The system is based on an internal bypass system that
eliminates up to 80% of TSS and 98% of free oils and hydrocarbons (Figure F-19).
Under normal operating conditions (more than 90% of all storm events), storm water
flows into the upper chamber and is diverted by a sloped weir into the lower chamber.
Flow is diverted by horizontal outlets around the walls of the lower chamber, settling out
coarse and fine sediments to the floor of the chamber. Petroleum products rise and
become trapped beneath the fiberglass insert. During infrequent, high flow events (less
than 10% of all storm events), storm water flows pass over the diverting weir into the
downstream sewer system, preventing scouring of previously trapped pollutants. The
high flow by-pass prevents previously collected pollutants from scour and re-suspension.
The Inlet Stormceptor® takes the place of a traditional inlet structure in a storm sewer
system. The Inlet Stormceptor® is ideal for small drainage areas, such as truck loading
bays, electrical transformer stations, and vehicle refueling stations.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-36
FIGURE F-19 STORMCEPTOR® DEVICE
F.2.8.5 Vortechnics  The Vortecnics system is available for manhole and
vault configurations. It is a filter technology system that removes very fine particulates.
It uses sedimentation, floatation, and filtration methods (Figure F-20). Vortechnics
System is a concrete, underground structure comprised of three chambers  an initial
grit chamber that concentrates and deposits sediments, an oil chamber and baffle wall
that traps floatables, and a flow control chamber. The system removes 80% of total
suspended solids.
FIGURE F-20 VORTECHNICS SYSTEM
F.2.8.6 Ecostorm  The Ecostorm consists of 2 circular concentric precast
structures. An outer structure forms the swirl-chamber/vortex separator, the inner
cylinder serves as a floatables collection chamber and outlet chamber (Figure F-21).
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-37
Swirl-chamber technology combined with vortex design principles, effectively treat the
stormwater by removing and retaining sediments and floatables from site runoff.
FIGURE F-21 ECOSTORM
F.2.8.7 StormTech  StormTech develops control systems for stormwater
runoff that maintain the balance between land development and the protection of natural
resources. StormTech chambers have been subjected to advanced in-ground testing
protocols and high-level industry expert review. They have been evaluated to support
HS-20 live loads following current AASHTO procedures for loads, structural capacity and
factor of safety when installed per StormTech's Chamber Installation Instructions.
StormTech chambers are molded from Polypropylene resin and chemicals typically
found in stormwater runoff. StormTech recommends using the Isolator Row Inlet Control
System or a treatment train approach. The Isolator Row has been tested for sediment
removal efficiency and can be a stand-alone sediment control system. The treatment
train approach incorporates a pretreatment device prior to the Isolator Row and an
eccentric header for coarse or heavy materials removal.
The Isolator Row is a row of chambers wrapped in filter fabric. Runoff is directed into the
Isolator Row via a manhole or basin with a diversion weir. When the Isolator Row
reaches capacity, storm water overtops the weir and flows to the other chambers
through a header system.
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-38
FIGURE F-22 STORMTECH SYSTEM
F.2.8.8 Conspan Stormvault  The Stormvault Mitigation System by
CON/SPAN® is a below grade detention and sedimentation vault. Stormwater is
discharged with TSS concentration of less than 20 mg/L with a 95% level of confidence,
independent of influent concentrations or inflow volume. Detention time promotes
sedimentation of particles less than 70 microns.
F.2.8.9 Filterra®  Filterra® relies on a specially engineered high flow rate
treatment system to provide exceptional pollutant removal. Monitoring data shows
Filterra® can treat over 90% of the total annual volume of rainfall with maximum
pollutant removal rates reaching 95% for total suspended solids, 82% total phosphorus,
76% total nitrogen and 91% heavy metals (measured as Cu).
The high pollutant removal efficiency is primarily due the multiple treatment systems
inherent in its unique plant / soil / microbe treatment media. Its unique design and use of
typical landscape plants also provides many added values such as low maintenance
costs, enhanced aesthetics, improved habitat value, and easy / safe inspection.
The system consists of a concrete container, a 3-inch mulch layer, 1.5 to 3.5 feet of a
unique soil filter media, an observation / cleanout pipe, an under-drain system and an
appropriate type of plant i.e., flowers, grasses, shrub, or tree (see photo in Figure F-23).
Stormwater runoff drains directly from impervious surfaces through an inlet structure in
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-39
the concrete box and flows through the mulch, plant, and soil filter media. Treated water
flows out of the system via an under-drain connected to a storm drain pipe or other
appropriate outfall. The at-the-source treatment strategy is highly adaptable for any
urban setting to achieve multiple stormwater management water quality and quantity
goals including combined sewer overflow control.

F.2.8.10 Alternative Paver Systems  Grass Pave/Gravel Pave
a. Grasspave2 is a structure which provides incredible load bearing strength while
protecting vegetation root systems from deadly compaction. High void spaces within
the entire cross-section enable excellent root development, and storage capacity for
rainfall from storm events. It is a turf based system that consists of a sandy gravel
base course, a Hydrogrow polymer fertilizer mixture, the Grasspave ring and grid
structure, sharp concrete sand, and grass seed or sod (Figure F-24). Runoff moves
through the surfaces allowing suspended sediments to drop out. Table F-8 shows
expected storage volumes.

b. Gravelpave2 is comprised of a porous geotextile fabric, molded directly to the one
inch high integrated ring and grid system (Figure F-25). Gravelpave2 sits atop an
engineered porous base course, is anchored down with galvanized anchors, and is
filled with decorative gravel. It is a structure to provide heavy load bearing support
and true containment of gravel to create a porous pavement surface with unlimited
traffic volume and/or duration time for parking. When used with a proper porous base
course material, Gravelpave2 can provide a void space of 35% for storage volume of
rainfall during rain events. For example, an 8" deep cross-section would store 2.8" of
rain.

F.2.9 Water Quality Credits
F.2.9.1 Stream Buffer or Filter Strip Credit  This credit encourages the use of
stream buffers and filter strips to treat stormwater runoff at the site level. Specific criteria

g. Disconnections discharging over relatively permeable soils (HSGs A and B) do not
require geotechnical testing.
The water quality credit can be calculated with the following equation:
APPENDIX F  STORMWATER QUALITY
North Augusta Development Code F-44
C = (AD/AI)WQv
Where:
a. C = Impervious area disconnection credit (ac-ft)
b. AD = Disconnected Impervious Area (acres)
c. A = Total site area (acres)
d. AI = Site Impervious Area (acres)
e. WQv = Original Water Quality Volume.
Water quality volumes are then reduced by the credit (C). Quantity credit is achieved by
assigning disconnected rooftops a curve number equal to forest in good condition. The
example in Figure F-27 illustrates how this credit would be applied.

services to provide locations for buried utilities. The Contractor shall obtain all
necessary permits (grading, building, water, sewer, encroachment, etc.) prior to
beginning work.
c. Clearing: Clearing shall consist of the felling and cutting up, or the trimming of
trees, and the satisfactory disposal of the trees and other vegetation together with
the timber, snags, brush and rubbish occurring within the construction area.
Individual trees and groups of trees designated to be left standing within cleared
areas shall be trimmed of all branches to such heights and in such manner as may
be necessary to prevent interference with the construction operations. All limbs and
branches required to be trimmed shall be neatly cut close to the trunk of the tree or
to main branches, and the cuts thus made shall be painted with an approved treewound
paint. Individual trees, groups of trees and other vegetation to be left
standing, shall be protected from damage as necessary. Clearing operations shall be
carefully conducted to prevent damage to trees left standing, existing structures and
improvements, and to provide for the safety of employees the public and adjoining
properties.
d. Grubbing: Grubbing shall consist of the removal and disposal of all stumps and
roots from the site as indicated on the drawings. In foundation and sub-base areas,
stumps, roots, logs, timber and other debris not suitable for foundation or sub-base
purposes shall be excavated to a depth not less than 18 inches below any subgrade,
shoulder or slope. All depressions excavated below the original ground surface for
the removal of stumps and roots shall be refilled with suitable material and
compacted to make the surface conform to the surrounding ground.
1. All timber, logs, stumps, roots, brush, rotten wood and other refuse from the
clearing and grubbing operation shall be removed from the site and disposed of
as approved by the Engineer.
e. Site Grading: Site grading shall consist of excavating, backfilling, and compacting

North Augusta Development Code D-3
1. Fill material shall be as specified on the drawings or elsewhere in these
specifications and shall be free of roots, trash and any other deleterious material.
2. Topsoil shall be stripped from all areas prior to grading and shall be stored for
use during restoration. Topsoil shall consist of a natural material that occurs in
surface deposits of limited depth and shall be free of stones larger than 2 inches
in diameter, roots, excessive vegetation, rubbish or other deleterious matter.
Topsoil shall be approved by the Engineer before use.
f. Fill Placement: Suitable material removed from excavation shall be used, where
feasible, in the formation of embankments, fills, subgrades, shoulders, backfills, and
site grading. Excess material from excavations, not suitable for such uses, shall be
wasted on site or removed from the site as required. If a waste area is not
designated, the material shall be hauled from the site and disposed of in a manner
acceptable to the Engineer. Wetting, drying, hauling, scarifying, mixing, shaping,
rolling, tamping, de-watering or other operation shall be performed by the Contractor
as approved by the Engineer. Such operations shall be considered incidental to the
sitework and shall be performed at no additional expense to the Owner.
1. Embankments, fills and excavations shall be properly shaped and drained to
prevent water from running into the excavations. Any water which accumulates
in excavations shall be removed promptly and the saturated soil shall be
removed and replaced with approved fill material.
g. Compaction: All backfill and embankments shall be constructed with approved fill
material consisting of sand, clay, gravel, or a combination thereof. No organic or silty
materials shall be utilized. Approved material shall be placed in horizontal layers of
loose material not to exceed 8 inches in depth. Each layer shall then be compacted
utilizing sheepsfoot, vibrator, or mechanical rollers. Compaction shall be made to the
percent of maximum dry density as shown in the table below.
1. The Engineer, at his discretion, may order tests and inspections to be performed
during the progress of the work, or at the completion of any individual unit of
work, or at the time of final inspection of the entire project. Maximum dry density
shall be as determined by ASTM D698 or AASHTO T-99 Method, Standard

sand-cone method or nuclear moisture/density gauge. These tests will be
performed by an approved independent soil testing laboratory. The costs of
these tests shall be borne by the Contractor. All fills not meeting the compaction
requirements shall be removed and re-compacted until the desired compaction is
achieved.
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-4
h. Finish Grading: Except as otherwise specified herein, all disturbed areas on the
site shall be finished off to a uniformly smooth surface, free from abrupt, irregular
surface changes. The finished surface shall be not more than 0.10 feet above or
below the established grade. There shall be no roots, waste building materials, trash
or other unsightly matter projecting through or visible at the surface.
1. After all embankments and fills have been completed to grade, and after all
structures and pipe lines requiring the use of heavy equipment have been
completed, excavation necessary for the construction of walkways and steps
may be performed. Excavation shall be accurately cut to line and grade;
sufficient width for the accurate placement and adequate support of the forms
shall be allowed. After the forms are removed, the backfill shall be replaced and
re-compacted around the walks and steps. Care shall be taken to avoid damage
to the walks and steps.
2. Topsoil shall be evenly spread over the entire area to receive vegetation cover.
The compacted subgrade shall be scarified to a depth of 2 inches for the bonding
of topsoil with the subsoil. Topsoil shall then be evenly spread, compacted and
graded to a uniform thickness of not less than 3 inches, and the surface shall
conform to the requirements of site grading, ditches, embankments, or other
features, as applicable.
3. Ditches shall be cut accurately to line, grade, and cross-section. Any excessive
ditch excavation shall be backfilled to grade with material approved by the
Engineer. The degree of smoothness shall be that usually obtainable with string
line or hand raking methods; the finished surface of ditch slopes shall not be
more than 0.10 feet above or below the appropriate elevations. Random spot
checks of elevations and slopes shall be conducted by ordinary differential level
and profile methods
i. Rock: Rock will not be classified as such for additional payment. The Contractor
shall make appropriate site investigations to satisfy himself as to rock and other
materials which may be encountered on the project.
j. Erosion and Sedimentation Control: Siltation and soil erosion shall be controlled
by the Contractor using the appropriate erosion control devices including but not
limited to silt fence, hay bales, stone check dams, temporary sediment basins,
temporary ground cover, etc. Erosion control structures shall be maintained until
permanent grassing has been established and shall be removed when directed by
the Engineer.
D.3 TRENCH EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL

b. Existing Improvements: Streets, sidewalks, driveways, power/ cable/telephone
lines, gas lines, water lines, sewers, storm drains and other existing improvements
shall be maintained and protected from damage. Any aerial, surface or subsurface
improvements damaged during the course of the work shall be repaired to the
satisfaction of the Engineer. Satisfactory provisions shall be made for the
maintenance of traffic on streets, driveways, and walkways.
1. Prior to any excavation, the Contractor shall notify all utilities and utility locating
services to provide locations for buried utilities. The Contractor shall obtain all
necessary permits (grading, building, water, sewer, encroachment, etc.) prior to
beginning work.
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-5
c. Tree Protection: Care shall be exercised to protect trees to be left standing. Within
the branch spread of such trees, all trenching shall be performed with extra care.
The trench shall be opened when the work can be installed immediately. Injured
roots shall be pruned cleanly and backfill placed as soon as possible.
d. Excavation: Trench excavations shall be made by the open cut method to the
depths indicated on the drawings or as otherwise specified. All excavated materials
not suitable for backfill shall be wasted on site or removed from the site as directed.
1. The excavated trench shall be at least 12 inches wider but not more than 16
inches wider than the outside diameter of the pipe being installed. The trench
shall be excavated true to line to provide 6 inches to 8 inches clearance on each
side of the pipe. The bottom of the trench shall be accurately graded to provide
uniform bearing and support along the pipe barrel. Bell holes shall be excavated
to allow sufficient space to make the joint and to insure that the pipe will rest
evenly on the bottom of the trench. Bell hole dimensions shall be as
recommended by the pipe manufacturer. Excavations for structures and other
accessories shall be sufficient to provide at least 12 inches clearance between
the structure and the trench wall.
2. If rock is encountered, the trench shall be excavated to a minimum depth 6
inches below the pipe. The trench shall then be backfilled with select material,
compacted in place, to the depth required for pipe installation. Wet or other
unsuitable material encountered in the trench bottom shall be removed to a depth
required to gain sufficient bearing strength as directed by the Engineer. The
trench shall then be backfilled with select material, compacted in place, to the
depth required for pipe installation. If rock or other unsuitable material is
encountered in the excavation for structures, the excavated area below the
structure shall be backfilled with stone or concrete as directed by the Engineer
e. Stockpiling Excavated Material: Material excavated from the trench that is suitable
for backfill shall be stockpiled a safe distance away from the excavation to allow
room for adequate angle of repose and to protect the excavation. No material may
be placed within three feet of the nearest edge of the trench. Material unsuitable for
backfilling, as determined by the Engineer, shall be wasted on site or removed from
the site and disposed of by the Contractor, as approved by the Engineer.
f. Shoring and Sheeting: All shoring, sheeting, and bracing required to perform and
protect the excavation and to safeguard employees and the public shall be
performed. Whenever sheeting is driven to depth below the elevation of the top of
the pipe, that portion of the sheeting below the elevation for the top of the pipe shall
not be disturbed or removed. Sheeting left in place shall be cut off not less than 1
foot below finished grade. No sheeting shall be removed until the excavation is
substantially backfilled as hereinafter specified.
g. Water Removal: The Contractor shall be required to control groundwater and
prevent the accumulation of water within excavations. Well pointing, pumping, or
other methods shall be as approved by the Engineer. The Contractor shall also
control surface water runoff to prevent the accumulation of water in excavated
trenches. Water shall not be allowed to rise in open excavations after pipe or
structures have been placed. No work shall be performed within the trench until the
Contractor demonstrates that groundwater and surface water runoff is controlled. If
water accumulates within an excavation, the Contractor will be required to remove
the water and saturated materials and backfill with approved material. Water
removed from excavations shall be discharged at points where it will not damage
adjacent property or facilities.
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-6
h. Blasting: Explosives are to be used only within legal limitations. Before explosives
are used, all necessary permits for this work shall be secured and all precautions
taken in the blasting operations to prevent damage to property, persons, or facilities.
The Contractor shall assume full liability for any damage that may occur during the
use of explosives. No blast shall be set off within fifty (50) feet of existing pipe or
pipe already installed in the trench.
i. Backfilling: Trenches and other excavations shall not be backfilled until all required
tests are performed and the work has been approved by the Engineer. The trenches
shall then be carefully backfilled with approved excavated materials or other material
approved by the Engineer. Backfill shall not contain organic material, blasted rock,
broken concrete or pavement, construction debris, frozen earth, etc.
1. For backfill up to a level 1 foot over the top of pressure pipelines and 2 feet
above the top of gravity pipelines, only selected materials shall be used. Select
materials shall be finely divided material free from debris, organic material and
rock, and may be suitable job excavated material or shall be provided by the
Contractor from other sources. The backfill shall be placed in uniform layers not
exceeding 6 inches in depth. Each layer shall be moistened and carefully and
uniformly tamped with mechanical tampers or other suitable tools to 95%
standard proctor compaction. Each layer shall be placed and tamped under the
pipe haunches with care and thoroughness so as to eliminate the possibility of
voids or lateral displacement.
2. The remainder of the backfill material shall then be placed and compacted above
the level specified above. In areas not subject to traffic, the backfill shall be
placed in 12-inch layers, and each layer moistened and compacted to a density
approximating that of the surrounding earth. Under roadways, driveways, paved
areas, parking lots, along roadway shoulders and other areas subject to traffic,
the backfill shall be placed in 6-inch layers and each layer moistened and
compacted to 95% standard proctor compaction. Any trenches which are
improperly backfilled, or where settlement occurs, shall be reopened to the depth
required for proper compaction, then refilled and compacted with the surface
restored to the required grade and compaction. Along all portions of the trenches
not located in roadways, the ground shall be graded to a reasonable uniformity
and the mounding over the trenches left in a neat condition satisfactory to the
Engineer. All compaction shall be verified by nuclear density gauge on a random
basis as specified by the Engineer in the field. Compaction tests shall be paid for
by the Contractor.
3. Sheeting not specified to be left in place shall be removed as the backfilling
progresses. Sheeting shall be removed in such a manner as to avoid caving the
trench. Voids left by the removal of sheeting and shoring shall be carefully filled
and compacted. Where, in the opinion of the Engineer, damage is liable to result
from withdrawing sheeting, the sheeting will be ordered to be left in place.
j. Pavement Replacement: The Contractor shall replace or repair all
road/street/highway pavement and sidewalks that are damaged by this construction
as specified herein and/or as required by the SCDOT Highway Encroachment .
k. Pavement repairs shall be made by saw-cutting the existing pavement outside the
damaged area to provide eight inches of bearing on undisturbed soil on each side of
the excavation. The existing asphalt and/or concrete and/or base materials shall be
removed to the depth required to place the patch. The following requirements are
minimum thickness and in all cases the patch shall not be less than the existing
pavement thickness.

vertical separation of 18 inches between the outside of the water main and
the outside of the sewer. This shall be the case whether the water main is
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-11
either above or below the sewer line. Whenever possible, the water main
shall be located above the sewer line. Where a new water main crosses a
new sewer line, a full length of pipe shall be used for both the water main and
sewer line and the crossing shall be arranged so that the joints of each line
will be as far as possible from the point of crossing and each other. Where a
new water main crosses an existing sewer line, one full length of water pipe
shall be located so both joints will be as far from the sewer line as possible.
Where a water main crosses under a sewer, adequate structural support shall
be provided for the sewer line to prevent damage to the water main.
c. Special Conditions: When it is impossible to obtain the distances specified
above, the Engineer may allow an alternative design. Any alternative design
shall:
1. Maximize the distances between the water main and sewer line and the
joints of each:

1. Push-On Joints: Push-on type joints shall be assembled by inserting a
continuous, molded, rubber ring gasket in an annular recess in the pipe socket
and forcing the spigot end of the entering pipe into the socket, thereby
compressing the gasket radically to the pipe to form a positive seal. The design
and shape of the gasket and the annular recess shall be such that the gasket is
locked in place against displacement as the joint is assembled. Details of the
joint design shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's standard practice.
The size and shape of the gasket shall be suitable to provide adequate
compressive force between the spigot and the socket after assembly to effect a
positive seal under all combinations of joints and gasket tolerances.
2. Mechanical Joints: The last 8 inches of the spigot and inside of the bell of
mechanical joint pipe shall be thoroughly cleaned and approved lubricant
applied. The cast-iron gland shall then be slipped on the spigot end of the pipe.
The rubber gasket shall be placed on the spigot end with the thick edge toward
the gland. The entire section of the pipe shall be pushed forward to seat the
spigot end in the bell. The gasket shall then be pressed into place within the bell,
being careful to have the gasket evenly positioned around the entire joint. The
cast-iron gland shall be moved into position for bolting, all bolts inserted, with the

following formulas:
P.V.C. Pipe Ductile Iron Pipe
L = ND x ?P or L = SD?P
7400 133.2
L = Allowable leakage in gallons per hour
N = Number of joints in the length of line under test
D = Nominal diameter of pipe, in inches
P = Average test pressure, in psi
S = Length (Ft.)
If any test discloses leakage greater than that allowed above, the Contractor
shall locate and repair the defect until leakage is within the specified allowances.

on the amount of new construction but must include all dead-end lines, be
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-16
representative of the water in the newly constructed mains, and shall be collected
a minimum of every 1,200 linear feet. Prior to sampling, the chlorine residual
must be reduced to normal system residual levels or be non-detectable in those
systems not chlorinating. These samples must be collected at least twenty-four
(24) hours apart and must show the water line to be absent of total coliform
bacteria. The chlorine residual must also be measured and reported. If the
membrane filter method of analysis is used for the coliform analysis, non-coliform
growth must also be reported. If the non-coliform growth is greater than eighty
(80) colonies per one hundred (100) milliliters, the sample result is invalid and
must be repeated. All samples must be analyzed by a State of South Carolina
certified laboratory.
m. Clean Up and Demobilization: Upon completion of the installation of the water lines
and appurtenances, all equipment and debris remaining as a result of the
Contractor's operations shall be removed from the site. Any salvaged material shall

AWWA C651. Before being placed in service, all new mains and repaired portions of
existing mains shall be thoroughly flushed and chlorinated with not less than fifty
parts per million (50 ppm) of available chlorine. Chlorine gas or seventy percent
high-test calcium hypochlorite may be used. Water from the existing distribution
system or other source of supply should be controlled to flow slowly into the newly
laid pipeline during the application of chlorine. The solution should be retained in the
pipeline for not less than twenty-four (24) hours and a chlorine residual of 25 ppm
should be available at this time. The system should then be flushed with potable
water and the sampling program started.
1. Chemicals: The Contractor shall furnish all chemicals required for sterilizing.
The Contractor shall exercise care in the use of water to ensure that highly
chlorinated water does not enter the existing water system.
2. Sampling: At least two satisfactory bacteriological samples shall be taken from
the water line after sterilization. These samples shall be taken 24 hours apart
and tested by a South Carolina state certified private laboratory. The cost of
these tests shall be borne by the Contractor. Prior to bacteriological sampling,
the chlorine residual must be reduced to normal system levels. During
bacteriological sampling, the chlorine residual must also be measured and
reported. Non-coliform growth must also be reported. If the non-coliform growth
is greater than 80 colonies/100mL, the sample result is invalid and must be
repeated.
o. As-Built Drawing: As the work progresses, a record shall be made on all changes
to and deviations from the Plans. As-Built drawings shall be furnished to the City
before acceptance of all water systems.
p. Material Changes: Any variation in specified material must be pre-approved prior to

of at least one-fourth the outside diameter of the pipe. No backfill shall be
placed in the trench for a period of at least 24 hours after the concrete has
been placed. The backfill shall then be completed with selected backfill, had
placed and tamped, to the limits shown on Detail Drawings.
Where concrete arch (Type 2) method is used, the trench shall first be
excavated not less than six inches (6") below the barrel of the pipe bell
(whichever is greater). The trench shall then be brought to grade with
compacted crushed stone, placed the full width of the trench, as excavated,
up to one-half the outside diameter of the pipe. the backfill shall then be
complete with Class "B" concrete placed for the full width of the trench, as
excavated, and to a point at least four inches (4") above the barrel of the pipe
or one-fourth the inside diameter of the pipe (whichever is greater).
b. Class B Bedding: Class B bedding shall be performed by first undercutting
the trench not less than six inches (6") below the barrel of the pipe or a
minimum of two inches (2") below the pipe bell (which is greater). The trench
shall then be brought to grade with compacted crushed stone, the pipe laid to
line and grade and backfilled with compacted crushed stone placed the full
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-23
width of the trench, as excavated, up to one-half the outside diameter of the
pipe. The backfill shall then be completed with selected backfill, hand placed
and tamped, to the limits shown on the Detail Drawings.
c. Class C Bedding: Class C bedding shall be performed by first undercutting
the trench not less than six inches (6") below the barrel of the pipe or a
minimum of two inches (2") below the pipe bell (whichever is greater). The
trench shall then be brought to grade with compacted crushed stone, the pipe
laid out to line and grade and backfill of compacted crushed stone placed and
grade and backfill of compacted crushed stone placed the full width of the
trench, as excavated, up to one-fourth the outside diameter of the pipe. The
backfill shall then be completed with selected backfill, hand placed and
tamped, to the limits shown on the Detail Drawings.
d. Bell Holes: Bell Holes shall be provided in all classes of bedding so as to
relieve pipe bells of all load, but small enough to insure that support is
provided throughout the length of pipe barrel.
e. Crushed Stone Bedding Material: Crushed stone bedding material shall
conform to the latest revision of ASTM C 33, as amended to date, gradation
of #57 (ASTM #57), varying in sizes ¼" through 1". Bedding material shall be
placed in the trench and thoroughly compacted to grade by tamping.
Compacted bedding materials shall be carried up the sides of the pipe to the
heights shown for the various classes of bedding.
f. Excess Trench Widths: If trenches are excavated to widths in excess of
those specified in Table D-5 or if trench walls collapse, pipe shall be laid
down with the class of bedding required for the trench depth shown in column
(2) of Table D-5, at the expense of the Contractor.
2. PVC Pipe: PVC pipe shall be laid as specified using the following classes of
bedding required for the various type soils and conditions encountered. Bedding
for PVC pipe shall be in accordance with ASTM D 2321, as amended to date, the
manufacturers recommendations and these specifications.
a. Bedding Material: Class IA or IB Materials shall be used for bedding and
haunching in all conditions. Class II, Class III, Class IVA, Class IVB and
Class V materials will not be permitted for bedding and haunching under any
condition.
b. Depth of Bedding: Trench shall be undercut to allow for a minimum of six
inches (6") of bedding material. Bell holes shall be excavated in the bedding
material to allow for unobstructed assembly of the joint but care shall be
taken to assure that bell hole is no larger than necessary to accomplish
proper joint assembly. After joint assembly, material shall be placed under
and around the entire length of pipe and compacted. Compaction up to onehalf
the outside diameter of the pipe and the full width of the ditch shall be of
the same material used in the bedding. Backfilling shall then be carried to a
point six inches (6") above the top of pipe, using hand tools for tamping. If
the remaining backfill material contains large particles which could damage
the pipe from impact during placement the initial backfill shall be increased to
twelve inches (12") above the top of the pipe. Puddling will not be allowed as
a method of compaction. The remaining backfill shall be as specified in
"General Backfill" paragraph of these specifications. Pipe shall have at least
thirty six inches (36") inches of cover before wheel loading and at least forty
eight inches (48") of cover before using heavy duty tamping equipment such
as a hydrohammer.

j. Laying Gravity Sewer Pipe: All sewer pipe shall be laid upgrade, spigots shall
point downgrade. The pipe shall be laid in the trench so that, after the sewer is
completed, the invert fixed or given by the Engineer. The interior of all pipes shall be
carefully freed of all dirt and superfluous material of every description, as pipe laying
proceeds. Defective joints discovered after laying shall be repaired and made tight.
Defective pipe shall be removed and proper replacement made.
1. Concrete Pipe with Rubber Gasket Joints: The surfaces of the pipe joints as
well as the rubber gaskets, shall be thoroughly cleaned and wiped free of dust,
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-30
dirt, and other foreign material. After the surfaces have been thoroughly cleaned,
the mating surfaces of the joints and gaskets shall be lubricated with proper type
of lubricant supplied by and applied in accordance with the recommendations of
the pipe manufacturer. The gasketed spigot end of the pipe shall then be
centered on a grade into the bell of the preceding pipe, shoved home, and
properly seated by applying a moderate force with a pry or lever device. Pipe
joints shall have the ability to joint up with relative ease and shall resist backing
out from the seated position so that when the joint is made, it will need no
restraint to keep it tight. Immediately after joining the pipes, the last pipe shall be
brought to final alignment and grade. After each joint is made, the gasket shall
be checked for proper position in its groove. Care shall be taken to prevent
pinching and cutting of the gasket during installation. If the gasket during
installation. If the gasket is out of position, or has been damaged in any way the
pipe shall be removed and re-laid with a new gasket. Every pipe shall be filled
around immediately after being properly placed to prevent the moving of joints.
2. PVC Pipe With Elastomeric Joints: Proper implements, tool and equipment
shall be used for placement of the pipe in the trench to prevent damage. Under
no circumstances may the pipe be dropped into the trench. In subfreezing
temperatures, caution shall be exercised in handling pipe to prevent impact
damage. All pipe shall be carefully examined for cracks, blisters, nicks, gouges,
severe scratches, voids inclusions, and other defects before laying. If any pipe is
discovered to be defective after having being laid, it shall be removed and
replaced with sound material at the expense of the Contractor.
a. Assembly of Gasketed Joint: The assembly of the gasketed joint shall be
performed as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. The elastomeric
gaskets may be supplied separately in cartons or pre-positioned in the bell
joint or coupling at the factory. When gaskets are color-coded, the Contractor
shall consult the pipe manufacturer or his literature for the significance. In all
cases, the gasket, the bell or coupling interior, especially the groove area
(except when the gasket is permanently installed) and the spigot area shall
be cleaned with a rag, brush, or paper towel to remove any dirt or foreign
material before the assembling. The gasket pipe spigot bevel, gasket groove,
and sealing surfaces shall be inspected for damage of deformation. When
gaskets are separate, only gaskets which are designed for and supplied with
the pipe shall be used. They shall be inserted as recommended by the
manufacturer.
Lubricant used shall be supplied by the pipe manufacturer and shall be
applied as specified by the pipe manufacturer.
b. Lubrication: After lubrication, the pipe is ready to be joined. Good
alignment of the pipe is essential for ease of assembly. Align the spigot to
the bell and insert the spigot into the bell until it contacts the gasket uniformly.
Do not swing or "stab" the joint, that is, do not suspend the pipe and swing it
into the bell. The spigot end of the pipe is marked by the manufacturer to
indicate the proper depth of insertion.
If undue resistance to insertion of the pipe end is encountered, or the
reference mark does not position properly, the joint shall be assembled and
the position of the gasket checked. If it is twisted or pushed out of its seat
("fish mouthed"), the Contractor shall inspect components, and repeat the
assembly steps. Both pipe lengths concentric alignments. If the gasket was
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-31
not out of position, the Contractor shall verify proper location of the reference
mark. The reference mark shall be relocated if it is out of position.
c. Field Cut: Field cut pipe to be joined shall be square cut using a hacksaw,
handsaw or power saw with a steel blade or abrasive disc. The pipe shall be
marked around its entire circumference prior to cutting to assure a square
cut. A factory-finished beveled end shall be used as a guide for proper bevel
angle, and depth of bevel plus the distance to the insertion reference mark.
The end may be beveled using a pipe taper. A portable sander or abrasive
disc may be used to bevel the pipe end. Any sharp edged on the leading
edge of the bevel must be rounded off with a pocket knife or a file.
d. Deflection Testing: The maximum deflection in the installed PVC pipeline
shall not exceed 5% of the pipe original internal diameter. Deflection testing
will be required using either a deflect meter or a "GO-NO-GO" mandrel. The
Engineer shall randomly select portions of the project to be deflection tested.
Such portions shall consist of not less than 5% of the total reaches. (Reach
being lengths of pipe between two manholes in the project excluding house
leads).
Where deflection is found to be excess of 5% of the original pipe diameter,
the Contractor shall excavate to the point of excess deflection and carefully
compact around the point where excess deflection was found. The line shall
then be re-tested for deflection. However, line shall then be re-tested for
deflection. However, should after the initial testing the deflection. However,
should after the initial testing the deflected pipe fail to return to the original
size (inside diameter) the line shall be replaced.
In the event that deflection occurs beyond the 5% limit in any section of 5% or
more of the reached tested, the entire system shall be tested.
3. Ductile Iron Pipe With Mechanical or Push-On Joints: Proper and suitable
tools and equipment shall be used for the safe and convenient handling and
laying of ductile iron pipe. Care shall be taken to prevent damage to the exterior
coating and interior cement lining. All pipe shall be carefully examined for crack
and other defects before laying. If any pipe or fitting is discovered to be defective
after having being laid, it shall be removed and replaced with sound material at
the expense of the Contractor. Whenever pipe is required to be cut, the cutting
shall be done by skilled workmen using an abrasive wheel cutter. Use of a cold
chisel or oxyacetylene torch will not be permitted.
a. Mechanical Joints: Mechanical joints shall be made only by experience
mechanics. sockets and spigots shall be washed with soapy water before
slipping the gland and gasket over the spigot end of the pipe.
The spigot shall be inserted into the socket full depth, then backed off ¼ inch
to provide clearance for expansion. The gasket shall be brushed with soapy
water and shall be pushed into position making sure that it is evenly seated in
the socket. The gland shall then be moved into position for compressing the
gasket. All bolts and nuts shall be made "finger-tight."
For joints made in trenches, the bolts shall be tightened to a uniform
tightness, using a torque wrench for tightening. Bolts shall be tightened
alternately 180 degrees apart.
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-32
b. Push-On Joints: The groove and bell socket shall be thoroughly cleaned
and lubricated before the gasket is inserted. Before inserting the gasket it
shall be thoroughly lubricated and manufacturers instructions shall be
followed for proper facing and seating of a gasket. After the gasket is in
place and just prior to joint assembly, a generous coating of lubricant shall be
applied to the exposed gasket surface. The lubricant used shall be a
lubricant supplied by the pipe manufacturer.
The plain end shall be inspected and any sharp edges which might damage
the gasket shall be removed by mean of a file or a power grinder. Pipe that is
cut in the field must be ground and beveled before assembly. Prior to
inserting the plain end of the pipe into the bell socket lubricant shall be
applied to the beveled nose of the pipe.
Small pipe may be pushed home with a long bar but large pipe may require
additional power such as a jack, lever, or back hoe. A timber header shall be
used between the bell and bar or other power to avoid damage to the pipe.
During assembly of the pipe the joint must be kept straight while pushing.
Pipe may be deflected if desired but only after the assembly is complete.
c. Mechanical joint or Push-On Joint Pipe on Piers: Mechanical or Push-on
Joint pipe may be used on piers in gravity sewer lines. Pipes shall be laid
with ¼ inch clearance in each joint to provide for expansion. Jointing of pipe
shall be as described above. On mechanical joint pipe the bolts shall be
tightened alternately 180 degrees apart, but be left "finger-tight" until the
sewage is diverted into the sewers; then the bolts shall be further tightened a
sufficient amount which will prevent slippage which may occur because of
temperature stress.

regulations of the State Highway Department; the Detail Drawings and these
Specifications. All excavation for pit and bore shall be unclassified.
1. Boring Pit: The boring pit shall be solid sheeted, braced and shored as
necessary to provide a safe operation. The Contractor shall take all precautions,
and shall comply with all requirements as may be necessary to protect private or
public property.
2. Line and Grade: The Contractor shall set the boring rig so that, after the casing
is completed and the sewer carrier pipe installed, the invert surface of the sewer
shall conform accurately to the grades and alignment fixed or given by the
Engineer.
3. Boring: The hole shall be bored and cased through the soil by a cutting head on
a continuous auger mounted inside the casing pipe. The boring of the howl and

rods, swabs, or other instruments. Lines and manholes shall be clean before final
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-36
inspection. Pipe lines shall be straight and show a uniform grade between
manholes. The Contractor shall be required to correct any variations therefrom
which may be disclosed during the inspection.
u. Leakage Tests: All sewer lines, including in house service lines, shall be tested for
leakage, in the presence of the Engineer or his representative, before being placed
into service. Tests shall be conducted by one or a combination of the following three
methods:
1. Infiltration Test: Where natural ground water levels stand a minimum of two
feet (2') above the top of the pipe, the amount of leakage may be determined
form measurements made at the lower end of the sewer section under test.
Sewers above the test section shall be closed before testing by the installation of
suitable watertight bulkheads. The length of the test section shall be determined
by the Engineer. The average of six reading at five minute intervals will be used
to determine the rate of infiltration for any one test section.
The rate if infiltration of ground water into any test section of sewer, including
manholes, shall not exceed the following:
TABLE D-10 MAXIMUM RATE OF GROUND WATER INFILTRATION
Size of Sewer Gallons Per 24 Hours Per Foot of Sewer
8" 0.30
10" 0.38
12" 0.45
15" 0.57
18" 0.68
21" 0.80
24" 0.91
30" 1.14
2. Exfiltration Test: Where natural ground water levels do not stand two feet (2')
above the top of the pipe, an exfiltration test shall be conducted on each section
of sewer. The test shall be performed up to an average maximum hydrostatic
head of ten feet (10'). The test shall be conducted in the following manner.
The ends of the pipe in the test section shall be closed with suitable watertight
bulkheads. Inserted into each bulkhead at the top of the sewer pipe shall be a 2-
inch pipe nipple with an elbow. At the upper end of the test section a riser pipe
shall be installed. The test section of the pipe shall be filled through the pipe
connection in the lower bulkhead which shall be fitted with a tight valve, until all
air is exhausted and until water overflows the riser pipe at the upper end. Water
may be introduced into the pipe twenty four (24) hours prior to the test period to
allow complete saturation. House service line, if installed, shall also be fitted with
suitable bulkheads having provisions for the release of air while the test section
is being filled with water.
During the test period, which shall extend over a period of thirty (30) minutes,
water shall be introduced into the riser pipe from measured containers at such
intervals as are necessary to maintain the water at the top of the riser pipe. The
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-37
total volume of water added during the thirty (30) minute test period shall not
exceed that shown for infiltration in (a) above.
3. Low-Pressure Air Test: Where sewer grades are such that preclude
performance of the exfiltration test or at the Contractor's option, a low-pressure
air test shall be conducted on each section of sewer after completion and before
acceptance.
Prior to air testing, the section of sewer between manholes shall be thoroughly
cleaned and wetted. Immediately after cleaning or while the pipe is water
soaked, the sewer shall be tested with low-pressure air. At the Contractor's
option sewers may be tested in lengths between manholes or in short sections
(25 feet or less) using Air-Lock balls pulled through the line from manhole to
manhole. Air shall be slowly supplied to the plugged sewer sections until internal
air pressure reaches approximately 4.0 psi. After this pressure reached and the
pressure allowed to stabilize approximately 2 to 5 minutes), the pressure may be
reduced to 3.5 psi before starting the tests. If a 1.0 psi during the test time the
line is presumed to have failed the test, and the Contractor will be required to
locate the failure, make necessary repairs and re-test the line. Minimum test
time for various pipe sizes, in accordance with ASTM C 828, as amended to
date, is as follows:
TABLE D-11 MINIMUM TEST TIME FOR PIPE SIZES
Nominal Pipe Size (Inches) T(time) Min/100 Feet
8 1.2
10 1.5
12 1.8
15 2.1
18 2.4
24 3.6
30 4.8
Required test equipment includes Air-Lock balls, braces, air hose, air source,
timer, rotometer as applicable, cut-off valves, pressure reducing valve, 0-15
pressure gauge, 0-5 pressure gauge with gradations in 0.1 psi and accuracy of +
2%.
The Contractor shall keep records of all tests made. Copy of such records will be
given to the Engineer or the Owner. Such records shall show date, line number
and stations, operator and such other pertinent information as required by the
Engineer.
The Contractor is cautioned to observe proper safety precautions in performance
of the air testing. It is imperative that plugs be properly secured and that care be
exercised in their removal. Every precaution shall be taken to avoid the
possibility of over pressurizing the sewer line.
4. Repairs: All visible leaks shall be repaired regardless of whether infiltration,
exfiltration or air test is within allowable limits. No sewer will be accepted until
leakage tests demonstrate compliance with one of the above leakage test
methods.
APPENDIX D  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
North Augusta Development Code D-38
v. Manhole Vacuum Test: All new wastewater manholes shall be vacuum tested
according to the following procedure prior to acceptance:
All manholes shall be vacuum tested according to ASTM C1244-93 Standard Test
Methods for Concrete Sewer Manholes by the Negative Pressure (Vacuum) Test
after backfilling operations. The general procedure shall be as follows:
1. Manholes shall be prepared by plugging all lift holes and pipes entering the
manhole. Care should be taken to securely brace all pipes and plugs to prevent
being pulled into the manhole during the test.
2. The test head shall be placed on top of the manhole according to manufacture
specifications and 10 inches of mercury be drawn down on the manhole.
3. The valve on the vacuum line shall be closed and valve pump shut off.
4. The time shall be measure for the vacuum to drop to 9 inches of mercury.
The manhole shall pass if the time required to drop from 10 inches to 9 inches of
mercury exceeds the time listed in the table below. If the drop occurs faster than the
time below the manhole shall be repaired using approved methods and retested until

9.1	PURPOSE STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES
It is  the purpose of this Article to protect human life and health, minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring  that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or  erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains,  stream channels  and natural protective  barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, this Article prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

The objectives of this Article are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such  a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood  area. The provisions of this Article are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities including water and gas mains,  electric  lines, telephone lines, sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain  management  objective  of this Article is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding.

Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions including temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater  recharge,  prevention  of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife  populations,  recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs.

9.2	GENERAL  PROVISIONS


9.2.1	Statutory Authorization
SC Code, Title 5, Articles 7, 23, and 25 (Articles 5 and 7) and Title 6, Article 7, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Note: Definitions of words and terms related to floodplain management and used in this Article are contained in Appendix A to this Chapter and in Section 59.1, Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.)

9.2.2	Finding of Fact
The special flood hazard areas of North Augusta are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, creates health and safety hazards, disrupts commerce and governmental services, creates extraordinary public expenditure requirements for flood protection and relief, and impairs the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and  general welfare. Furthermore, flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights  and  velocities. Flood losses are also caused by occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
 
ORDINANCE AMENDING THE NORTH AUGUSTA DEVELOPMENT CODE

9.2.4	Development Permit Required
A development permit is required in conformance with this Chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities on flood hazard land .

9.2.5	Compliance
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable regulations .

9.2.6	Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this Article all prov1s1ons shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This Article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this Article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the  more  stringent restrictions shall prevail.

9.2.7	Partial Invalidity and Severability
If any part of this Article is declared invalid, the remainder of this Article shall not be affected and shall remain in force.

9.2.8	Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on  scientific  and  engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Article shall not create liability on the part of North Augusta or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

9.4.2	Specific Standards
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in §§9.2.3 or 9.3.4.13, the following provisions are required:

9.4.2.1	Residential Construction - New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with §9.4.2.5.

9.4.2.2	Non-Residential   Construction   New    construction    or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial  or  non-residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with §9.4.2.5. No basements  are permitted. Structures located in "A" Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the Local Administrator as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in §9.3.3.6. A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in §9.6.4 of this Article. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of §9.6.4 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this Article. Structures which are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The maintenance plan must be approved by the Local Administrator and notification  of the  annual  exercise shall be provided to same.

9.4.2.3	Manufactured  Homes -
a.	Manufactured homes  that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or sub-division, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one
(1)	foot above the base flood elevation and must be securely anchored to an
adequately  anchored   foundation  system  to  resist  flotation,  collapse  and lateral movement.
b.	Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured  home park or subdivision that is not subject to
 
ORDINANCE AMENDING THE NORTH AUGUSTA DEVELOPMENT CODE
 
Page 15
 



the provisions of §9.4.2.3.a, must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, and must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
c.	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement in accordance with §40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of  at least equivalent strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
d.	An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas.

9.6.8	Conditions
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this Article, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of  this Article. The following conditions shall apply to all variances:

9.6.8.1	Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure m violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations or ordinances.

9.6.8.2	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the vanance 1s the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,  to  afford relief.

9.6.8.3	Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

9.6.8.4	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest  floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.

9.6.8.5	The Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request.

9.6.8.6    Variances shall not be issued for development initiated without a permit or other development that is not in compliance with this Article. Violations must be corrected in accordance with §9.3.5.5 of this Article.

9.1                  PURPOSE STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES
It is the purpose of this Article to protect human life and health, minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices  to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited . These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters , and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, this Article prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

The objectives of this Article are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions  of this Article  are intended  to minimize  damage to public

facilities and utilities including water and gas mains, electric lines, telephone lines, sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this Article is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding.

Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions including temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs.

9.2	GENERAL PROVISIONS


9.2.1	Statutory Authorization
SC Code; Title 5, Articles 7, 23, and 25 (Articles 5 and 7) and Title 6, Article 7, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Note: Definitions of words and terms related to floodplain management and used in this Article are contained in Appendix A to this Chapter  and  in Section 59.1, Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.)

9.2.2	Finding of Fact
The special flood hazard areas of North Augusta are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, creates health and safety hazards, disrupts commerce and governmental services, creates extraordinary public expenditure requirements for flood protection and relief, and impairs the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Furthermore, flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. Flood losses are also caused by occupancy in flood hazard areas  by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

9.2.3	Applicability
This Article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of North Augusta, South Carolina as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study for Aiken County, dated June 19, 2012 and for Edgefield County dated March 3, 2011 with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted  by reference,  declared to be a part of this  Chapter and adopted in
§3.2.2.
 
ORDINANCE AMENDING THE NORTH AUGUSTA DEVELOPMENT CODE
 
Page 5
 



Upon annexation, any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study for the unincorporated areas of Aiken County and Edgefield County, with accompanying map and other data, are adopted by reference and declared part of this ordinance.

9.2.4	Development Permit Required
A development permit is required in conformance with this Chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities on flood hazard land.

9.2.5	Compliance
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable regulations.

9.2.6	Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this Article all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This Article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this Article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

9.2.7	Partiallnvalidity and Severability
If any part of this Article is declared invalid, the remainder of this Article
shall not be affected and shall remain in force.

9.2.8	Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can  and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Article shall not create liability on the part of North Augusta or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

9.4.1.9	All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent floatation or lateral movement resulting from hydronamic and hydrostatic loads.

9.4.1.10	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure which is in compliance with this Article, shall meet  the requirements of new construction as contained in this Article. This includes post-FIRM development and structures.

9.4.1.11	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 19, Nonconforming Uses, of the North Augusta Development Code, nonconforming buildings may not be enlarged, replaced or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with this Article. Provided, however , nothing in this Article shall prevent the repair, reconstruction or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this Article.

9.4.1.12	Nonconforming uses may not be enlarged, changed to another nonconforming use, or resumed  if abandoned for a continuous period  of six
(6) months.


9.4.1.13	A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in §9.4.2, as well as any applicable requirements of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements . The cost of improvements required to meet ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement.

9.4.2	Specific Standards
In all areas of special flood hazard (Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, V, and VE)  where  base  flood  elevation  data  has  been  provided,  as  set  forth  in
§§9.2.3  or  9.3.3.13  or  outlined   in   §9.3.4,  the  following  provisions   are
required:


9.4.2.1	Residential Construction -New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure, including manufactured  homes, shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.

no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation . Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood  waters shall be provided in accordance with §9.4.2.S. No basements are permitted. Structures located in "A" Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy . A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the Local Floodplain_Administrator as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in §9.3.2.6. A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in §9.6.5 of this Article. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of §9.6.S must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this Article. Structures which are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The maintenance plan must be approved by the Local Floodplain Administrator and notification of the  annual exercise shall be provided to same.

Page 19
 



permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the floodway configuration.

9.4.2.10	Fill - Fill is discouraged because storage capacity is removed from floodplains. Elevating buildings by other methods must be considered. An applicant shall demonstrate that fill is the only alternative to raising the building to at least one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, and that the amount of fill used will not affect the flood storage capacity or adversely affect adjacent properties. The following provisions shall apply to all fill placed in the special flood hazard area:
a.	Fill may not be placed  in the floodway unless it is in accordance with
§9.4.2.9.a;
b.	Fill may not be placed in wetlands without the required state and federal permits;

9.4.3	Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations and Floodways
Located within the areas of special flood hazard (Zones A and V) established in §9.2.3 are small streams where no base flood data has been provided and where no floodways have been identified. The following provisions apply within such areas:

9.4.3.1	In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data are not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates base flood elevations for all subdivision proposals and other proposed  developments greater than two (2) lots or one
(1) acre, whichever is less.

9.4.3.2	No encroachments, including  fill,  new  construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within one hundred  (100) feet of the stream bank unless certification  with  supporting
 



technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

9.4.3.3	If §9.4.3.l is satisfied and base flood elevation data  is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions of §9.4 and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established in accordance with §9.3.4.10. Data from preliminary, draft and fmal  Flood Insurance Studies constitutes best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical Bulletin 1- 98 Use of Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Data as Available Data. If an appeal is pending on a study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used.

9.4.3.4	When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal, state or other source, one of the following methods may be used to determine a BFE. For further information regarding the BFE determination, refer to FEMA's manual Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas:
a.	Contour Interpolation
1)	Superimpose approximate Zone A boundaries onto a topographic map and estimate a BFE;
2)	Add  one-half of the contour interval of the topographic  map that is
used to the BFE.
b.	Data Extrapolation - A BFE can be  determined  if  a site within  five hundred (500) feet upstream  of  a stream  reach  for which  a  100-year profile has been computed by detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope characteristics are  relatively  similar  to  the downstream reaches. No hydraulic structures shall be present.
c.	Hydrologic and Hydraulic Calculations - Perform hydrologic and hydraulic calculations to determine BFEs using FEMA approved methods and software.

9.4.4	Standards for Streams With Established Base Flood Elevations But Without Floodways

9.5.2	Requirement to Submit New Technical Data
For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations  or  base flood elevations, the Local Floodplain Administrator shall ensure  that technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such information becomes available . These development proposals include :
a.	Floodway encroachments  that increase or decrease base flood elevations
or alter floodway boundaries;
b.	Fill sites to be used for the placement  of proposed  structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area;
c.	Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts ; and
d.	Subdivision	or	large	scale	development	proposals	requiring	the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §9.4.3.1.

9.5.2.1	It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data, required in accordance with §9.5, prepared in a format for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall also be the responsibility of the applicant.

9.5.2.2	The Local  Floodplain Administrator shall require a CLOMR prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
a.	Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation; and
b.	Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by more
than  one  (1)  foot  in  areas  where  FEMA  has  provided  base  flood elevations but no floodway.

9.5.2.3	Floodplain development permits issued by the  Local Floodplain Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a LOMR from FEMA for any development proposal subject to §9.5.

9.5.2.4	Conditional Letter of Map Revisions (CLOMR) and/or Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) must go through the variance process outlined in
§9.6.

9.5.3                Right to Submit New Technical Data
The Local Floodplain Administrator may request changes to any of  the information shown on an effective map that does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the local jurisdiction and may be submitted at any time.

 9.6	VARIANCE PROVISIONS 	


9.6.1	Establishment  of Appeal Board
The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the City of North Augusta in Article 18, Administration, of the North Augusta Development Code, shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this Article.

9.6.2	Right to Appeal
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals or any taxpayer may appeal such decision as provided in Article 18, Administration of the North Augusta Development Code and pursuant to S.C. Code §6-29- 820 to the circuit court in and for the counties of Aiken and Edgefield as applicable.

9.6.3	Historic Structures
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

9.6.4	Functionally Dependent Uses
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of §9.6 are met, no reasonable alternatives exist, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage and create no additional threat to public safety.

9.6.5	Agricultural Structures
Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure provided it is used solely for agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure must meet all of the conditions and considerations of §9.6.8, this section, and the following standards:

 
9.6.5.1
listed below:
 
Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as
 
a.	Pole  frame buildings with open or closed sides used  exclusively  for the storage of farm machinery and equipment;

9.6.6.4	The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

 
9.6.6.5
applicable;
 
The necessity  to the facility of a waterfront  location, where
 

9.6.6.6	The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;

9.6.6.7	The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and  the relationship of  the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9.6.6.8	The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

9.6.6.9	The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.

9.6.6.10	Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the Special Flood Hazard Area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available.

9.6.7	Findings
Findings listed above shall be submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals, in writing, and included in the application for a variance. Additionally, comments from the SC Department of Natural  Resources Land, Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator's Office, must be taken into account and included in the permit file.

9.6.8	Floodways
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increases in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to the issuance of the variance. In order to insure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which a variance is granted, the
 
ORDINANCE AMENDING THE NORTH AUGUSTA DEVELOPMENT CODE
 
Page 26
 



applicant must provide a performance guarantee and letter of credit for one hundred twenty.five percent (125%) of the cost to perform the development. The performance guarantee and letter of credit shall be valid for a period equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the estimated time required to complete construction of the development.

9.6.9	Conditions
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this Article, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Article. The following conditions shall apply to all variances:

9.6.9.1	Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations or ordinances.

9.6.9.2	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

9.6.9.3	Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

9.6.9.4	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.

9.6.9.S	The Local Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request.

9.6.9.6  Variances   shall   not   be   issued   for  development   initiated without a permit or other development that is not in compliance with this Article. Violations must be corrected in accordance with §9.3.5.5 of this Article.

9.7	LEGAL STATUS


9.7.1	Effect on Rights and Liabilities under the Existing Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance
This Article in part comes forward by re-enactment of some of the provisions
of the Flood  Damage  Prevention  Ordinance  enacted  on July  15, 1980, as
 
ORDINANCE AMENDING THE NORTH AUGUSTA DEVELOPMENT CODE
 
Page 27
 



amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue to enforce without interruption of such existing provisions, so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are reserved and may be enforced. The enactment of this Article shall not affect any action, suit or proceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of North Augusta enacted on July 15, 1980, as amended, which are not reenacted herein are repealed.

9.7.2	Effect upon Outstanding Building Permits
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size or designated use of any building, structure or part thereof for which a building permit has been granted by the Building Official or his authorized agents before the time of passage of this Article; provided, however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding permit within a period of sixty (60) days subsequent to passage of this Article, construction or use shall be in conformity with this Article.

9.7.3	Effective Date
This Article shall become effective upon adoption.

C.	Appendix A, Definitions is amended to modify the following existing definitions:

Accessory Structure
For purposes of Article 9, a structure which is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Detached garages,  carports  and  storage sheds are common urban accessory structures. Pole barns, hay sheds and the like qualify as accessory structures on farms, and may or may not be located on the same parcel as the farm dwelling or shop building.

Appeal
For purposes of Article 9, a request for a review of the Local Floodplain Administrator's interpretation of any provision of this Chapter.

Existing Construction
For purposes of Article 9 "existing structure" means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before June 3, 1977.

Existing Manufactured  Home Park or Manufactured  Home Subdivision For  purposes  of Article  9,  a manufactured  home  park  or  subdivision  for which  the  construction  of  facilities  for  servicing  the  lots  on  which  the manufactured   homes   are  to  be  affixed  (including,  at  a  minimum,  the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) was completed before April 20, 1987.
