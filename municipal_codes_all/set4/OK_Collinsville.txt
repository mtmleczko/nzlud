PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Collinsville, Oklahoma. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2000 Code, as supplemented through July 6, 2008, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2000 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Lisa Stevens, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Pam Polk, City Manager, and Angela Long, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Charter of the City of Collinsville, Oklahoma, duly adopted by vote of the town electors on the November 24, 1913. Many provisions of the 1913 Charter have been superseded by subsequent amendments to general law. The user is directed to the corresponding provisions within the following Code of Ordinances for the implementation of the city's charter authority as modified by current state statutes. Amendments to the Charter by subsequent referanda are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform where possible and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated brackets. Although Collinsville is currently situated in two Oklahoma counties, Rogers and Tulsa, references in this Charter to Rogers County individually have been left unchanged from the original. References to the Tulsa County court, governing authority and county officials are construed to mean the governing authority, court and officials of that county only and are unchanged from the original. 
State Law reference- Municipal charters generally, 11 O.S. § 13-101 et seq.; Home Rule Charter Act, 19 O.S. § 8.1 et seq.; provisions of charter prevail over general law, 11 O.S. § 13-109.

ARTICLE XV. - PUBLIC UTILITIES 
    SECTION 1. No street, alley, or public highway in the City of Collinsville shall ever be used by any person, firm or corporation for the construction or operation of a street railway, telegraph line, telephone system, or any other business of a public or quasi public nature, without obtaining authority therefor under a franchise granted by the board of commissioners, in accordance with the provisions of this Charter. It shall be the duty of the board of commissioners and the city attorney to bring suit to enforce this provision against any person, firm or corporation violating the terms thereof, for the purpose of ejecting the offender from the occupancy of such property, and to recover damages for the illegal use thereof. 
    SECTION 2. The board of commissioners shall have power, by ordinance, to provide for and construct a general sewer and drainage system, to be divided into public and private sewers and drains, and to be constructed, maintained and regulated in such manner and out of such material as the board of commissioners may prescribe. Sewers may be established as the board of commissioners may direct, and there may be extension of branches of sewers already constructed or entirely new throughout as may be deemed expedient. The board of commissioners may, if necessary, levy a tax on all taxable property in the entire city, to pay for the construction and repairs of such public sewers which shall be called a "special sewer tax," and shall be used solely for such purpose. No public sewer shall be run diagonally through private property when it is practicable, without injury to said sewer, to construct it parallel with one of the exterior lines of such property. No public sewer shall be constructed through private property when it is practicable to construct it along or through a street or public highway. 
    SECTION 3. The board of commissioners shall have the power to appropriate private property for public purposes, whenever the board of commissioners of said city shall deem it necessary to take any private property either within or without the city limits for any of the following purposes, to-wit: 
    In order to open, extend, change or widen any public street, avenue or alley or for the construction of water mains or sewers, either within or without the city limits, or for the improvement and enlargement of its waterworks, including riparian rights, watersheds, reservoirs, etc., parks, squares and pleasure grounds, or for the straightening or improving of the channel of any stream, branch or drain, such property may be taken for such purposes by making just compensation to the owner thereof. If the amount of such compensation shall not be agreed upon, it shall be the duty of the board of commissioners to cause to be stated in writing the real estate or property sought to be taken, the name of the owners hereof, and his residence if known, and the purpose for which said property is sought to be taken, and file such statement with the judge of the district court of Rogers County. Upon the filing of such statement, it shall be the duty of such judge, in term time or vacation, to appoint three disinterested freeholders and qualified voters of the City of Collinsville as special commissioners to assess the damages to accrue to the owners by reason of such condemnation. The special commissioners so appointed, shall, in their proceedings, be governed and controlled by the state laws in force in reference to the condemnation or right-of-way for railroad companies, and the assessment of damages therefor, the City of Collinsville occupying the position of the railroad company. In estimating the damages to such property the jury shall not only estimate the value of the land so taken but shall also estimate the damage done to the remainder of any land from which it is taken by reason of such taking and use; provided, however, that in case of the condemnation of land for the opening, extending or widening of any street, or for straightening or improving the channel of any stream, branch or drain within the corporate limits of said city, the board of commissioners may, by ordinance, provide that the cost of such property shall be paid by the property owners owning property in the immediate vicinity thereof and benefited thereby. In such cases the city engineer, or other person designated by the board of commissioners shall, under the direction of the special commissioners appointed, make a plat of the property which in the judgment of said special commissioners will be specifically benefited and enhanced in value by the making of such improvement, whereupon such special commissioners shall issue notice to the owners of such property to appear before them at a time and place to be designated in such notices to show cause, if any they have, why such property should not be assessed to pay the cost of the property so condemned. Such notices may be served by any police officer in the City of Collinsville, or any other officer of the State of Oklahoma, County of Rogers authorized by the laws of said state to serve process of the courts of said state; and in all cases where such owner or owners, or any of them, are absent from said city and county, upon the agent of such absent owner, if such owner shall have an agent in said city or county, and in case such absent owner shall not have such agent, or in case the owner of such property is unknown, then such notice shall be published for two days consecutively in some daily newspaper or once in a weekly newspaper, published in the City of Collinsville; such notice shall be given five full days before the final determination by the special commissioners of the amount of assessment against the owners of such property for such improvement; said special commissioners shall determine the value of the property desired to be taken, belonging to the different owners thereof, if there be more than one such owner, and if there be only one such owner, the value of the same, and shall also find how much of the cost thereof shall be assessed against the owner of each lot or subdivision of the land in the immediate vicinity thereof specially benefited and enhanced in value by the making of such improvement and shall report all said matters to the board of commissioners of the City of Collinsville, showing a description of the property taken and condemned and the name of the owner thereof, if known, and if the owner of any such property is unknown, shall state said fact; or if there be more than one owner of such property, then the description of the property of each said owner, if known, and if unknown, shall state such fact; and the value of the property of each such owner so condemned, and also the description and name of the owner of each subdivision of property if known, and, if unknown shall so state; describing such property so as to identify it against which special assessment should in the judgment of said board be made to pay for such property condemned, such apportionment shall be made according to the benefits that will, in the judgment of said special commissioners, be received by or accrue to such lot or subdivision of property by reason of the making of such improvements; and such report shall be filed with the business manager for the consideration of the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners shall, as soon as practicable after the filing of such report, consider the same, and if the same is approved by a majority vote of the members present at the meeting at which it considers the same, the same shall be final and binding upon the city and all parties at interest therein. If the board of commissioners shall approve said report, it shall levy a special tax against the property shown by said report to be benefited and enhanced in value by such improvement, according to the recommendation made in such report; such taxes shall be a lien on the property against which the same shall be assessed, from the date of such levy, and shall become due and delinquent at the times provided in the ordinance levying the same. If the same shall not be paid as provided in such ordinance, the board of commissioners shall proceed to collect same, as provided in the ordinance, levying same by the advertisement and sale as provided in the city Charter in cases of the sale of such property for delinquent ad valorem taxes; provided, that it shall not be necessary to make such sales at the same time as provided for in the sale of property for delinquent ad valorem taxes. The special commissioners appointed under the provisions of this section shall have the same power to issue writs and subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses, etc., as commissioners appointed for the condemnation of land, etc., for the right-of-way of railroads under the general laws of the State of Oklahoma, shall receive the same compensation for their services, and shall be governed in all respects not herein otherwise provided by general laws in all matters relating to their procedure. The compensation for the land and property taken or damaged under the provisions of this section shall be paid to the owner of such property so taken or damaged, or secured by a deposit set apart in money in the hands of the city treasurer, subject to the order of such owner, before such property is taken or damaged; provided, the city may make such payment out of the general fund, if the board of commissioners shall deem it advisable, and when the amounts assessed against the property specially benefited as is herein provided are collected, may repay to said general fund the amount so advanced, and such payment shall not be a waiver of the city's rights to make such collection. 
    SECTION 4. The board of commissioners shall have power to cause telegraph, telephone and electric light companies to change the location of their poles; also to cause all erected poles not in use to be taken down and removed. If such companies shall fail to do such things after being notified, the city may have the same done at the expense of such companies. The board of commissioners shall also have the power to require telegraph, telephone companies and electric light companies to run their wires under the ground, if, in the wisdom of the board, public interest should so demand. 
    SECTION 5. Any person, firm or corporation holding any franchise heretofore or hereafter granted by the city, authorizing the use or occupation for any purpose of any street, avenue or alley in the city, or any portion thereof, and requiring or binding the person, firm or corporation holding such franchise to keep any portion of such street, avenue or alley so used or occupied, or the pavement thereof in repair, or to maintain the same in condition for public travel; or any person, firm or corporation who, under any contract heretofore or hereafter made with the city for the construction, reconstruction or repair of the pavement or other improvement of any avenue, street, or alley, or any portion thereof, shall be or is bound to keep the same in repair or in good condition for public travel, or to do or to perform any duty relating to the maintenance or repair of such pavement or other improvement, for any term of years mentioned in such contract, who shall be served with a written notice signed by any owner or owners of property abutting such street, avenue or alley, or such portion thereof, such notice to be served by delivering in person or by mailing same by registered mail to such person, firm or corporation, or any officer or agent thereof, at the post office address of his residence, and who shall fail or refuse to repair or place in condition for travel according to the terms or requirements of such franchise or contract the portion of such avenue, street or alley mentioned in such notice which such person, firm or corporation is bound to repair or maintain, within 90 days after the date of the service of such notice, shall forfeit to the city the sum of $50.00 for each day after the expiration of said 90 days until said avenue, street or alley or portion thereof mentioned in said notice, and which such person, firm or corporation is bound to repair or maintain, is repaired and put in good condition for public travel, as required by the terms of such franchise or contract, or until the requirements and terms of such contract are complied with, such sum or sums to be recoverable as the suit of the city or at the suit of any owner of property abutting on said avenue, street, or alley, or portion thereof, to the use of the city, in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    SECTION 6. Whenever any franchise to any person, firm or corporation has heretofore been made, or shall hereafter be made or granted by the board of commissioners for the use of any street of the city for the purpose or for the exercise of any public privilege or advantage, and said grant has been or shall hereafter be made upon any conditions named in said grant or things to be performed by said grantee, and such grant shall contain no condition of forfeiture, yet the breach of any condition so named in any such grant, or any failure on the part of said grantee to promptly pay any tax whatever assessed by the city, shall be or cause a forfeiture of said franchise or privilege so granted, as if expressly stipulated for therein and whenever any such grant has been or shall hereafter be made in consideration of the payment of any bonus, said payment shall be secured by a prior lien on all property of said grantee, within the city, whether expressly stipulated for or not and any failure to properly pay such bonus according to the terms of the grant, or any failure to properly pay such bonus according to the terms of the grant, or any failure to pay any tax of any kind, shall be a cause of forfeiture of the franchise or privilege granted, whether such forfeiture be expressly provided for or not.

If any portion of the abutting property shall not be platted into lots or blocks the board of commissioners shall include such ground in proper quarter block districts, for the purpose of appraisement and assessment as herein provided; rovided that in no event shall such costs be assessed against such owners or their property, or liability therefor, finally determined, until after the hearing herein provided for and after the adjustment of equities between such owners; and provided, further, that the costs assessed against any property shall be in proportion to the frontage of the property of each owner to the whole frontage of property in such quarter block so ordered to be improved; provided, that if the application of this rule would, in the opinion of the board, in particular cases, be unjust or unequal it shall be the duty of the board to assess and apportion said costs in such proportion as it may deem just and equitable, having in view the special benefits in enhanced value to be received by each owner of such property, and the equities of such owners and the adjustment of such apportionment so as to produce a substantial equality of benefits received by, and burdens imposed upon each owner. The board shall also have power to provide that the proportion of said costs which may be assessed against said owners and their property shall bear interest at a definite rate, not to exceed seven percent per annum, when the payment thereof is deferred, and shall have the power to include in any assessment which may be made against such owners and their property, reasonable costs of collection, where such costs are incurred and reasonable attorney's fees, where attorney's fees are incurred. 
    SECTION 7.

Such statement shall be submitted to the board which shall examine the same and correct any errors which may appear therein; but no error, omission or mistake in such statement shall in any manner invalidate any assessment made, or lien or claim fixed thereunder. When such statement has been examined and approved by the board and it shall have determined to assess the costs of such improvements against such property, it shall so declare by resolution, directing notices thereof to be given to the owners aforesaid by publication for five consecutive days in a daily newspaper or twice in any other paper of general circulation in the City of Collinsville and also to mail to such owners a copy of such notice by registered letter deposited in the post office in the City of Collinsville, directed to the address of such owner, if known, or if such address be not known then to the agent or attorney of such person, if known, provided that the registered letter aforesaid shall be deposited in such post office in the City of Collinsville within ten days prior to the date set for the hearing hereinafter provided for; and provided further, that the method herein prescribed for service of notice by registered letter shall be merely cumulative of the service of notice of notice by publication above mentioned; and provided, that in all cases where personal service by registered letter shall not be obtained, said service by publication shall nevertheless be deemed valid and binding. The certificate of the business manager, or such other officer as shall be designated by the board, to the effect that the address of such owner or owners or their agent or attorney is unknown to him, and personal service cannot be had upon them shall be deemed conclusive of such fact. The notice aforesaid shall state the time of the hearing hereinafter provided for the general character of the improvements determined upon by the board, the street or part thereof to be improved and the proportionate part and amount per front foot of the total cost of the proposed improvement, which it is contemplated shall be assessed against the property and the owners thereof abutting upon such street or alley to be improved. On the date stated in the notice aforesaid or any time thereafter, before any special assessment is actually levied, any person, firm or corporation, interested in any property which is claimed to be subject to assessment for the purpose of paying the cost of any improvement, in whole or in part, shall be entitled to a full and fair hearing before said board as to all matters affecting such property, or the benefit thereto, of such improvements or any claim of liability or objection [to] the making of such improvements or any invalidity or irregularity in any of the proceedings in reference to making such improvements or any other objection thereto. Such person, firm or corporation shall file their objections in writing and thereafter the board of commissioners shall hear and determine the same, and full opportunity shall be given to the persons, firms or corporations filing such objections to produce evidence, subpoena witnesses and to appear in person or by attorney, and a full and fair hearing thereof shall be given by said board, which hearing may be adjourned from time to time without further notice, and the board of commissioners shall have full power to inquire into and determine the facts necessary to the adjudication of such objects and the ascertainment of special benefits to which such owners by means of such improvements, and shall make such order in each case as may be just and proper. Any objections to the regularity of proceedings with reference to the making of such improvements as herein provided or to the validity of any assessment against said property or the owners thereof shall be deemed waived, unless presented at the time and in the manner herein specified. The time as set for such hearing shall be not less than ten days from the time of the first publication of such notice. When the hearing above mentioned has been concluded, the board shall, by ordinance, assess against the several owners of property, and against their property abutting upon the public street or alley or part thereof ordered to be improved, such proportionate part of the costs of said improvement as by such board may have been adjudged against such respective owners and their property. Said ordinance shall fix a lien upon such property for the respective amount to be assessed, and shall state the time and manner of payment of such assessment, and said board may order that said assessment shall be payable in installments, and prescribe the amount, time and manner of payment of such installment, which however, except as hereinafter provided, shall not exceed ten years, and the payments shall not be deferred beyond ten years from the completion of said improvement, and its acceptance by the city. Said ordinance shall also prescribe the rate of interest to be charged upon deferred payments, not exceeding seven percent per annum and may provide for the maturity of all deferred payments, and their collection, upon default in the payment of any installment of principal or interest. Each property owner, his heirs, assigns or successors, however, shall have the privilege of discharging the whole amount assessed against him or any installment thereof, at any time before maturity, upon payment thereof with accrued interest. Upon the payment by any property owner of his assessment in full, the city shall cause to be executed by its business manager and duly acknowledged for record a release of the lien of such assessment. 
    SECTION 8. When the board shall have reason to believe that the owner or owners of any property may successfully claim the same as exempt from special assessment, it may order that the improvement shall not be made in front of or abutting on such property, unless the owner or owners shall first make a satisfactory provision for the payment of the amount of the cost which would be assessed against such property, except for such exemption, and such contractor shall not be obliged to make such improvement in front of any property which is exempt from the enforcement of a lien for such improvement, but may omit the construction thereof in front of such property. Subject to the provisions hereof the board may, when deemed just and proper, order improvement to be made on only one side of the public street or alley or section or portion thereof, and may assess the cost of, or a portion thereof, against the property and the owner of property abutting on such side of such street or alley or section or portion thereof. 
    SECTION 9. Whenever any error or mistake shall occur in any proceedings provided for in this Charter, it shall be the duty of the board to correct the same, and whenever it shall have been finally determined in any suit that any assessment against any property or its owner or lien against such property fixed or attempted to be fixed under the terms hereof, is for any reason, invalid, unlawful, or not enforcible, then it shall be the duty of the board to at once proceed to reassess against such property such proportion of the costs of making such improvements as shall be proper, lawful and just and fix a lien against such property; and such board shall have power, and it shall be its duty, by ordinance or resolution, to adopt such rules and regulations, and to make such orders as shall, in compliance with the law, provide for correcting such mistakes and making a valid reassessment against such property and fix a valid lien thereon; said board shall have power and it shall be its duty to adopt such rules and regulations for a hearing to the owners of such property before such reassessment which may be necessary or proper, in order to legally bind such owners and their property, by such reassessment; and shall have power to adopt all other rules and regulations which may be requisite to a valid reassessment of such property. Subject to the provisions of this Charter the cost of any such improvement or improvements, after deducting the proportion of such costs as may be assessed against any railroad or street railroad and property abutting upon the street or alley or section or portion thereof ordered to be improved and against the owners of such property, shall be borne and paid by the city. 
    SECTION 10. In addition to the power hereby conferred upon the board, by majority vote, to order the construction of any street improvement or improvements as herein defined, and to assess the costs thereof in whole or in part against the abutting property; whenever the owners of two-thirds of the front feet of property abutting upon any street, avenue or alley, or section or part thereof, shall in writing petition for the improvement thereof, and shall in such petition agree to pay three-fourths of the costs of such improvements in front of their respective property and of improving intersections of streets and alleys, exclusive of such cost as is payable under the terms hereof, by railroads or street railroads, shall generally designate the nature of the proposed improvements, and said board shall order the construction of such improvements; provided, only, that before a resolution ordering said improvement shall be passed by the board, it shall be satisfied from said petition or other evidence as shall be submitted to it, that, exclusive of the costs of said railroad or street railroad at least three-fourths of the whole cost of said improvement can be secured by a valid assessment against property abutting upon the street, or alley, or section, or part thereof, to be improved, or will otherwise be satisfactorily secured.

When such sidewalk is ordered to be constructed, reconstructed or repaired in front of the property of one owner subject to the terms hereof the cost of such sidewalk shall be assessed against the property and the owner thereof. Where sidewalks are ordered to be constructed, reconstructed or repaired in front of the property of more than one owner or in front of more than one lot along any street, avenue, public place, alley or square, or part or portion thereof, the costs of construction, reconstruction or repair of said sidewalk in front of the property of each owner shall be assessed against such owner and his property separately and a separate liability against such owner declared. No assessment for the costs of such sidewalks shall be made against any property or its owner until the board shall have first declared, by resolution, directing notice thereof to be given to the owner or owners of such property. Such notice shall be given by advertising the same in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Collinsville [for] three consecutive days, or once in a weekly newspaper, and also by mailing to said owner or owners a copy of such notice by registered letter deposited in the post office in the City of Collinsville directed to the address of such owner, if known, or if the address be not known, then to the agent or attorney of such owner or owners, if known; provided, that the letters aforesaid shall be deposited in the post office not less than five days prior to the date stated for the hearing hereinafter mentioned, and provided, further, that the method herein prescribed for service of notice by registered letter shall be merely cumulative of notice of publication above mentioned; provided, that in all cases where personal service of notice shall not be obtained the notice by publication shall be valid and binding.

Such objection shall be filed in writing, stating the nature thereof, and full opportunity shall be given to the person or corporation filing the same to produce evidence, subpoena witnesses and to appear in person or by attorney, and a full and fair hearing thereof shall be given by the board, which hearing may be adjourned from time to time without further notice.

Any objection to the regularity of the proceedings with reference to the construction, reconstruction or repairing of such sidewalks or to the validity of any assessment or the determining of liability against such property or its owner shall be deemed waived, unless presented at the time and in the manner herein specified. When the hearing above mentioned has been concluded the board shall, by ordinance, assess against the owner or owners of the property and against their property abutting upon the sidewalk so constructed, reconstructed or repaired the cost of constructing, reconstructing, or repairing such sidewalks in front of or along the property of each owner, and declare a personal liability against such owner or owners thereof. If it shall have been determined by the board upon such hearing that such owner or owners and their property have been benefited in enhanced value of such property in any amount at least equal to such cost; but, if in any case it shall have been determined upon such hearing that the property of any owner is not benefited in enhanced value by such construction, reconstruction, or repair of such sidewalk, then no assessment shall be made against the property of such owner; but if after such hearing it shall be determined by such board that such property has been benefited in enhanced value in any amount less than the cost of the construction, reconstruction, or repairing thereof, then the board shall assess against said owner and his property only such amount as shall equal the benefit received by such owner and his property. The ordinance making said assessment shall fix a lien upon the property of each owner or owners and declare the owner or owners thereof to be personally liable for the respective amounts which may be against them assessed, and shall state the time at which said assessment shall be paid, which shall not be longer than 60 days from the date of making the same. Such assessment shall bear interest from the date of making the same until paid at a rate not to exceed eight percent per annum. The amount assessed under the terms hereof against any property or the property owner thereof shall be secured by a lien upon such property and shall constitute a personal liability against the owner or owners thereof in favor of the City of Collinsville and said liability and lien may be enforced either by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction or by sale of such property of such owner or owners in the manner provided in this Charter for the sale of property for other taxes. Such assessment shall include all costs and expenses, of collection of same where such costs are incurred, including reasonable attorney's fees, where such attorney's fees are incurred.

DIVISION 4. - SALE OF SURPLUS REAL ESTATE 

Sec. 2-440. - Sale or other disposition of surplus real estate. 
    The City Commission of the City of Collinsville declares that it is in the public interest for real estate owned by the city to be returned to the tax rolls if not needed for some present or future municipal use and if it can be sold, traded or otherwise disposed of for a reasonable return. It is therefore the policy of the city to dispose of all real property in which such disposition would afford the city a reasonable return equal to or greater than the appraised value. "Surplus property" means both real estate for which the city has no current or future need as well as property which, if disposed of, would be put to a higher or better use for the community at large. Unless otherwise authorized by a special process by the city commission, real estate declared surplus may be disposed of for a reasonable return by sealed bid, auction, negotiated sale or exchange. In cases where the public interest in a reasonable return is outweighed by the public benefit due to the unique character, location or development potential of any given real estate, the city commission may designate such property for disposal by special disposition process, including disposal at less than appraised value by the options set forth above or by lease purchase, option to purchase or other commonly used commercially reasonable means of disposal. 
(Ord. No. 855, § 1, 8-15-2011) 
Sec. 2-441. - Declaration of surplus real estate. 
    Before any real estate owned by the City of Collinsville may be sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of, it must be declared to be "surplus property." This determination must be made by the city commission by resolution or motion at any regular or special meeting of the commission. In determining whether or not real estate constitutes "surplus property," the commission shall consider the existing use of the property, if any, the potential for future use of the property, the history of the property, the location of the property, the aesthetic value of the property and any other factors which might impact on the public use or benefit from the property. Upon motion or resolution made and passed by a majority of the city commission, the real estate in question may be declared to be surplus real estate. 
(Ord. No. 855, § 1, 8-15-2011) 
Sec. 2-442. - The appraisal of surplus real estate. 
    The city shall have the real estate in question appraised by a qualified real estate appraiser who shall provide to the city a written appraisal reflecting the fair market value of the property. In the event of an exchange or trade of property, the city shall also have a written appraisal made of any properties which might be considered for exchange or trade for the surplus property. 
(Ord. No. 855, § 1, 8-15-2011) 
Sec. 2-443. - The procedure for the sale, exchange or disposition of surplus real estate. 
    Upon declaration by the city commission that the real estate in question constitutes surplus property and upon the completion of the required written appraisals, the city manager shall advertise and sell the surplus real estate by sealed bid, auction or negotiated sale after advertising the property in a local newspaper once each week for a minimum of two weeks and by notice of sale published in three public places, one of which will be city hall. The sale, disposition or exchange of the property will be upon terms and conditions set by the city manager to generate the best possible return for the city. In no event shall the property be sold, exchanged or disposed of for an amount of compensation or property which is less than the appraised value of the surplus property unless the city commission passes a resolution or motion concluding that there is a special need to dispose of the surplus property for less than the appraised value. 
(Ord. No. 855, § 1, 8-15-2011) 
Sec. 2-444. - Confirmation and approval of sale, exchange or disposition of surplus property. 
    Any sale, exchange or disposition of surplus property shall be subject to the final approval of the city commission which shall occur at a regular or special meeting. The sale of the property as negotiated by the city manager shall be confirmed by the city commission if the sale is regular in all respects and generates a return of money or property in an amount equal to or more than the appraised value of the surplus property, provided that the commission may approve the sale for an amount of less than the appraised value if it is determined that the public interest and benefit of disposing of the surplus property outweigh the benefit of selling the property for an amount equal to or more than the appraised value.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 20-19. - Statuatory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has in 82 O.S. §§ 1601-1618 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt ordinances designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city ordains this article. 
(Ord. No. 835, art. I, § A, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 20-20. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 835, art. I, § B, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 20-21. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 835, art. I, § C, 7-20-2009)

    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation means the elevation in feet above mean sea level of the base flood or one percent chance flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    BFE means base flood elevation. 
    CFR means Code of Federal Regulations.

    Development permit means a permit issued by the city floodplain administrator which authorizes development in a special flood hazard area in accordance with this article. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building built, in the case of a building in zones AE, A and X, to have the top of the elevated floor adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones AE, A and X, the term "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. The term "existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the city. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within the city subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. (See definition of Flood. )

The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. A floodway is located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-25. A floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of 44 CFR 60.3. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on the city's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the city board of commissioners and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city board of commissioners. 
    OWRB means the Oklahoma Water Resources Board. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction, for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. 
(1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
(2)  The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance means a grant of relief by the city board of commissioners to a person from the terms of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. (For full requirements see 44 CFR 60.6.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
(Ord. No. 835, art. II, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 20-23. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods:

b.  Satisfies the pertinent provisions of this section. Provided, however, no variance shall be granted where the effect of the variance will be to permit the continuance of a condition which unreasonably creates flooding hazards. 
(2)  Any variance so granted shall not be construed as to relieve any person who receives it from any liability imposed by the Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act or by other laws of the state. 
(3)  In no case shall variances be effective for a period longer than 20 years. 
(4)  Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the board of commissioners, accompanied by a filing fee of $25.00. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 20-51(b) and provisions of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(6)  Any person seeking a variance to build a structure below the base flood elevation will be issued a notice signed by the chairman of the board of commissioners which states that: 
a.  The cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than the base flood elevation; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. 
(7)  At such time as the board of commissioners deems the petition ready for notification to the public, the board of commissioners shall schedule a hearing and direct the applicant to publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in Tulsa County at least 30 days prior to the hearing. 
(8)  The board of commissioners shall conduct the hearing and make determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section. The board of commissioners shall exercise wide discretion in weighing the equities involved and the advantages and disadvantages to the applicant and to the public at large when determining whether the variance shall be granted. 
(9)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances; and 
d.  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(10)  Upon consideration of the factors stated in this section and the intent of this article, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives stated in section 20-21. 
(11)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and a copy of any variance issued by the board of commissioners shall be sent by the floodplain administrator to the OWRB and FEMA within 15 days after issuance of the variance. 
(b)  Special provisions. 
(1)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this article. 
(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
a.  The criteria of subsections (a)(5) and (9) and (b)(2) and (3) of this section are met; and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS OF FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 20-78. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 835, art. V, § A, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 20-79. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevations have been provided or are otherwise determined as set forth in section 20-25, 20-50(8), or 20-80(a), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection is satisfied. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on the Tulsa County FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage and have the bottom of the I-beam elevated at least 36 inches above grade or at least at or above the base flood elevation. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. The home shall be installed by a licensed installer according to state law and compliance herewith shall be certified in writing to the floodplain administrator by said installer prior to habitation of the manufactured home. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zone AE on the Tulsa County FIRM on sites: 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood; 
be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the bottom of the I-beam for the manufactured home is elevated at least one feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. A licensed installer shall install the home in accordance with state law and compliance herewith shall be certified in writing to the floodplain administrator by said installer prior to habitation of the manufactured home. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zone AE on the Tulsa County FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4)b.4 of this section be elevated so that the bottom of the I-beam of the manufactured home is at least one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. A licensed installer shall install the home in accordance with state law and compliance herewith shall be certified in writing to the floodplain administrator by said installer prior to habitation of the manufactured home. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A and AE on the Tulsa County FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of section 20-51, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (4) of this section.

(1)  Encroachments, including but not limited to fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development are prohibited within the adopted floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(3)  The city may permit encroachments within the adopted floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the applicant for the development permit complies with all of 44 CFR 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 835, art. V, § D, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 20-82. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate or other certifications required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. Violation of the provisions of this article by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the board of commissioners or the city attorney from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

Sec. 34-125. - Summary abatement of nuisances. 
(a)  Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and immediate danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more persons or of the public generally. It is recognized that circumstances may be such as to justify, and even to require the mayor or other appropriate officer or agency of the city government to take immediate and proper action summarily to abate such nuisances, or to reduce or suspend the danger until more deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement. 
(b)  The chief of the fire and rescue department, the chief of police, the city attorney, the building official, the electrical inspector, the plumbing inspector, or any other officer subordinate to the mayor may submit through or with the consent of the mayor to the board of commissioners, a statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city or law, and a request or recommendation that it be abated. The mayor himself, the health officer, any commissioner, or any resident or residents of the city may submit such a statement and request a recommendation to the board of commissioners. 
(c)  The board of commissioners shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the board of commissioners shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated, the board of commissioners shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible for or to be causing the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the names or addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of the person or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation within the city. 
(d)  If the board of commissioners finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the person or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate it within the specified time, the board of commissioners shall direct the mayor to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as authorized by 50 O.S. § 16. The city clerk shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names and addresses are known. Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the city collectible as other debts of the city may be collected.

(iv)  Amounts billed to Cable Services subscribers to recover taxes, fees or surcharges imposed upon Cable Services subscribers in connection with the provision of Cable Services, other than the Franchise Fee authorized by this section; 
(v)  Revenue from the sale of capital assets or surplus equipment; or 
(vi)  Charges, other than those described in subsection (1)[(A)(1), above], that are aggregated or bundled with amounts billed to Cable Services subscribers. 
(3)  "Gross Revenues" which are subject to the Franchise Fee paid by Cox additionally include a pro rata portion of all revenue collected by Cox pursuant to compensation arrangements for advertising (less any commissions Cox receives from any third parties for advertising) and home-shopping sales derived from the operation of Cox's Cable System within the City. Advertising commissions paid to third parties (excluding any refunds, rebates, or discounts the Company may make to advertisers) shall not be deducted from advertising revenue included in gross revenue. The allocation of advertising and home-shopping revenue referred to above shall be based on the number of subscribers in the City divided by the total number of subscribers in relation to the relevant regional or national compensation arrangement. 
(4)  Bundling discounts shall be apportioned fairly among video and other services. Cox shall not apportion revenue in such a manner as to avoid the Franchise Fee. 
(5)  In the event that any other video services provider, including but not limited to a cable operator or open video service provider, enters into any agreement or makes any arrangement with City during the term of this Agreement whereby it is required or allowed to pay a fee to the City that is similar to the Franchise Fee described herein, [the] City shall allow Cox to substitute the definition of "gross revenue" set forth in that agreement or arrangement for the definition of "gross revenue" set forth in this Agreement immediately upon request of Cox.

(C)  During the term of this Agreement, Cox shall provide to the City one dedicated, noncommercial access channel for use by governmental and educational institutions within the City through Cox's Cable System so long as [the] City and educational institutions designated by the City provide any educational or governmental programming content in a standard format compatible with Cox's technology. [The] City and educational institutions designated by the City shall provide this programming, and Cox shall receive this programming, at Cox's headend location in the City of Tulsa, Oklahoma. [The] City and educational institutions designated by the City will be solely and individually responsible for their own programming content. 
(D)  Cox shall comply with the federal Emergency Alert System regulations (47 CFR 11). 
(E)  The parties agree to consult in the event that, after execution of this Agreement, any court, agency, commission, legislative body, or other authority of competent jurisdiction issues a finding that limits the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, in whole or in part. Should the finding be final, non-appealable and binding upon either [the] City or Company, this Agreement shall be deemed modified or limited to the extent necessary to address the subject of the finding unless either party, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the ruling, provides written notice to the other party of election to terminate, in which case this Agreement shall terminate within six (6) months or such earlier period as the parties mutually may agree. Where the effect of a finding is a modification, the parties shall enter into good faith negotiations to modify this Agreement in the manner which best effectuates its overall purposes and the intentions of the parties. Failure to reach a mutually satisfactory modification within ninety (90) days of the commencement of such efforts shall entitle either party to terminate the Agreement on the provision of thirty (30) days' written notice. 
In addition to the termination rights set forth above, Cox shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and all obligations hereunder upon ninety (90) days notice to the City, if (i) state or federal law changes in a manner that would allow Cox to opt into franchise requirements that are, in Cox's sole judgment, more beneficial than those contained herein; or (ii) another provider of video services is permitted, through a City authorization or otherwise, to use the public rights-of-way to provide video services on terms that are, in Cox's sole judgment, more beneficial than those contained herein. 
(F)  Cox shall determine, in its sole discretion, where in the City its facilities shall be constructed, operated, maintained, repaired and upgraded to provide, and where in the City to provide its Cable Services. However, Cox agrees that it will offer Cable Service to all residential subscribers residing within its current service footprint within the boundaries of the City, subject to density, technical feasibility, and access limitations based on standard industry practice (e.g., density limitation of forty (40) homes per mile, authorized access to private property/developments, etc.). 
(G)  Cox shall maintain in full force and effect, at no cost and expense to the City, during the term of this Agreement, commercial general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury, and property damage. The City shall be designated as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be noncancellable except upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the City. Upon written request, Cox shall provide a certificate of insurance showing evidence of coverage required by this section.

the front yard setback of the two nearest front corners of the encroaching buildings.
D. If the proposed building is to be located within 200 feet of an encroaching building on one side,
but not both sides, and there are no intervening buildings, the front yard or building setback shall

an end point to form one boundary of the triangle, and bounded by a line measured
from the center of a second connecting street and extended along the second curb
line of the corner lot for a distance of seventy-five feet (75) to an end point to form
the second boundary of the triangle; and bounded by a straight line connecting the
two (2) end points of the first two (2) boundaries.

SECTION 214 PLATTING REQUIREMENT
For the purposes of providing a proper arrangement of streets and assuring the adequacy of open
spaces for traffic, utilities, and access of emergency vehicles, commensurate with the intensification
of land use customarily incident to a change of zoning, a platting requirement is established as
follows:
For any land which has been rezoned upon application of a private party, no building
permit shall be issued until that portion of the tract on which the permit is sought has
been included within a subdivision plat or replat, as the case may be, submitted to
the Planning Commission for their review and recommendation, approved by the City
Commission, and filed in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the
property is situated. Provided that the Planning Commission may remove the platting
requirement upon a determination that the above stated purposes have been
achieved by previous platting or could not be achieved by a plat or replat.
SECTION 215 MAJOR STREET PLAN
The City of Collinsville Street and Highway Plan, hereafter referred to as The Major Street Plan, as
adopted by the City Commission of the City of Collinsville, is hereby made a part thereof.

SECTION 920 BULK AND AREA REQUIREMENTS
920.1 Intensity of Use
It is the intent of this Code that the aggregate intensity of use within the Planned Unit Development
remain substantially the same as that which would be permitted if the area were developed
conventionally, but that within the development, the intensity may be reallocated irrespective of the
general zoning district boundaries.
A. Residential Intensity
The residential intensity shall not exceed a maximum number of dwelling units computed as
follows:
Maximum number of Permitted Dwelling Units =
Gross Area* of property located within a residential district divided by
minimum land area per dwelling unit permitted in the applicable use district.
The minimum land area per dwelling unit, for the purpose of the above described
computation shall be the least restrictive minimum land area per dwelling unit permitted in the
applicable district as set forth in Section 430.1, and Section 430.2. Each 600 square feet of a
quasi-dwelling, such as a care home, shall constitute a dwelling unit. If the PUD is within two
or more residential districts, the permitted density shall be the sum of the permitted dwelling
units computed separately for the gross area within each district. For a PUD located totally
within a residential district or districts, the gross area for the purposes of the above described
computation shall be reduced by the area or areas designated for any principal use other
than dwelling, quasi-dwellings, residential open space and recreation areas.
B. Nonresidential Intensity
The nonresidential intensity shall not exceed a maximum permitted floor area computed as
follows:
Maximum Permitted Floor Area =
Gross Area* of property located within a nonresidential district multiplied (X) by the
floor area ratio permitted either by right or exception within the bulk and area
requirements of the applicable use district, except where a floor area ratio is not
specified, a floor area ratio of .75 shall apply.
*For the purpose of intensity computations, gross area shall mean the lot area plus ½ of the
right-of-way of any abutting street to which the lot has access.
The intensity of use of a PUD located within two or more zoning districts of the following differing
general classifications:
Residential
Office
Commercial
Industrial
shall be separately calculated and allocated within the Planned Unit Development by said
general classification.
920.2 Lot Width and Lot Area Minimums
Within a PUD, a minimum lot size requirement of 800 square feet shall apply to lots utilized for
dwelling purposes. A minimum lot width requirement of 20 feet shall apply to lots utilized for dwelling
purposes.
920.3 Livability Space
Within a PUD, livability space shall be provided in an aggregate amount of not less than the amount
of livability space required by the applicable use district (Section 430.1) for conventional development
of comparable number of dwelling units. Required livability space shall be provided on the lot
containing the dwelling unit or units on which computed, or in common areas. Common livability
space shall be designed and located so as to be accessible to the dwelling units it is intended to
serve. Provisions for the ownership and maintenance of common livability space as will insure its
continuity and conservation shall be incorporated in the subdivision plat, in compliance with the
provisions of Section 950.5.
920.4 Building Height and Yards
Within a PUD, the Planning Commission shall prescribe building height limitations and minimum
yards, which shall be incorporated with the subdivision plat in compliance with the provisions of
Section 950.5.
920.5 Setbacks from Abutting Public Streets
Within a PUD, building setbacks from abutting public streets, for residential use, shall not be less than
as prescribed for an RM-1 District as set out within Section 430.1. Within a PUD, building setbacks
from abutting public streets for nonresidential uses shall not be less than as prescribed for an OM
District as set out within Section 530.
SECTION 930 PERIMETER REQUIREMENTS
The Planning Commission shall prescribe perimeter requirements for screening, landscaping, and
setbacks, as are necessary to assure compatibility with adjoining and proximate properties, which
shall be incorporated within the subdivision plat in compliance with the provisions of Section 950.5.
SECTION 940. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided as specified in the applicable use units and in
conformance with the requirements of Chapter 11, Off-Street Parking and Loading. Required spaces
may be provided on the lot containing the uses for which it is intended to serve or in common areas.
Common parking area shall be designed and located so as to be accessible to the uses it is intended
to serve. Provisions for the ownership and maintenance of common parking space as will insure its
continuity and conservation shall be incorporated in the subdivision plat, in compliance with the
provisions of Section 950.5.

SECTION 1200 GENERAL
Within the districts established by this Code or amendments that may later be adopted there exist
uses, structures, and lots which were lawful before this Code was adopted or amended by which
would be prohibited under the terms of this Code or future amendment to this Code. These uses,
structures and lots, herein referred to as nonconnformities, may continue as regulated by this
chapter. A use lawfully existing prior to the effective date of this Code, or amendment thereto, which
does not comply with a parking, loading screening, bulk and area, accessory sign or enclosure
requirement or requirements, but which is otherwise lawful; shall not constitute a nonconforming use
within the meaning of Sections 1210 and 1220.
SECTION 1210 NONCONFORMING USES OF UNIMPROVED LAND
When at the effective date of this Code or amendment thereto a lawful use of land exists, which
would not be permitted by the terms of this Code or amendment thereto, and the only structures
employed in connection with such use are all accessory or incidental to such use and in the
aggregate do not cover more than 10 percent of the lot area devoted to the nonconforming use, such
shall be deemed a nonconforming use of unimproved land and shall terminate as follows:
A. If the replacement costs of the accessory structures (other than fences) is less than $1,000.00,
the nonconforming use shall terminate within five years from the effective date of this Code or
from the date the use became nonconforming, whichever is later.
B. If the replacement cost of the accessory structures (other than fences) is $1,000.00 or more, the
nonconforming use shall be terminated on the basis of amortization of the replacement cost of
the accessory structures at a rate of $200.00 per year from the effective date of this Code or
from the date the use became nonconforming, whichever is later.
Pending termination, the nonconforming use of land may be continued provided:
A. No such nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use, nor enlarged or
increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date
of this Code or amendment thereof.

nonconforming use of land.
D. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 90 days
(except when government action impedes access to or use of the premises), any subsequent
use of such land shall conform in all respects to the regulations of the district in which located.
SECTION 1220 NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS OR BUILDINGS AND LAND IN
COMBINATION
When at the effective date of this Code or amendment thereof, there exists a lawful use of a building,
or use of a principal building and land, or use of land and accessory structures, such structures
covering more than 10 percent of the lot area, and such use would not be permitted by the terms of
this Code or amendment thereto, such use shall be deemed nonconforming and may continue
subject to the following provisions:
A. No building devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or extended, except in changing
the use of the building to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
B. A nonconforming use of a portion of a building may be extended to the remaining portions of the
building if such portions were manifestly arranged and designed for such use but such use shall
not be extended to occupy any land outside the building.
C. A nonconforming use of a building or building and land in combination, if discontinued for 12
consecutive months or for 12 months during any 18 month period (except when governmental
action impedes access to or the use of the premises), shall not thereafter be resumed.
D. A nonconforming use of a building or building and land in combination, if discontinued for 12
consecutive months or for 12 months during any 18 month period (except when governmental
action impedes access to or the use of the premises), shall not thereafter be resumed.
E. Where nonconforming use status applies to a building and land in combination, termination of
the use of the building within the meaning of (D) above shall eliminate the nonconforming status
of the use of the land.
F. A nonconforming use of a building or of a building and land in combination when located within
a residential district shall not be changed unless changed to a use permitted in the district in
which located. A nonconforming use of a building or of a building and land in combination, when
located within a district other than a Residential District, may, as a Special Exception, be
changed upon approval of the Board of Adjustment after finding that the proposed use will not
result in any increase of incompatibility with the present and future use of proximate properties.
The change of a use to another use contained within the same use unit shall not constitute a
change of use within the meaning of this section.
G. Should the structure containing a nonconforming use be damaged or partially destroyed to the
extent of more than 50 percent but less than 75 percent of its current replacement cost at the
time of damage, the restoration of the structure shall be subject to the Board of Adjustments
findings, after adherence to the procedural requirements for a Special Exception, that the
contemplated restoration is necessary for the continuance of the nonconforming use, and will not
result in any increase of incompatibility with the present and future use of proximate properties.
Should the structure containing a nonconforming use be damaged or destroyed to the extent of
more than 75 percent of its replacement cost at the time of damage, the nonconforming use
shall not thereafter continue or be resumed.

principal use, shall be removed within six months from the date the sign become
nonconforming.
SECTION 1240 NONCONFORMING LOTS
A. Single Lots: In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance, a single-family dwelling and
customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership
and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall
apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district, provided that no lot shall be less than 50 feet, and
provided that no side yard shall be less than 5 feet in width, and all other requirements to the
district are complied with.
B. Adjoining Lots: If two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in a single
ownership at any time after the adoption or amendment of this ordinance and such lots
individually are to small to meet the yard, width or area requirements of the district in which

minimum permitted size and the lot or lots in one ownership shall be subject to the
requirements of this ordinance.
C. In districts other than residential districts, any use permitted by right in the applicable district
may be located on any lot of official record at the effective date of this Code, irrespective of
its area or width, provided the other requirements of the use district are complied with.
SECTION 1250 STRUCTURAL NONCONFORMITIES
A structure, lawfully existing at the effective date of the adoption or amendment of this Code, but
which would be prohibited by the terms of this Code by reason of restrictions on floor area,
density, intensity, height, yards, its location on the lots, or other requirements concerning the
structure, shall be deemed nonconforming and may continue, subject to the following provisions:
A. No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any manner which
increases its nonconformity, but any structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity,
provide that the addition of a mezzanine or similar alteration which does not increase the
cubic content of the structure shall not constitute an increase in nonconformity.
B. Should such structure, except antennas and antenna supporting structures, be damaged or
partially destroyed by means to the extent of more than fifty (50%) of its current replacement
cost at time of damage, the restoration as a conforming structure shall be subject to the
Board of Adjustments finding, after adherence to the procedural requirements for a Special
Exception, that its restoration to a conforming structure cannot reasonably be made in view
of the nature and extent of the damages. Antenna and antenna supporting structures, if
damaged or destroyed by any means, may be reconstructed by obtaining a building permit
issued only in compliance with the original conditions of approval; provided that the antenna
and antenna supporting structure is placed at the same location and has less than or

physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and a final order of
vacation or demolition is entered by any duly authorized official by reason of physical
condition, it shall not thereafter be used, restored or repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity
with the provisions of the district in which located.

Collinsville Subdivision Regulations
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.1 TITLE
These Regulations shall hereafter be known, cited and referred to as the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Collinsville, Oklahoma.
1.2 PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
1.2.1 Purpose: The arrangement of parcels of land in Collinsville for residential, commercial and industrial uses and for public needs, such as streets and easements, etc. will to a large degree determine the health, safety, economy and quality of life in the city. Such amenities are a public concern. These Regulations and standards for the subdivision of land are intended to insure the development and maintenance of a safe, healthy, attractive and efficient community and provide for the conservation of its human and physical resources.
1.2.2 Intentions: These Regulations are specifically intended to:
A. Establish a subdivision process that is as expeditious and efficient as possible while providing for public health, safety and general welfare.
B. Harmoniously relate development of the various tracts of land to the existing community and facilitate the future development of adjoining tracts.
C. Provide that the cost of improvements which primarily benefit the tract of land being developed be borne by the owners or developers of the tract.
D. Provide the best possible design for the tract.
E. Provide a proper arrangement of streets and assure the adequacy of open spaces for traffic and access of emergency vehicles commensurate with the intensification of land use customarily incident to a change of zoning.
F. Reconcile any differences of interest.
G. Ensure proper legal descriptions, monumenting of land and adequate and accurate platting and records of land subdivision.
H. Ensure that public facilities and utilities are available that will have sufficient capacity to serve the proposed subdivision and the general community.
2
I. Promote development that will preserve the natural beauty and physical characteristics of the land and will intrude upon the environment to the least possible extent.
J. Encourage designs which will require minimal maintenance of public improvements by the City.
1.3 AUTHORITY
These Regulations and Minimum Standards for land development are adopted under the authority granted by Oklahoma Statutes.
1.4 JURISDICTION
These Regulations shall apply to all subdivision of land located within the corporate limits of the City of Collinsville, Oklahoma.
1.5 SUBDIVISION PLAT REQUIREMENT AND WAIVER
For any land which has been rezoned upon application of a private party, no building permit shall be issued until that portion of the tract on which the permit is sought has been included within a subdivision plan or replat, as the case may be, submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission and City Council and filed of record in the office of the County Clerk where the property is situated. The Planning Commission, upon a showing that the purposes of these regulations have already been achieved by previous platting, or could not be achieved by a plat or replat, may waive the subdivision plat requirement.
1.6 PLAT VACATION AND ALTERATIONS
No vacation of a plat or any parts thereof, except by action of the District Court, shall be valid or impart notice until after the required consent of such platted area is presented to the City Commission and the approval of the Commission is entered thereon. All vacations or alterations of a final approved filed plat shall require the approval of City Staff, Planning Commission, and City Commission and the filing of a corrected plat, approved deed or accepted easement. Alterations of a plat without approval shall constitute a violation of these Regulations.
1.7 VARIANCE OF REGULATIONS
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements contained in these Regulations result in
3
substantial hardship or inequity, the Planning Commission may vary or modify, except as otherwise indicated, such requirements of design, but not of procedure or improvements, so that the subdivider may develop his property in a reasonable manner, but so that at the same time, the public welfare and interests of the City are protected and the purpose and intentions of these regulations are preserved. Such modification may be granted upon written request of the subdivider stating the reason for each modification and may be waived by three-fourths (3/4) vote of the members of the Planning Commission present, subject to the acceptance of the plat and the dedications thereon by the City Council. Variance of the Zoning Code must be granted by the Collinsville Board of Adjustment.
1.8 PROMULGATION OF RULES AND REGULATIONS
Upon adoption of this ordinance, the City Manager shall present Rules and Regulations relating to the implementation of the intent of the Subdivision Regulations to the City Commission for adoption by resolution. Provided, however, that the City Manager shall from time to time promulgate such additional Rules and Regulations, or changes to existing Rules and Regulations as considered necessary. The promulgation of such Rules and Regulations, in whole or in part, shall require the City Manager to notify the City Commission, Planning Commission, and Board of Adjustment in writing of the proposed Rules and Regulations and shall require the exact language of the proposal be attached to such notice. Such notice to the City Commission shall be published in the consent agenda of a City Commission meeting for acknowledgement of Council receipt of the change(s). Upon notification to the City Commission and for a period of 30 days, the proposed Rules and Regulations shall lay open and be subject to City Commission action to disapprove either in part or in whole. Absent action by the City Commission to disapprove proposed Rules and Regulations within the allotted time frame, such Rules and Regulations shall have the force and effect of law.
1.9 SEPARABILITY OF PROVISIONS
If any section, clause, paragraph, provision or portion of these regulations shall be held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, paragraph, provision or portion of these Regulations.
1.10 PENALTY
Any person or persons, firm, or corporation, who shall violate any of the provisions of these Regulations, or shall fail to comply therewith, or with any of the requirements thereof, shall be deemed guilty of an offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $200.00 and costs and/or 30

12
3.1 GENERAL
Subdivision design shall reflect the provisions of the Zoning Code, Collinsville Engineering Design Criteria, other city ordinances and these regulations to the end that each subdivision will relate harmoniously with adjacent areas and the community in an orderly, safe, efficient and attractive manner.
3.2 STREETS
3.2.1 Access:
A. Each lot of a subdivision shall be provided with access to a public street or approved private street or highway to assure convenience of
the lot owner as well as to provide for the layout of utilities, waste removal, deliveries and emergency services.
B. Lots shall not generally derive access from major streets. Provisions restricting ingress and egress to streets may be required by the Planning Commission and City Commission to assure traffic safety and to relieve congestion at intersections.
C. Double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation.
3.2.3 Abutting Arterial Streets: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Planning Commission may require service streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
3.2.4 Abutting Railroad or Highway Right-of-Way: Where a subdivision abuts or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning Commission and City Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be determined with regard for the requirements of approach grades and grade separation.
3.2.5 Through Traffic: Minor streets shall be arranged so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Industrial and commercial streets shall
13
not inject non-residential traffic into residential areas. The arrangement of streets within a subdivision shall, except for cul-de-sacs, connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining subdivisions or provide for future connections to adjoining unplatted tracts.
3.2.6 Adjacent Properties: Where adjoining properties are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets shall be projected to the boundary of the proposed subdivision with provisions made for a temporary right-of-way for a turn around of a size acceptable to the City Engineer. Barricades shall be installed at dead-end streets. Alignments, grades, drainage, and other appropriate design criteria of all streets within and bordering new subdivisions shall be governed by these regulations, where applicable, and by the Design Criteria of the City.
3.2.7 Reserve Strips: Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where approved by the Planning Commission and City Commission.
3.2.8 Future Development: Where a tract to be subdivided includes only a portion of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided remainder of the property shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.
3.2.9 Private Streets: Private streets shall not be approved, except when required by state law, or in connection with a Planned Unit Development having appropriate controls.
3.2.10 Street Offsets: Street offsets with center-line offsets of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall not be allowed.
3.2.11 Dedication of Right-of Way: Whenever an arterial is located adjacent to the outer edge of a subdivision, one-half (½) of the right-of-way shown on necessary to widen the arterial to five lanes shall be dedicated, if it is determined by the Planning Commission and City Council that such dedication is equitable and feasible for the other half of the right-of-way from the adjacent property. Half-street dedications on minor streets are prohibited.
3.2.12 Cul-de-sac Streets: All dead-end streets having a length of more than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall terminate in a cul-de-sac which has a circular turn-around having a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty (50) feet and a pavement radius of forty (40) feet. No such cul-de-sac street shall be
14
more than six hundred (600) feet in length measured from the entrance to the center of the turn-around.
3.2.13 Collector Streets: Collectors streets shall be so located as to provide for smooth traffic flow from local streets to arterials. Collector streets should normally be continuous for distances of not more than one half (½) mile, and offsets which are likely to induce continuing of traffic flow beyond that distance shall be avoided.
3.2.14 Street Names and Numbers:
A. No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. All north and south thoroughfares shall be designated "Avenues", all east and west thoroughfares shall be designated "Streets", and numbering of streets shall be according to the Tulsa County system. Where a street is an extension of an existing street, the existing name shall be used. Where a new street is not an extension of an existing street, new names or numbers may be used subject to the submission and approval from INCOG and the City.
B. Lot address numbers shall be established and shown on an address plat by the subdivider. INCOG shall review the address plat and inform the subdivider of any corrections of the address ranges. The subdivider shall make the corrections, if any, and shall submit with final plat three (3) copies of the final address plat. INCOG shall be responsible for the coordination of addressing lots and changing the addresses of lots.
3.2.15 Intersections: Streets shall be designed to intersect at right angles or as near to right-angles as possible. Within subdivisions, three-way intersections are preferable to four-way intersections. Right-of-way corners at minor street intersections shall have a minimum radius of twenty-five (25) feet. Right-of-way corners involving a major street or highway shall have a minimum radius of forty (40) feet.
3.2.16 Street Layout:
A. Local roads shall be curved whenever possible to avoid uniformity of lot appearance. All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Unless by reason of topographical uniqueness or hardship, a variance is approved by the Collinsville Board of Adjustment, all building sites shall be situated above the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep
15
grades and curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the Collinsville Engineering Design Criteria.
B. All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated right-of-way as already established.
C. Minor or local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
D. The rigid rectangular grid street pattern should be avoided and the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable layout.
E. Unless maintained by a homeowners organization, islands in streets shall be avoided.

1. The City of Collinsville City Commission deems it necessary; or
2. An application of the property owners owning more than one half in area of the property abutting the public way or easement to be closed is filed with the City of Collinsville and is subsequently reviewed by the City Commission.
It is also suggested that applicants vacate the public way or easement by proceeding through district court. A public way or easement can only be vacated after the City Council approves the closing ordinance and the ordinance is taken to the court. Vacating the public way or easement forecloses on the Citys right to reopen the public way or easement. No permit may be issued for any development in the easement or right-of-way of an area unless the easement or right-of-way has been closed and vacated.
3.6 PUBLIC AREAS AND OPEN SPACES

19
residential development from through traffic or overcome specific disadvantages of terrain and orientation.
3.6.3 Zoning Code Requirements: Lot dimensions, yard sizes, building setback line dimensions, and lot areas shall conform to the minimum requirements of the Zoning Code.
3.6.4 Corner Lots: Lots at the intersections of streets should exceed minimum Zoning Code area requirements to provide adequate building areas and required building setbacks from intersecting streets.
3.6.6 Lot Lines: Side lot lines should be approximately at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
3.6.6 Parking and Loading: Commercial and Industrial lots should be of an appropriate size and shape to provide for adequate off-street parking and loading facilities.
3.7 BLOCKS
The length, width and shape of blocks shall be suited for the planned use of land, consistent with Zoning Code requirements and the need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic and the limitations of terrain.
3.7.1 Length: Blocks for residential use shall normally not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty (1320) feet in length. When such a block exceeds eight hundred (800) feet, the City of Collinsville may require a dedicated easement not less than fifteen (15) feet in width and a paved crosswalk according to ANSI standards to provide pedestrian access across the block.
3.7.2 Width: Blocks for residential use shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth, except on the boundaries of a proposed subdivision or where it is important to separate residential development from other types of development or through traffic. Blocks intended for commercial, office or industrial uses should be of a width suitable for the intended use, with due allowance for off-street parking and loading facilities. Blocks for such uses should normally not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length.
20
3.8 BUILDING LINES AND ELEVATIONS
3.8.1 Zoning Code requirements: Building lines shall be provided for all subdivision plats in accordance with the requirements of the Zoning Code district in which the subdivision is located unless varied by the Board of Adjustment or superseded as specified by the Planned United Development text.

3.8.4 Pad Elevations: Minimum building pad elevations shall be shown on each lot included in the final plat.
3.9 FLOOD PLAIN AREAS
3.9.1 Prohibitions and Exceptions: Areas identified by the official flood plain maps of the City of Collinsville which are subject to flooding hazards and periodic inundations, shall not be subdivided into lots, tracts or parcels for any use which would be incompatible with such flooding hazards unless:
A. Improvements meeting the standards and requirements of the City Engineer are designed to render such land safe for residential or other uses, or
B. The intended use of the land is permitted by city ordinances or permitted by Variance or Special Exception as outlined by city ordinance.
3.10 OIL AND GAS WELLS
3.10.1 Setback from Producing Wells: Where there is found to be a producing oil or gas well which is within the boundaries of a proposed subdivision, there shall be a building setback line so placed on the plat to prevent the erection construction of a building within one hundred fifty (150) feet of such well.
3.10.2 Setback from or Plugging of Abandoned Wells: Where there is found to be an abandoned oil or gas well which is not adequately plugged according to the standards established by the state law and the Oklahoma
21
Corporation Commission, which well is within the boundaries of a proposed subdivision, said well shall be adequately plugged according to said standards and so certified by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission before the plat of such addition is given final approval. In lieu of plugging such wells, a building setback line shall be so placed on the plat to prevent the construction of a building within one hundred fifty (150) feet of such well. In any event, a certificate or clearance shall be obtained from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as to the existence of any wells reflected in their records.
3.10.3 Access: Access shall be provided and so indicated on the face of the plat for all unplugged wells for the purpose of maintenance and rework.
3.11 HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT

Areas with slope in excess of twenty percent (20%) shall be utilized as open space or developed in accordance with a Planned Unit Development as defined by the Zoning Code.
3.12 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
When a subdivision is developed as a Planned Unit Development in accordance with applicable provisions of the Zoning Code, the Planning Commission and City Commission may vary the requirements of these regulations in order to allow the subdivider more freedom in the arrangement of the subdivision but at the same time protect the convenience, health, safety, and welfare of the probable future residents of the subdivision as well as the character of the surrounding property and the general welfare of the entire community.
3.13 STORM WATER DRAINAGE AND DETENTION
Every subdivision shall be provided with a storm water drainage system adequate to serve the area being platted. Such storm water drainage system shall be designed so that property located downstream from and upstream from the subdivision shall not be injuriously affected by the construction, operation, or maintenance of such system. Storm water detention and drainage systems shall be designed according to the Collinsville Design Criteria. The covenants of each subdivision shall require that the subdivisions homeowners association be responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater drainage system and detention facilities.
22
3.14 HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS
For every residential subdivision platted and developed in Collinsville after the passage of these regulations, a homeowners association shall be created. Enforcement of the subdivisions covenants, and ownership and control over the subdivisions common areas shall be transferred to the homeowners association by the time that 85% of the lots within the subdivision have received building permits.
CHAPTER 4. SUBDIVISION CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES
4.1 IMPROVEMENTS SHALL MEET ESTABLISHED STANDARDS
All improvements shall be designed and installed in accordance with the Collinsville
Design Criteria established by the City Engineer and approved by the City
Commission. The City Engineer may establish special standards in excess of the
Collinsville Design Criteria which are generally applicable to safely accommodate unusual circumstances or the heavy commercial and industrial use of streets, utilities, water, sewer and other public improvements.
IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED
4.2.1 Street Improvements: The subdivider shall design, grade, oversee, test and otherwise improve all streets which are designated on the approved plat or which directly serve the subdivision in accordance with the Collinsville Design Criteria as directed by the City Engineer.
4.2.2 Street Traffic Control Devices, Signs and Names: The subdivider shall provide at his/her expense, and install, all traffic control devices and signs required by the City prior to acceptance of the street by the City Commission. Street name signs are to be furnished and installed by the subdivider at all intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type of which shall be in accordance with the specifications of the Collinsville Design Criteria and locations approved by the Collinsville City Inspector, and/or Public Works Director. Street names shall be approved by INCOG and City staff.
4.2.3 Fire Hydrant Reflector Turtles: The subdivider shall provide at his/her expense, and install, blue reflective turtles identifying all fire hydrants. Said
23
reflectors shall be located in the center of all residential streets wherever a fire hydrant is located.
4.2.4 Lights and Crossings: Street lights shall be installed by the franchised vendor providing the electrical service and shall be shown on preliminary and final street plans. The subdivider shall provide at his/her expense all electric crossings to serve electric for the lots within the subdivision.
4.2.5 Monuments and Markers: The location of all permanent markers shall be shown on the face of the Final Plat. Permanent reference markers shall be placed according to the specifications of the Collinsville Design Criteria.
4.2.6 Public Water Supply: Where an approved public water supply is reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall install water lines and fire hydrants to connect with such water supply and make it available for each lot within the subdivided area. The Final Plat shall not receive City Commission approval until it is certified by the Health Department that there has been compliance with the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Health and where indicated, meets other jurisdictional governing bodies' requirements.
4.2.7 Stormwater Drainage and Detention Facilities:
The subdivider shall provide a stormwater drainage system that is designed and constructed in accordance with the Collinsville Design Criteria.
4.2.8 Rural Roadside Drainage Standards: A. Definition:
Roadside ditches are engineered channels constructed along the sides of the roadway and located either wholly or partly within the street right-of-way. The purpose of these ditches is to collect storm water runoff from the roadway and adjacent tributary areas and convey the accumulated runoff to acceptable outlet points.
B. Permitted Uses:
Unless provided for by special exemption by the City Engineer, roadside ditches are permissible only in subdivisions within RE residential and AG agricultural zoning districts. Maintenance of roadside ditches shall be the responsibility of
24
the Homeowners Association of the subdivision, and shall be included within the covenants of the subdivision.
C. Easements:
Roadside ditches located within the street right-of-way do not require a drainage easement. Roadside ditches located otherwise shall have a dedicated drainage easement extending from the street right-of-way to two feet outside of the top of the outside bank (backslope) of the channel.
D. Design Procedures:
Design of roadside ditches should be based on a clear understanding of the generally recognized principles of open channel flow. Unless otherwise noted or excepted, the design of roadside ditches shall conform with the previous requirements of 0509 Open Channels. The Engineer may require additional analysis or documentation before approving atypical or non-conforming designs.
E. Design Goals:
Roadside ditches shall:
Accommodate the design runoff in a manner which assures the safety of motorists.
Provide sufficient conveyance to prevent damage to adjacent properties.
Drain subsurface water from the base of the roadway to prevent saturation and loss of support for the pavement.
Minimize long-term maintenance requirements by including design features that minimize deterioration from velocity-induced scour, sediment deposition at low velocity and ponding at runoff.
Mitigate erosion and other adverse environmental or aesthetic effects. F. Design Storm:
25
Engineered channels shall be designed to completely contain the 1% return frequency (100-year) storm within the boundaries of the drainage easement. Channels shall be stable, free from erosion damage and shall allow free drainage of the roadway base material during the 10% return frequency (10-year) storm.
G. Design Capacity:
The hydraulic capacity of the ditch should be such as to insure that the high water elevation at the 10-year (10% return frequency) design flow will be below the bottom of the roadway base course.
A pipe conveyance system shall be required when the design discharge exceeds the ditch capacity.
H. Flow Velocity:
The maximum velocity for the 100-year flood peak flow shall not exceed 5.0 feet per second for Type I ditches and 6.0 feet per second for Type II and Type III ditches. Type I and Type II ditches shall be designed with a maximum Froude Number of 0.8. Type III ditches shall be designed with a maximum Froude Number of 0.9. No grass lined or composite ditch or channel having a Froude Number of 1.0 or greater along any portion of its alignment will be approved.
Minimum velocity in a channel having a Mannings roughness coefficient less than or equal to 0.015 shall be 2.5 feet per second to avoid excessive sedimentation.
I. Typical Section:
The shape of a roadside channel section should minimize vehicular impact and provide a traversable section for errant vehicles leaving the traveled way. The ideal channel section, from a safety standpoint, will have flattened side slopes and a curved, parabolic transition to the channel bottom.
Ditch foreslopes for grass-lined ditches shall be designed with grades not to exceed 4 horizontal to 1 vertical. Ditch backslopes should be designed with the same grade; but may be approved up to 3 horizontal to 1 vertical depending on right-of-way or drainage easement constraints. For maintenance purposes, no grass-lined channel steeper than 3:1 will be approved.
26
Channel slopes shall not exceed the angle of repose of the soil and/or lining. Side slopes for channel linings other than grass will be approved based on the physical and hydraulic properties of the material. No roadside channel having a sideslope steeper than 2.5 horizontal to 1 vertical will be approved, regardless of the lining material
J. Horizontal Alignment/Alignment Changes:
Channel alignment changes shall be achieved by curves having a minimum radius of:
R = V2*W/8D where:
R = Minimum radius on centerline in feet
V = Design velocity (10-year) of flow in feet per second
W = Width of channel at water surface in feet D = Depth of flow in feet
or three (3) times the maximum top width at the design flow (10-year) depth, whichever is larger.
The Engineer may require additional analysis at bends to determine the possible need for additional freeboard or protection from velocity induced erosion.
K. Vertical Alignment/Longitudinal Slope:
In many cases, the grade of the side ditch will follow the profile grade of the roadway. These template ditches are generally constrained not only in profile grade, but also in alignment and cross section by the geometric and safety standards applicable to the project. In addition, maximum and minimum allowable velocities will define the upper and lower bounds of the longitudinal slope.
For special ditches whose slope differs from that of the profile grade, the Engineer may require a minimum slope of 0.2% to prevent ponding. Drop structures or ditch checks may be required to limit velocity where slopes
27
exceed 2.5%. Steeper longitudinal slopes may be allowed when the ditch is flowing partially full.
Vertical profiles for roadside ditches shall be shown on the roadway drawings. Grades of special ditches shall be indicated adjacent to their profile. Velocities for the 10-year and 100-year design events shall be included in the design data. Hydraulic and Energy Gradelines shall be included in the design data.
L. Freeboard:
Freeboard is not required for roadside ditches that conform to the design capacity and section described in 0509.2 E. Additional freeboard may be required at the outside of horizontal bends based on velocity and superelevation considerations.
The designer shall exercise care that the 100-year (1% return frequency) design flow will be no less than 2.0 feet below the finished floor of any adjacent dwelling or structure.
M. Roughness Coefficient:
The roughness coefficient, n, for use in Mannings equation for open channel flow, shall be based on the channel characteristics of each particular design. The table shown in 0509.1 C serves as a reference of possible values. Other values for specific characteristics may be considered if derived from reliable references. Mannings n for composite channels must reflect the relative surface area of the different materials.
N. Invert:
Ditch invert protection shall be used when design velocities exceed 5 feet per second. Ditch invert protection will be used at the upstream and downstream ends of all culverts.
O. Lining:
Linings for roadside ditches may be classified as either flexible or rigid. The difference between flexible and rigid channel linings is their response to changing channel shape. Flexible linings are able to conform to changes in the
28
channel shape while rigid linings will not. Where flexible linings are capable of withstanding design velocities, they are preferred over rigid linings. Flexible linings are constructed of the following materials:
i. Sod or seeded grasses
ii. Erosion control blankets
iii. Turf reinforcement blanket
iv. Machined rip-rap
v. Wire-enclosed rock (gabions or mattresses)
Rigid linings may consist of either cast-in-place concrete or grouted rip-rap. The use of rigid linings for roadside ditches is discouraged.
P. Erosion Control:
The designer shall verify that both temporary and permanent vegetative linings are suited to the hydraulic conditions of the channel for which they are specified and are capable of resisting erosion until they are permanently established. Sod should be placed parallel to the direction of flow and should be secured in place with pins or staples. Seeded grasses should incorporate erosion control blankets to insure soil stability until permanent vegetation is established. Ditches subject to highly erosive flows may require the use of permanent turf reinforcement mats.
The temporary erosion control plan during construction shall be sufficient to prevent sedimentation of drainageways, drainage structures and flood plain areas that could result in reduced flow capacity, excessive bank erosion, and erosion around structures or damage to adjoining property.
The permanent erosion control plan shall be sufficient to:
 Permanently stabilize all disturbed areas with permanent vegetation, including slopes and embankments.
 Prevent erosion from exit velocities at outlets of culverts
29
 Prevent gullying and scouring of roadside ditches and open channels from excessive shear stress through vegetation, linings, retention blankets, drop structures, etc. both during and after the vegetation establishment period.
 Protect the integrity of all structural improvements and prevent excessive continuing sedimentation from unstable right-of-way areas into drainage structures, channels and roadway ditches.
Reference 0604.7 Vegetative Best Management Practices for additional information and criteria.
Q. DRIVEWAY CROSSINGS
Minimum Size:
Driveway culverts shall be sized to pass the 10-year (10% return frequency) ditch flow capacity without overtopping the driveway. The minimum size for driveway culverts shall be 18 inches in diameter for round pipe or an equivalent crosssectional area for arch or elliptical shapes. Culverts shall be designed using inlet control.
Construction Material:
Construction materials listed in 0510.2 A are acceptable for driveway culvert construction. Driveway culverts constructed of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) Pipe are acceptable only if the driveway is constructed of concrete of no less than 6 inches thickness.
Minimum Cover:
Driveway culverts shall be provided with the minimum cover recommended by the pipe structural design requirements or 1 foot, whichever is greater.
Minimum Slope:
A minimum slope shall be provided to maintain a minimum velocity of 2.5 feet per second through the culvert for the design flow.
Culvert End Treatments:
All culverts shall be provided with end treatments on the upstream and downstream ends of the culvert to protect and maintain the integrity of the culvert opening. ODOT Standard Sloped Concrete End Treatments conforming to ODOT Standard Drawing R-80 (AE-DE) are acceptable. Other end sections must be submitted to the Engineer for approval.
Design and Construction of Driveway Culverts:
30
Additional information must be included in the drainage report and on the construction drawings for new subdivisions where the use of roadside ditches and driveway culverts is proposed. Driveway culverts shall be sized for each lot in the subdivision based on the tributary area at the downstream lot line. The construction drawings shall include information regarding sizes, materials, locations, lengths, grades and end treatments for all driveway culverts. Typical driveway crossing/culvert details shall be included in the drawings.
Maintenance:
Maintenance responsibilities for driveway culverts shall be included and explained in the subdivision covenants.
4.2.9 Sanitary Sewer System:
A. Unless an exemption is granted in writing by the City Engineer, all lots platted within the Collinsville City limits shall be provided with a connection to sanitary sewer. All connections shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer and be in accordance with the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Health.
B. Where a public sanitary sewer system is not reasonably accessible but where plans for the installation of private sanitary sewers in the vicinity of the subdivision have been prepared and approved by the Oklahoma State
Department of Health, the subdivider shall install sewers in conformity with such plans.
4.2.10 Utilities: All utilities shall be installed within easements specified on the subdivision plat.

5.2.2 Specifications: The drawing shall include the proposed changes and all existing curb cuts, buildings, drives, parking areas, easements, and other relevant items with their distances from lot lines and adjacent streets.
CHAPTER 6. LOT SPLITS
6.1 INTENTIONS AND DEFINITION
This chapter is intended to provide for a simplified method of regulation of the subdivision of small numbers of lots while still requiring that such subdivision meets all the requirements of applicable ordinances and regulations.
A lot split is a minor subdivision of previously subdivided land. The Planning Commission may approve a lot split that creates not more than three (3) lots fronting on an existing, dedicated street, not involving any new street or road, or the extension of municipal facilities, or the creation of any public improvements, and not adversely affecting the remainder of the parcel or adjoining property, and not in conflict with any provision or portion of the
34
Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance (unless approved by the Board of Adjustment) or these regulations.
6.2 APPLICATION PROCEDURE
The subdivider shall submit the lot split application to the City Planner on forms provided by the Planner, pay the application fee in an amount as provided by ordinance, and shall submit drawings of the proposal in accordance with the following requirements:
6.2.1 Copies: Unless instructed otherwise by the City Planner, one AutoCAD electronic copy and three copies of a scaled drawing shall accompany the application.
6.2.2 Specifications: The drawings shall include all existing and proposed lot lines, all existing easements, all existing buildings and improvements and their distances from lot lines, adjacent streets and their widths, and a north arrow and scale. At the discretion of the Planning Commission, a detailed survey prepared by a registered land surveyor may be required.
6.2.3 Size: The subdivider is encouraged to limit drawing sizes to 8½" by 14". If drawings are larger than 8½" by 14", eight (8) copies are required.

7.3.5 Recommendation: The City Planner shall prepare a recommendation to the
Planning Commission which shall include comments of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) members and City departments having an interest in the proposal.
7.4 TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE REVIEW
The City Planner shall present the application at a regular Technical Advisory Committee meeting where the lot split may be reviewed by the Committee.
35
The recommendation of the Technical Advisory Committee shall be compiled with that of the City Planner's recommendation and the application shall be heard by the Planning Commission.
7.5 PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW
The Planning Commission shall review the proposed lot split and either approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the application. If the lot split is disapproved, the applicant may appeal the decision of the Planning Commission to the City Commission.
7.6 APPROVAL GUIDELINES
The approval or disapproval of lot splits shall be based upon the following guidelines: 7.6.1 Lots:
A. Lot dimensions shall conform to Zoning Code standards. If the proposed tract(s) to be split do(es) not meet minimum Zoning Code standards, variances of the Zoning Code must be approved by the Board of Adjustment.
B. Corner lots should have such extra width and area as may be necessary to satisfy appropriate Zoning Code setback requirements from both streets while ensuring that adequate buildable space remains.
7.6.2 Access and Streets:
A. Where a property to be split is controlled by non-access provisions, no lot shall be approved where such provision will preclude access for said lot. An amendment of "limits of no access" on a recorded plat must be approved by the Planning Commission and City Commission and filed of record if there is a restricted access provision on a street of the recorded plat on which the property has access. A denial of access change constitutes a denial of the requested lot split. B. The splitting of land shall provide each lot with frontage to a public street or highway, so that the access of the lot owner or user is assured, as well as the layout of utilities, garbage and waste removal, fire protection and public health and safety thereby adequately assured.
C. Where land to be split contains within its boundaries areas designated for street right-of-way on the Collinsville Major Street and Highway Plan, the split shall not be approved where street rights-of-way fail to conform to said plan except upon a finding that existing structures lie in the right-of-way proposed by the Collinsville Major Street and Highway Plan.
7.6.3 Sewage Disposal: Where a tract to be split abuts a public sanitary sewer, no split should create a lot which is cut off from said sewer.
7.6.4 Certificate of Approval: Approval shall be shown by certificate on the instrument of transfer as required by state statute. The certification shall be
36
signed by the Planning Commission Chairperson or Vice Chairperson or designated staff. The subdivider will then file the instrument with the County Clerk, the approval being an official document that will be contained in the abstract of the property being split.
CHAPTER 8. BUILDING PERMITS
8.1 INTENTIONS
Building permits shall be issuable after completion of the following items:
A. Final Plat Recorded. The final plat shall have been approved by the City Commission, certified, recorded with the appropriate county clerk, and certified originals returned to the City Planner as provided herein.
