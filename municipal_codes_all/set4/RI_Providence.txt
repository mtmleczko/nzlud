PREFACE 
    This publication is a reprinting and updating of the Code of Ordinances for the City of Providence, Rhode Island. It contains ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent nature as adopted by the City Council of the City of Providence in 1968 and subsequent revisions and amendments thereto through and including Ord. 2014, Ch. 2014-57. 
    Part I of this volume contains the Charter Laws of the City of Providence, Rhode Island, as amended, followed by a disposition table giving the disposition of each Act of a general and permanent nature, included in Part I. Part II contains the Code of Ordinances of the City of Providence, being a revision and codification of the ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent nature of the City of Providence, and the ordinances and resolutions amendatory thereof and appropriate for inclusion. Attention is also invited to the Code Appendix immediately following Part II, which at the time of this codification includes the following: Appendix A, "Will of Marshal H. Gould"; Appendix B, "Ordinances Approving and Adopting Redevelopment Plans"; Appendix C, "Table of Bond Issues Outstanding"; and Appendix D, "Public Laws Relating to the City." Following the Appendices is a comparative table of the ordinances and resolutions included in Part II of this publication and their disposition. 
    Part II is the Code of Ordinances, and as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances and resolutions not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the adopting ordinance. Special ordinances or resolutions or those dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the city, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, changing street names, granting franchises, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances or resolutions which are not included in Part II, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The chapters have been arranged in alphabetical sequence and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. In addition footnotes tie related sections of the Code together and direct reference to relevant state laws. 
    The source of a section is included in the history note enclosed in parentheses at the end of a section. The absence of a history note indicates that the section was adopted for the first time with the adoption of this Code. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number, e.g., new material may be included between Chapters 12 and 13, by designating it as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same manner, or in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division, as the case may be. 
    A special feature of this volume to which the attention of the user is particularly invited is the loose-leaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this loose-leaf system, this volume may be kept up-to-date periodically. Acts of the State Legislature which amend the Charter or pertain to the City can be inserted after reprinting the pages affected, adding new pages or deleting pages in case of repeal. Likewise, amendatory ordinances, upon final passage by the City, can be edited and the page or pages affected reprinted for insertion in the Code. In such event, the new or reprinted pages then shall be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. To each amendment will be attached an amendment or editorial note explaining briefly the effect of the amendment upon the section or sections amended and the derivation of such amendment. Each such subsequent amendment when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    Each index entry has been placed under several headings, some being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which are intended as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. Additions, alterations and deletions in the index will be accomplished in the same manner as is provided for additions, alterations and deletions to the substantive provisions of this publication. 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

    The successful maintenance of this Code and keeping it up-to-date at all times depends largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it shall then become the responsibility of the holder to insert the amendments according to the accompanying instructions. It is earnestly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacement, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Ms. Lori Hagen, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance, and for the interest shown by her in the preparation of the manuscript of this publication. Credit is gratefully acknowledged also to the members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout this project. 
    This republication was under the direct supervision of Connie Hamilton, Editor, and Karyl Rivers, Proofreader, of the editorial staff of Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida, and is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Providence, Rhode Island.

204. - Wards and ward boundaries. 
    The city shall be divided into fifteen (15) wards, the boundaries of which shall be drawn pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(a)  The city council shall, following each federal decennial census, enact an ordinance providing for the establishment of the boundary lines of the fifteen (15) wards of the city, said boundary lines to be established following the federal census of 1980, and to be revised as necessary to conform to the criteria set forth in subsection (b) of this section, following the federal census of 1990 and each census thereafter. 
(b)  The procedure for establishing or revising the ward boundary lines, as the case may be, shall be the following: 
(1)  At its first meeting in September, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011, and at its first meeting in January each tenth year thereafter, the city council shall elect a committee on ward boundaries of five (5) members, who may be members of the city council or other qualified persons who are electors of, and are domiciled in, the city as defined in Section 206 below. Three (3) members are to be elected by the majority party, and two (2) members are to be elected by the members of the city council who are not members of that party. The committee shall draw up a plan for establishing or revising the ward subject to the following requirements: 
(A)  The committee will hold at least four (4) public meetings, during which public comment will be accepted, at various locations throughout the City of Providence before designating a map to submit to the city council for approval; 
(B)  The committee will provide public notice at least seventy-two (72) hours before holding its meeting to approve the final map that is submitted to the city council for approval. Public comment will be accepted at this meeting prior to the vote; 
(C)  The committee will submit with the final map a written report of findings and reasons for adoption which includes notation of all criteria employed in the process and a full analysis and explanation of decisions made by the committee; 
(D)  All committee meetings will comply with the Open Meetings Act. 
(2)  Upon receiving the plan, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing thereon, following the completion of which the city council shall adopt the plan as presented or with such amendments as it shall think proper. Final approval will require two (2) separate votes by the city council, with the second vote taking place no sooner than seventy-two (72) hours after the first one. Final approval will require a vote of at least two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of all city council members attending the meeting at which the vote is taken. 
(3)  The procedure set forth in this subsection shall be completed no later than March 1, 1982, in the case of the committee appointed in September, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 and May first of each tenth year thereafter. 
(c)  The committee on ward boundaries and the city council shall insure that said boundaries are drawn in accordance with the following criteria: 
(1)  Equality of ward populations so far as practicable; 
(2)  Contiguousness of the territory of each ward; 
(3)  Wards shall comply with the federal Voting Rights Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1971 and following). 
(4)  The geographic integrity of any local neighborhood, or local community of interest, shall be respected in a manner that minimizes their division to the extent possible without violating the requirements of any of the preceding subdivisions. A community of interest is a contiguous population which shares common social and economic interests that should be included within a single ward for purposes of its effective and fair representation. Examples of such shared interests are those common to an urban area, an industrial area, and those common to areas in which the people share similar living standards, use the same transportation facilities, have similar work opportunities, or have access to the same media of communication relevant to the election process. Communities of interest shall not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates. 
(5)  To the extent practicable, and where this does not conflict with the criteria above, wards shall be drawn to encourage geographical compactness such that nearby areas of population are not bypassed for more distant population. 
(6)  The place of residence of any incumbent or political candidate shall not be considered in the creation of a map. Districts shall not be drawn for the purpose of favoring or discriminating against an incumbent, political candidate, or political party. 
(d)  If the Charter is revised to change the number of ward-based districts for an election to take place prior to the next decennial census, the city council will determine the new ward boundaries in compliance with the procedures and standards set forth above, except that the date for forming the ward boundaries committee will be January 1 of the year preceding the election, and the date for completing the ward boundary map will be May 1 of the year of the election. 
(Res. No. 515, 8-8-12) 
205. - Swearing in of elected officials. 
    The mayor and the members of the city council, before taking office, shall first be sworn or affirmed to the faithful discharge of their duties, and to the support of the Constitution and laws of the State of Rhode Island and of the Constitution of the United States, in the form and manner provided by law. The oath shall be administered by the judge of the probate court of the City of Providence, or in the judge's absence by the clerk thereof; such oath shall be administered only to a candidate or candidates to whom a certificate of election has been issued as required by law; provided, however, that said oath may be refused to any candidate where the election of such candidate shall have been declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
206. - Vacancies in elective offices. 
(a)  Vacancies in the offices covered by the provisions of this article shall be defined and filled pursuant to the provisions of this section. For the purposes of this section, a vacancy in a city elective office shall be declared to exist by the city council in the event the incumbent thereof: 
(1)  Dies; 
(2)  Holds any other elective public office carrying a salary, whether such office be municipal, state, or federal; 
(3)  Ceases to be domiciled in, and a qualified elector of, the city; or, in the case of a member of the city council, ceases to be domiciled in, and a qualified elector of, the ward from which the member of the city council was elected. As used herein, domiciled shall mean "that place where a person has his or her, true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he or she is absent has the intention of returning"; 
(4)  Resigns; 
(5)  Is convicted of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude and has exhausted all appeals from said conviction; 
(6)  Is recalled as provided hereafter; or 
(7)  Is otherwise permanently incapable of performing his or her duties of office. 
    The city council shall provide by ordinance such definitions and procedures as may be necessary and appropriate to carry out its duties under this section, including but not limited to the suspension of an official convicted of a felony from performing any official duties until said official's status is finally determined. 
(b)  If a vacancy occurs in the office of mayor or of a member of the city council more than one hundred eighty (180) days before the time of holding the next succeeding regular city election, the city council shall call a special election for the purpose of filling such vacancy for the remainder of such person's term, such special election to be held within ninety (90) days of the date of the occurrence of such vacancy. If any such vacancy occurs one hundred eighty (180) days or less before the time of holding the next succeeding regular city election, the city council shall call a special election for said purpose, to be held within said period of ninety (90) days, on demand in writing signed by at least one-third of all the members of the city council, and filed with the board of canvassers and the city clerk at least one hundred (100) days prior to the time of holding the next succeeding regular city election. In the event that any state election, regular or special, or any city election for any other purpose shall be held within said period of ninety (90) days, the city council may in its discretion order any special election required by the provisions of this section to be held at the same time as such other city or state election. 
207. - Enforcement. 
    In the event that the city council does not declare a vacancy in the city council pursuant to section 206(a) above, any fifty (50) qualified electors of a single ward may file a signed statement with the city clerk charging that the member of the city council elected from said ward has ceased to possess one or more of the qualifications of office, and stating the particulars as to what lack of qualifications is charged. The city clerk shall present the charges to the city council at its next regular meeting, and at such meeting, the city council shall set a time and place for the holding of a public hearing thereon. Such hearing shall be held not more than fifteen (15) days after said meeting of the city council, and the city council shall determine whether the charges shall be sustained. Upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the entire city council, the seat shall be deemed vacant and shall be filled pursuant to the provisions of section 206(b) above. 
208. - Recall. 
    The mayor and members of the city council may be removed from office by recall, provided that recall may not be initiated during either the first six (6) months or the last year of an incumbent's term. The procedure to accomplish removal by recall shall be as follows: 
(a)  A declaration of intent to petition for recall shall be filed with the city clerk; in seeking recall of the mayor said declaration shall include the signatures of one thousand (1,000) qualified city electors, or in the case of members of the city council shall include the signatures of three hundred (300) qualified electors of the ward from which such member was elected; 
(b)  Within one hundred twenty (120) days of the presentation of said declaration, a written petition demanding the removal of the mayor or member of the city council shall be filed with the city clerk. When removal of the mayor is demanded, said petition shall include the signatures of fifteen (15) per cent of all qualified city electors, provided that no more than fifteen (15) per cent of the total signatures thereon may be from any one ward of the city. When removal of a member of city council is demanded, said petition shall include the signatures of twenty (20) per cent of the qualified electors of the ward from which such member of city council was elected. The signatures on any recall petition provided for in this subsection may be on separate papers, but to each separate paper there shall be attached a signed statement of the circulator thereof, who states therein under oath, that each signature appended to said paper was made in the presence of the circulator. All such papers comprising a recall petition may be bound together and filed as one instrument at one time, or may be filed at different times as separate papers; provided, however, that all such separate papers must be filed within the time limit set in this subsection. 
(c)  The city clerk shall refer said petition forthwith to the board of canvassers which shall within ten (10) days from the date of the filing of such petition examine it and shall from the voters registered determine the sufficiency thereof and certify the results to the city council forthwith; if the examination shows that the petition contains the requisite number of signatures, the city council shall order and fix, forthwith, a date for holding an election, which date shall not be less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days from the date that the board of canvassers certified the petition as sufficient; 
(d)  Each ballot at such election shall have printed thereon the following question: "Shall (name of person) be removed from the office of (name of office)?" Immediately following such question, there shall be printed on the ballot the following two (2) propositions in this order: 
"Yes" 
"No" 
(e)  In any such election, if a majority of the votes cast on the question of removal is affirmative, the person whose removal is sought shall thereupon be deemed removed from office as of certification of the results by the board of elections. 
(f)  The city council may, through ordinance, make other and further regulations for carrying out the provisions of this section not inconsistent herewith. 
209. - The initiative. 
    The right to enact ordinances is hereby granted to the qualified electors of the city by initiative, provided that such power shall not extend to the budget or capital programs or to any ordinance relating to the appropriation of money, or to the levy of taxes or to the salaries and benefits of city officials or employees. The initiative shall be exercised in the following manner: 
(a)  Whenever one thousand (1,000) qualified electors of the city petition the city council to enact a proposed ordinance, it shall be the duty of the city council to consider such proposed ordinance within seventy (70) days of receipt. Receipt, for the purpose of this subsection, shall be defined as the reading of said petition at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city council. 
(b)  The signatures on any initiative petition provided for in this subsection may be on separate papers; provided, however, that each such separate paper shall contain a full and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed ordinance and all such separate papers shall be bound together and filed as one instrument with the city clerk. To each said separate paper there shall be attached a signed statement of the circulator thereof, who states therein under oath, that each signature appended to said paper was made in the presence of the circulator. 
(c)  In the event that the city council shall fail to enact such proposed ordinance without amendment, and upon the receipt by the city clerk of a notarized referendum petition signed by an additional five (5) per cent of the qualified electors of the city, the city council shall submit such proposed ordinance to a vote of the people of the city at the next general election; provided, however, that said ballot referendum petition must be filed at least sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for such general election. 
(d)  The ballots used when voting upon such proposed ordinance shall include an ordinance title which shall state the purpose or intent of such ordinance, the question, "Shall the ordinance pass?" and shall set forth on separate lines the words "Yes" and "No." 
(e)  If a majority of the electors voting on the proposed ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, such ordinance shall thereupon become a valid binding ordinance of the city; an ordinance so adopted shall not be altered or modified by the city council within one year after the adoption of the ordinance at said general election. 
(f)  The city council may, by ordinance, make such other further regulations for carrying out the provisions of this section as are not inconsistent herewith.

    The city council or any duly authorized committee thereof may investigate the financial transaction of any office or department of the city and the acts and conduct of any city office, department or agency or to any matter upon which the city council may act and, by investigation, may secure information on any matter within its jurisdiction. In connection with such investigation, the city council may compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and other evidence. The subpoena power granted herein may be delegated upon the majority of a vote of its members, to any standing committee requesting same for a specified investigation. Subpoenas shall be signed by the presiding officer of the city council or the chairperson of any committee to which such power has been delegated and may be served and executed by an officer authorized by law to serve subpoenas.

Any such charges which the city council should choose to bring shall first be presented to the mayor, in writing. Not less than thirty (30) days after the delivery of such charges, the city council shall order a public hearing thereon, which hearing shall be held only after due notice to such person of the details of such charges and with reasonable provision for answer by said individual. The person so charged shall have the right to be heard, to be represented by counsel, and to request the city council to compel the attendance of witnesses and production of evidence, including relevant records of the city.

409. - Introduction and form of ordinances. 
    Every ordinance and resolution shall be introduced in written or printed form, and passed or adopted at each reading by a majority of the members of the city council then present. Every legislative act shall be by ordinance. When introduced, any ordinance requiring an appropriation of money for implementation shall bear a fiscal note prepared by the budget analyst stating the estimated annual cost of such ordinance.

(b)  Procedure for the passage of ordinances. No ordinance shall be passed until it has been read on two (2) separate occasions at least forty-eight (48) hours elapsing between the first and the second readings; provided, however, that the requirement for a second reading may be dispensed with in the case of emergency ordinances by a vote of not less than three-fourths of the entire city council. The second reading of each ordinance shall be in full, unless a copy thereof shall have been furnished to each member of the city council prior to such reading. 
411. - Public hearings. 
    The city council shall not take final action on the following types of legislation without a public hearing, which shall be held not less than ten (10) days following notice published in a newspaper circulated generally in the City of Providence: 
(a)  Salaries of elected officers of the city, appointed members of commissions, department and agency heads;

    A public hearing required or permitted by this Charter shall be preceded by a notice setting forth the date, time and a brief description of the substance of the hearings, such notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Providence not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing and posted in the office of the city clerk. 
412. - Mayor's veto and council reconsideration. 
    Each resolution or ordinance adopted by the city council shall, within twenty-four (24) hours of final passage thereof, be transmitted to the mayor by the city clerk. Any ordinance adopted by the city council as an emergency measure shall be acted upon by the mayor within three (3) days after receipt thereof by the mayor from the city clerk. All other ordinances or resolutions shall be acted upon by the mayor within ten (10) days of such receipt. The mayor shall either approve such ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council by signing and returning the same to the city clerk within the time limit applicable thereto, or the mayor shall disapprove and veto any resolution or ordinance, or veto or reduce any separate appropriation item or items, and shall return each such resolution or ordinance to the city clerk with written objections thereto within the time limit as aforesaid. Failure of the mayor to make such return within ten (10) days, or three (3) days in the case of an ordinance adopted as an emergency measure, shall constitute approval and such ordinance or resolution shall take effect at the time indicated therein without the mayor's signed approval. The city clerk shall note such fact on the official copy of such resolution or ordinance. If any separate appropriation item or items in any resolution or ordinance are vetoed or reduced by the mayor as herein provided, the remainder of any such ordinance or resolution may be approved by the mayor and, if not specifically approved by the mayor shall take effect without such approval and shall be so noted by the city clerk. 
    The city council may reconsider any resolution or ordinance vetoed or disapproved, or any separate appropriation item or items vetoed or reduced by the mayor, and if after such reconsideration two-thirds of the entire city council shall vote in favor of passage thereof, it shall become effective notwithstanding the mayor's action. 
    If a larger vote is required for the adoption of a measure by the provisions of this Charter, such larger vote shall be required to overcome the veto of the mayor. If the ordinance or resolution or separate appropriation item or items is not passed over the mayor's veto or reduction within thirty (30) days from the date of the delivery of the veto or reduction to the city clerk, as hereinbefore provided, the measure or items shall be lost, or shall stand reduced, as the case may be. 
(Election of 11-7-06) 
413. - Emergency measures. 
    To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or the public peace, the city council may adopt one or more emergency ordinances, but such ordinances may not levy taxes, grant, renew or extend a franchise, regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services or authorize the borrowing of money except as provided in Article VIII, section 807. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms. 
    An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the entire city council shall be required for adoption. After its adoption, the ordinance shall be presented to the mayor for his consideration as provided in section 412 of this article, and upon approval by the mayor, or in the case of a veto, repassage by the city council by an affirmative vote of three-fourths of all of its members, the same shall be published and printed as prescribed for other adopted ordinances. It shall become effective upon such date as shall be specified therein. Every emergency ordinance shall stand repealed as of the sixty-first day following the date on which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances. 
    An emergency justifying the implementation of this section shall be deemed to exist only in the event of a grave threat to the public peace, property, health or safety of the city resulting from riot, fire, flood, hurricane, blizzard or other calamity. It is hereby declared to be the policy of this Charter that such definition shall be strictly construed by the courts.

(a)  The assets of any investment account, including pension, endowment, and annuity funds, under the jurisdiction of the board of investment commissioners and/or the finance director (the "fiduciaries") shall not knowingly be invested in companies ("targeted companies") which either directly or through an affiliated instrumentality meet the following criteria: 
(1)  Provide revenues to the Sudanese government through business with the government, government-owned companies or government-controlled consortiums. 
(2)  Offer little substantive benefit to those outside of the Sudanese government or its affiliated supporters in Khartoum, Northern Sudan and the Nile River Valley; this "outside" population specifically includes the country's disaffected Eastern, Southern, and Western regions. 
(3)  Have either demonstrated complicity in the Darfur genocide or have not taken any substantial action to halt the genocide; Substantial action shall include but is not limited to curtailment of operations or public pressure on the Sudanese government. Simple company statements shall not constitute evidence of substantial action. 
(b)  Companies providing military equipment, arms, or defense supplies to any domestic party in Sudan, including the Sudanese government and rebels, shall automatically be targeted for divestment. A strong presumption shall also be made against any company providing any domestic party in Sudan with equipment that may be readily co-opted for military use, including radar systems and military-grade transport vehicles, unless that company has implemented safeguards against such co-option. 
(c)  Companies which, either directly or through an affiliated instrumentality, provide services clearly dedicated to social development for the whole country shall be excluded from divestment.

(2)  Holdings of public equity, corporate bonds, and Sudanese- government-issued bonds in commingled accounts that are passively-managed/indexed. Actively-managed, commingled accounts, for both public equity and fixed-income investments, will be excluded from immediate divestment. Such accounts are still covered under section (e) of this section. 
(3)  Private equity holdings with readily identifiable ties to Sudan. 
a.  "Readily identifiable" is left to the good faith judgment of the fiduciaries mentioned in this section. 
(e)  The finance director and board of investment commissioners shall submit letters to contracted managers of actively-managed, commingled accounts requesting that the manager consider creating an actively-managed, commingled account devoid of companies targeted as a result of this section. In the event of such an introduction, the fiduciaries shall transfer all assets in actively-managed, commingled accounts into the newly available, Sudan-free accounts in an expedited timeframe still consistent with the fiduciaries' prudent investor obligations. 
(f)  The list of targeted companies shall be determined by submitting the criteria in subsections (a)-(c) to a reputable and non-biased third-party research firm, such as, but not limited to, the Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. and KLD Research & Analytics. Such a list may require modifications as circumstances in Sudan evolve. 
(g)  Research attained through the process outlined in subsection (f) must, when possible, be supplemented by publicly available research, communication with potentially targeted companies and communication with states and institutions that have already divested. 
(h)  Reasons for eliminating or adding a company from a preliminary list of identified companies based on the process outlined in section if must be justified in writing and supported by available research. 
(i)  The finance director and board of investment commissioners shall take appropriate action to sell, redeem, divest or withdraw any investment held in violation of this act. 
(Ord. 2006, ch. 06-24, 4-20-06) 
Sec. 2-18. - Avoidance of purchasing items fabricated in sweatshops. 
(a)  Purpose. The city declares the city's intent to avoid purchases of items from sweatshops, and its desire to allocate its funds in a manner that enhances the rights and well-being of workers world-wide, while acquiring the best quality goods at reasonable cost. The council finds that contractors can have influence throughout their entire supply chain, and therefore have an obligation to workers in subcontractor and subsidiary factories in addition to their direct obligations to their own employees. The purpose of this section is to ensure that city procurement of apparel is made from responsible contractors and vendors who agree to adhere to the minimum employment standards required herein and to require their subcontractors and third-party suppliers to do the same, so that all employees involved in the city's procurement may be afforded the opportunity to a fair, humane work environment as described herein. 
The council finds the following labor practices inconsistent with international standards of human rights: 
(1)  Below-subsistence wages; 
(2)  Excessively long working hours; 
(3)  Unhealthy and unsafe working environments; 
(4)  Child, indentured, and forced labor; 
(5)  Disregard for local and international labor laws and workplace regulations; 
(6)  Disregard for fundamental women's rights; 
(7)  Repression of workers' rights to assemble and bargain collectively. 
(b)  Applicability-Apparel. This section shall apply to all city procurement of apparel totaling five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more. For purposes of this section, "procurement" shall include the purchase, rental, lease, laundering or dry cleaning of apparel, whether by contract, purchase order, or other means; and allowance and voucher programs for city employees to make their own purchases, except where a city collective bargaining agreement establishes a clothing allowance or voucher program, in which case the terms of the collective bargaining agreement shall control. This section shall also apply to contracts for the provision of city financial assistance, if five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more will be used for procurement of apparel. 
(c)  Definitions. 
(1)  Apparel means all garments or items of clothing any part of which is a textile produced by weaving, knitting or felting; and all shoes and other footwear. 
(2)  Contractor or vendor means a person or entity from whom the city has a current procurement relationship as that term is used in subsection (b) above, or who is bidding or proposing to provide apparel to the city under a procurement arrangement. 
(3)  Employee means any individual who may be required or directed by any employer, in consideration of direct or indirect gain or profit, to engage in any employment, or to go to or work or be at any time in any place of employment. "Employee" includes individuals whose work is permanent or temporary, or on a full-time or part-time basis. 
(4)  A fair wage is the total "take home" or "net" wage, earned during a country's legal maximum work week, but not more than forty-eight (48) hours. A fair wage provides for the basic needs (housing, energy, nutrition, clothing, health care, education, potable water, childcare, transportation and savings) of an average family unit of employees in the manufacturing employment sector of the country divided by the average number of adult wage earners in the family unit of employees in the manufacturing employment sector of the country. 
(5)  Subcontractor means a person, partnership, corporation or other entity that enters into a contract with a contractor or vendor for performance of some or all of the city-contracted work. For purposes of this section, "subcontractor" shall include all third-party suppliers or producers from whom the contractor or its contractors obtains or sources goods, parts or supplies for use on the city contract and is intended to include suppliers at all level of the supply chain. 
(d)  Employment standards for contractors and vendors. 
(1)  Domestic or foreign manufacturers, presumption. It is presumed that all contractors, subcontractors, third-party suppliers and other entities involved in the production of goods under city contracts at locations within the United States are subject to and will follow all applicable federal, state and local laws such as labor, employment, and safety laws. While this section is applicable to procurement of apparel from all sources, the standards in subsection (d) are intended primarily for subcontractors and suppliers located outside the United States where the applicable law or practices does not already provide the protections necessary to accomplish the goals of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or reduce the responsibility of contractors located within the United States to follow applicable law in their jurisdiction. 
(2)  Standards. Contractors shall adhere to or exceed the following minimum employment standards, and shall require all subcontractors, as defined in subsection (c)(5), to do the same. Wherever the word "contractor" is used below, the same requirement shall apply to subcontractors as defined in subsection (c)(5). 
These standards shall apply in all phases/aspects of the contractor's or their subcontractor's operations, including but not limited to, manufacture, assembly, finishing, laundering or dry cleaning, (where applicable), warehouse distribution, and delivery: 
a.  Wages and benefits contractors should recognize that wages are essential to meeting employees' basic needs. Contractors shall pay employees, at minimum, wages and benefits which comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and which provide for essential needs and establish a dignified fair wage for workers and their families. This must always meet or exceed any applicable minimum wage, or other "fair wage," "living wage" or other law that requires a wage that exceeds the applicable minimum wage, whichever is higher. 
b.  Working hours. Hourly and/or quota-based wage employees shall not be required to work more than forty-eight (48) hours per week or the limits on regular hours allowed by the law of the country of manufacture, whichever is lower, and be entitled to at least one (1) day off in every seven-day period, as well as holidays and vacations off.

d.  Child labor. Contractors shall not employ any person at an age younger than fifteen (15) (or fourteen (14), where, consistent with International Labor Organization practices for developing locations, the law of the country of manufacture allows such exception). Contractors and sub-contractors agree to consult with governmental, human rights, and nongovernmental organizations, and to take reasonable steps as evaluated by the city and any independent monitoring agency acting on behalf of the city, to minimize the negative impact on children released from employment as a result of implementation or enforcement of the section. 
e.  Forced labor. There shall not be any use of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or other forced labor. 
f.  Health and safety. Contractors shall provide a safe and healthy working environment to prevent employee accidents and injury to health arising out of or occurring in the course of employment or as a result of the operation of their facilities.

The contractor shall ensure that its operations comply with all health and safety conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) ratified and adopted by the country in which the production facility is located. 
g.  Nondiscrimination. No person shall be subject to any discrimination in employment; including but not limited to hiring, employment, recruitment or recruitment advertising, salary rates of pay or other forms of compensation, benefits, advancement, transfer, selection for training including apprenticeships, discipline, demotion, termination or retirement; on the basis of race, religion, marital status, age, color, sex, handicap, national origin or ancestry, income level or source of income, arrest record or conviction record, less than honorable discharge, physical appearance, sexual orientation, political beliefs, or student status. 
h.  Harassment or abuse. Every employee shall be treated with dignity and respect. No employee shall be subject to any physical, sexual, psychological, or verbal harassment or abuse. Contractors will not use or tolerate any form of corporal punishment. 
i.  Freedom of association and collective bargaining. Contractors shall recognize and respect the right of employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining. No employee shall be subject to harassment, intimidation or retaliation as a result of their efforts to freely associate or bargain collectively. Contractors and sub-contractors shall not cooperate utilize corrupt with governmental agencies and other organizations that use the power of the state to prevent workers from organizing a union of their choice. Contractors shall allow union organizers free access to employees and shall recognize the union of the employees' choice. In addition to respecting the right of employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining, contractors must source from factories where the above commitment has been demonstrated as exemplified by the following: 
1.  There exist clear channels through which workers can voice their complaints regarding working conditions and such complaints are addressed in a prompt and effective manner; 
2.  The workers have a representative voice in workplace decisions; 
3.  Management negotiates with the workers in good faith. 
j.  Women's rights. Women workers will receive equal remuneration, including benefits; equal treatment; equal evaluation of the quality of their work; and equal opportunity to fill all positions open to male workers. Pregnancy tests will not be a condition of employment, nor will they be demanded of employees. Workers who take maternity leave will not face dismissal nor threat of dismissal, loss of seniority or deduction of wages, and will be able to return to their former employment at the same rate of pay and benefits. Workers will not be forced or pressured to use contraception. Workers will not be exposed to hazards, including glues and solvents, that may endanger their safety, including their reproductive health. Contractors and sub-contractors shall provide appropriate services and accommodation to women workers in connection with pregnancy. 
(3)  Effect of applicable local law. Contractor (and any subcontractors or third party suppliers) must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located. Where there is a conflict between this article and the local laws or regulations, the more strict restriction shall apply. However, where the law conflicts with this article to the extent that the local law is less strict than the minimum standards stated herein, or where adherence to this section would result in a violation of the law of the country or jurisdiction in question, contractors will be deemed in compliance on an existing contract if they take effective actions as determined by the city and/or any monitoring entity acting on behalf of the city, to achieve full compliance with this section to the extent reasonable, considering the applicable laws (see subsection (g)(3)e. regarding nonrenewal when compliance is deemed impossible). 
(4)  Contractors shall refrain from any actions that would diminish the protections afforded by this section. 
(e)  Bid specifications and pre-award procedures.

If the pre-award disclosure reveals a violation of this section or a statement that the proposed contractor will not or cannot comply with this section, the city reserves the right not to award the contract to that contractor. The disclosures shall include: 
a.  The names, addresses, and phone numbers of each facility involved in the production of goods covered by this policy. 
b.  The names, business addresses, and phone numbers of the principal officers of each facility involved in the production of goods covered by this policy.

e.  A sworn statement that each of the proposed production facilities, including any subcontractors, complies with all requirements of this section. 
f.  Any other information deemed necessary by the city for the administration and enforcement of this section. 
(3)  Transparency. Bidders, proposers and contractors shall provide access to the city and the city's independent monitoring agency, if any, to archived and contemporary inspection and monitoring reports for all facilities producing goods for the contract in question and shall require their subcontractors to allow the same access. 
(f)  Requirements for contracts and other procurement arrangements. 
(1)  Mandatory contract language. No contract to which this section applies under subsection (b) shall be entered into by the city unless such contract contains the following language: "The contractor shall follow labor practices consistent with international standards of human rights, meaning that, at a minimum contractor shall adhere to the minimum employment standards found in Section 2-18 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Providence, and shall require all subcontractors and third-party suppliers to do the same. For purposes of Sec. 2-18, "Subcontractor" means a person, partnership, corporation or other entity that enters into a contract with the contractor for performance of some or all of the City-contracted work and includes all third-party suppliers or producers from whom the contractor or its contractors obtains or sources goods, parts or supplies for use on the city contract and is intended to include suppliers at all level of the supply chain. The standards in Sec. 2-18 shall apply in all aspects of the contractor's and subcontractor's operations, including but not limited to, manufacture, assembly, finishing, laundering or dry cleaning, (where applicable), warehouse distribution, and delivery. Contractor acknowledges that by entering into this contract, Contractor shall be subject to all of the requirements and sanctions of Sec. 2-18 of the Code of Ordinances." All applicable contracts must also include the list of sanctions in subsection (g)(3). 
(2)  Inclusion by reference in all contracts. For purposes of carrying out the intent of this section, all provisions of this section are made part of all applicable contracts for procurement under this section. 
(3)  Every contractor and vendor shall bind its contractors and subcontractors, in writing, to the provisions of this section. 
(4)  Continuing disclosure and transparency. All contractors operating under an existing contract applicable under subsection (b), shall submit quarterly sworn disclosure statements containing the information required in subsection (f)(2), to the city or its independent monitoring agency, if any. Disclosures that reveal a violation of this section or statement that contractor will not or cannot comply with this section may be grounds for sanctions without further investigation, or may be investigated for action under this section and the contract. The city and its independent monitoring organization, if any, shall have complete and unfettered access to all contractor's and subcontractor's facilities utilized under a contract to which this section applies. The transparency requirements in subsection (f) above shall continue to apply to contractors under an existing contract. 
(g)  Monitoring and enforcement. 
(1)  Complaints. Any person may complain that one (1) or more standards of this section are being violated. The city and/or any independent monitoring agency acting on behalf of the city shall receive complaints and investigate the merits of such complaints. 
(2)  Independent monitoring agency. The city may choose to contract for investigation and monitoring services with a qualified, independent monitoring agency that is not financed by the industry to which this section applies under subsection (b). The purpose of such arrangement would generally be to receive complaints and provide monitoring, inspection, investigation, and remediation services at locations that are too distant or impractical for the city to do itself. Any such services would be subject to the specific terms of any contract the city makes with the agency. 
(3)  Establishment of consortium. The city shall also explore mechanisms employed by other governmental entities to ensure that businesses that contract with the city are in compliance with this section and any regulations or requirements promulgated in conformance with this section. The mechanisms explored shall include, but not be limited to: 
a.  Establishing working relationships with other public agencies that have enacted sweatfree procurement laws, and advocacy groups, labor organizations and other appropriate entities to share information regarding manufacturers, vendors, and suppliers. 
b.  Developing a sweatfree consortium with other states, cities, school boards, or public entities that allows for cost sharing of monitoring and enforcement activities by a nonprofit independent monitor. 
(4)  Violation, remediation and sanctions. If the city determines there has been a violation of this section, appropriate city staff or the independent monitoring agency, if any, shall inform the contractor of the determination and discuss the violation with the contractor. The purpose of the discussion is to encourage the contractor to change its practices rather than to cease doing business with the contractor. To that end, the city may at its sole option prescribe appropriate measures for the contractor to take in order to comply with this section, however nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the city's remedies under an existing contract or other remedies available at equity or at law. The sanctions for violating this section under an existing contract are as follows and this list of sanctions shall be included in every applicable contract: 
a.  Withholding of payments under an existing contract. 
b.  Liquidated damages. The contractor may be charged liquidated damages on an existing contract of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per violation, or an amount equaling twenty (20) percent of the value of the apparel, garments or corresponding accessories, equipment, materials, or supplies that the city demonstrates were produced in violation of the contract and/or this section per violation; whichever is greater. 
c.  Termination, suspension or cancellation of a contract in whole or in part. 
d.  Nonrenewal when a contract calls for optional renewals. 
e.  Nonrenewal for lack of progress or impossible compliance. The city reserves the right to refuse to renew a contract that calls for optional renewals, when the contractor cannot comply with the minimum standard under (d)(2) and the noncompliance is taking place in a country where: 
1.  Progress toward implementation of the standards in this section is no longer being made; and 
2.  Compliance with the employment standards in this section is deemed impossible by the city and/or any independent monitoring agency acting on behalf of the city. Such determination shall be made in the sole opinion of the city and may be based upon examination of reports from governmental, human rights, labor and business organizations and after consultation with the relevant contractors and subcontractors and any other evidence the city deems reliable. 
f.  Disqualification of the contractor from bidding or submitting proposals on future city contracts, or from eligibility for future city procurements as defined in subsection (b), whether or not formal bidding or requests for proposals are used, for a period of one (1) year after the first violation is found and for a period of three (3) years after a second or subsequent violation is found. The disqualification shall apply to the contractor who committed the violation(s) whether that be under the same corporate name, or as an individual, or under the name of another corporation or business entity of which he or she is a member, partner, officer, or agent. 
(5)  Submission of false information.

(7)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as a limit upon any remedies at law or equity that the city may have to enforce a contractual relationship or otherwise enforce this section. 
(h)  Severability. The provisions of this section shall be severable and if any of the provisions shall be held in contravention of the constitution and laws of the state or of the United States by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the rest of the section shall not be affected.

    Predatory lender means a business entity that has made, within the previous twenty-four-month period, predatory loans that comprise either: 
a.  Five (5) percent of the total annual number of loans made; or 
b.  Twenty-five (25) individual loans; whichever is less. 
Each lender and affiliate shall be considered separately for the purposes of these calculations, and only loans secured by residential real estate that is located within the city shall be considered. The term "predatory lender" shall not include a business entity that has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director of finance that it has discontinued the practice of making predatory loans and has taken steps to ensure that it does not make such loans in the future. 
    Predatory loan means a loan that violates any of the provisions of section 35-25.2-5 or 35-25.2-6 of the General Laws. 
(2)  No bidding bank or savings and loan association may be designated as a city depository if it or any of its affiliates is a predatory lender. Every bidding bank and loan association shall, prior to any such designation, submit to the city an affidavit certifying that neither it, nor any of its affiliates, is a predatory lender.

Sec. 2-18.3. - Investment in manufacturers held liable for causing lead poisoning in the state prohibited. 
(a)  Annually in America, elevated blood lead levels that can cause disabilities, hyperactivity and brain damage, are discovered in over 300,000 children. Paint manufacturers, including Sherwin-Williams, N L Industries, Inc. and Millenium Holdings, LIJC (Glidden), while aware of these effects of lead paint, continued to produce the product for many years before they stopped manufacturing and/or selling it. Lead paint poisoning overwhelmingly affects low income and minority children in particular. Nationally, the cost to cities and others to remove lead paint in housing units is estimated to be over $38 billion, and cities and states do not have enough funds to make all housing units lead safe. In addition, lead poisoning costs the nation $43.4 billion each year in lost wages and health care costs. While this has become a financial burden for the nation, lead paint manufacturers profited from a product that they knew to be dangerous. "The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now" has documented the problem of lead contamination by testing housing units in the city and children with lead poisoning burden our social service programs and public school resources. 
It is not in the interest of the city to invest resources in supporting corporations that engage in business practices that harm the city and its residents, nor is it in the interest of the city to invest resources in firms which are facing a particularly uncertain future because of moral, legal, and regulatory scrutiny of their activities. In light of the fact that Sherwin-Williams Company, N L Industries, Inc. and Millenium Holdings, LLC (Glidden), have been found liable in a major federal lawsuit involving lead paint poisoning of Rhode Island children, the city will not invest any of its moneys or funds, including funds held under the auspices of the city to remain invested, or to be invested in the future, in stocks, securities or other business obligations of the Sherwin-Williams Company, N L Industries, Inc. and Millenium Holdings, LLC (Glidden), or in mutual funds which are major shareholders in any of these companies. 
(b)  The assets of any investment account, including pension, endowment, and annuity funds, under the jurisdiction of the board of investment commissioners and/or the finance director, shall not knowingly be invested in the Sherwin-Williams Company, N L Industries, Inc. and Millenium Holdings, LLC (Glidden), or in any other paint manufacturer subsequently held liable for lead poisoning in the state. 
(c)  The divestiture so required shall be completed within two (2) months of final approval of this section. 
(Ord. 2006, ch. 06-43, §§ 1-3, 9-7-06) 
Sec. 2-18.4. - Participation in Cities for Climate Protection Campaign. 
(a)  The city will participate in the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign and, as a participant, pledges to take a leadership role in promoting public awareness about the causes and impacts of climate change. 
(b)  The city will undertake the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign's five (5) milestones to reduce both greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions throughout the community, and specifically: 
(1)  Conduct a greenhouse gas emissions inventory and forecast to determine the source and quantity of greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdiction; 
(2)  Establish a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target; 
(3)  Develop an action plan with both existing and future actions which when implemented will meet the local greenhouse gas reduction target; 
(4)  Implement the action plan; and 
(5)  Monitor and report progress. 
(c)  The environmental sustainability task force shall study scenarios by which the city shall participate and implement the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign, and shall file written reports to the city council detailing its finding. 
(d)  The city shall, as the need arises, request assistance from ICLEI's Cities for Climate Protection Campaign as it progresses through the milestones.

  The final regular rate received by the employee. 
b.  Treble the damages in subsection a. if the hospitality business employer's violation is shown to be willful. 
(2)  If the employee is the prevailing party in any such legal action, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees and costs as part of the costs recoverable. 
(f)  Severability. The provisions of this section shall be severable. If any provision of this section is held to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, all remaining provisions shall remain in force.

After such hearing is concluded, the city council shall consider and vote upon the following resolution: "Resolved that (insert name of office holder) is no longer fit to hold his or her office and shall be suspended from the office of (insert his or her office)." In the event that two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the entire membership of the city council votes in favor of suspending the convicted office holder from his or her office, the suspension of the convicted office holder shall take effect upon said resolution becoming effective unless the said office holder shall have requested a leave of absence before said effective date.

The commission shall also conduct such consultations and interviews as the members thereof may deem necessary, shall provide the mayor or member of the city council with a hearing, at which said official shall have the right to be represented by counsel, and report to the council within seven (7) calendar days as to whether, in their judgment, the mayor or council person should be declared incapable of exercising his or her powers and duties, and if he or she is incapable, whether such incapacity appears to be temporary or permanent. 
(c)  The city council upon receiving the report of the commission shall meet forthwith, in regular or special meeting, and shall take up the report and recommendations of the commission. If the city council concurs in a finding of incapacity by a vote of two-thirds of the entire membership of the council, the mayor shall be declared suspended from office and the council president shall serve as acting mayor until the incapacity of the mayor shall have been declared by a two-thirds vote of the entire membership of the council, with the advice of the commission, to have terminated, or the office of mayor or council person shall have been declared by a two-thirds vote of the entire membership of the council, with the advice of the commission, to have been vacated by virtue of permanent incapacity and a successor elected. 
(6)  If the office of mayor becomes vacant for any of the reasons set forth in Subsection 206(a) or Section 208 of the Charter, or if the mayor takes a leave of absence from his office, or is suspended from office pursuant to paragraph (2) hereof, or is adjudged by the council to be unable to perform the duties of his or her office by virtue of physical or mental illness pursuant to paragraph (5) hereof, the powers and duties of the office of mayor shall be exercised by the president of the city council, who shall be deemed the acting mayor, until the vacancy in the office of mayor shall have been filled pursuant to Subsection 206(a) of the Charter, or the term of the mayor shall have expired, and a successor duly elected and qualified, or his or her absence or disability terminated. All acts performed by the president of the city council when acting as mayor as aforesaid shall have the same force and validity as if performed by the mayor.

Sec. 2-169. - Official capital improvement program 1990-1995. 
(a)  Objectives of the capital improvement program: 
(1)  To improve financial management of the city's capital resources; 
(2)  To maintain a high credit rating for Providence, thereby lowering interest costs; 
(3)  To continue stimulation of private investment; 
(4)  To insure that capital projects and comprehensive planning are based on Providence's long-range fiscal potential; 
(5)  To advocate a regular preventive maintenance program that would result in tax savings and lower capital improvement costs; 
(6)  To guide implementation of Providence's development programs. 
(b)  Purpose. The capital improvement program is the primary management guide for allocation of limited city resources for physical improvements over the next five (5) years. It helps use those resources to achieve overall goals in providing city services and in developing neighborhoods, the downtown, and the city's economy in general. The capital improvement program outlines costs and funding alternatives involved in implementing the city's ongoing comprehensive plan. It thereby insures that the comprehensive plan reflects financial realities. 
    Other purposes of the capital improvement program are: 
(1)  Annual review of priorities. At both department and citywide levels, yearly review of priorities ensures that funding decisions adjust to changing circumstances. 
(2)  Joint project coordination. Savings, in time or money, or increased project impact can result from coordinating projects of different agencies with respect to location, function and timing. 
(3)  Stimulation of private investment. A readily available schedule of future public improvements encourages private residential, commercial and industrial investments. 
(4)  Lower cost credit. Evidence of prudent, long-range financial planning is important to credit rating services. Better knowledge of needs and resources will improve Providence's flexibility during money market fluctuations. 
(5)  Neighborhood participation. By opening capital improvement funding decisions to continuous public debate, on a citywide basis, the capital improvement program limits the influence of pressure groups that might otherwise obtain commitments for a disproportionate share of city resources. At the same time, neighborhood groups have the opportunity to react to city departments proposals, submit their own projects for review, or identify gaps in service or development plans. 
(c)  Definition of capital improvements: 
(1)  New construction, reconstruction, substantial alterations and extraordinary repairs; 
(2)  Acquisition of real property or interest therein; 
(3)  Designs or preliminary studies or surveys relative to subsections (1) and (2) above; 
(4)  Acquisition and installation of equipment and furnishings relative to subsections (1) and (2) above.

(Ord. 1935, ch. 909, § 1; Rev. Ords. 1946, ch. 13, § 23; Ord. 1949, ch. 216, § 1) 
Sec. 2-309. - Material and proportions of national flag. 
    The flag of the United States, referred to as the national flag and also known as the Stars and Stripes, shall be of suitable material and of the proportions designated by executive order of the President of the United States. The size of the national flag shall be the same as that of the post flag of the United States Army. 
(Ord. 1941, ch. 1058, § 3; Rev. Ords. 1946, ch. 13, § 3) 
Sec. 2-310. - Position and use of national flag. 
    The national flag represents the living country and is considered as a living thing, the union being the honor point. The right arm is the sword arm and therefore the point of danger; hence, the right is the place of honor. The edge of the flag which is toward the staff is the heraldic dexter or right edge. The union of the flag, and the flag itself when in company with other flags, shall always be given the honor point, i.e., the marching right, the flag's own right, or an observer's left. When the national flag is carried, as in a procession, with another flag or with other flags, the place of the national flag shall be on the marching right, i.e., the left of an observer when the flag is approaching. When the national flag and another flag are displayed together from crossed staffs, as against a wall, the national flag shall be on the right, i.e., the flag's own right, or the left of an observer facing the wall, and its staff shall be in front of the staff of the other flag. When a number of flags are grouped and displayed from staffs the national flag shall be in the center, or at the highest point, of the group. When the national flag is hung either horizontally or vertically against a wall the union shall be uppermost and to the flag's own right, i.e., to the observer's left. In general, the national flag should be hung flat. It should not be festooned over doorways or arches, tied in a bowknot, or fashioned into a rosette. When used on a rostrum it should be displayed above and behind the speaker's desk. It should never be used to cover the speaker's desk or draped over the front of the platform. For this latter purpose, as well as for decoration in general, bunting of the national colors should be used, and, since the union of the flag always goes to the honor right, the colors should be arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below. No lettering or object of any kind shall be placed on the national flag. No flag or pennant shall be flown above the national flag. 
(Ord. 1941, ch. 1058, § 10; Rev. Ords. 1946, ch. 13, § 10) 
Sec. 2-311. - National flag to be flown on city hall; size and equipment. 
    During every national legal holiday, during every state legal holiday, during parades and during days and occasions the mayor or the city council may direct and order, but in no event longer than sunrise to sunset, the city sergeant shall cause a national flag to be flown over the main entrance of the city hall facing Exchange Place. The size of said national flag shall be the same as that of the United States Army national recruiting flag, five feet hoist by nine feet six inches fly. This flag may be equipped with a lath encased in the center stripe or device to prevent the flag from wrapping around the staff when displayed. 
(Ord. 1941, ch. 1058, § 8; Rev. Ords. 1946, ch. 13, § 7) 
Sec. 2-312. - Not more than one national flag on city hall. 
    Not more than one national flag or color shall be flown at the same time from the roof of the city hall. 
(Ord. 1941, ch. 1058, § 7; Rev. Ords. 1946, ch. 13, § 8) 
Sec. 2-313. - National flags used by departments. 
    Every board, commission and department head, who has jurisdiction of public parks, playgrounds, recreation fields, public buildings or other city property where the national flag is flown, shall be the custodian and keeper of the national flag or flags used by his or its respective departments. Said boards, commissions and department heads shall cause all such flags and colors to be kept clean and in good order and shall cause said flags and colors to be repaired and replaced with new ones when the occasion demands it. The cost of said repairs and replacements shall be charged to the respective appropriations for their respective departments. Said boards, commissions and department heads shall cause the national flag to be flown or displayed in said parks, playgrounds, recreation fields and on public buildings, under their respective jurisdiction, during every national legal holiday, during every state legal holiday and on days or occasions the mayor, the city council or said boards, commissions and department heads may direct and order, but in no event longer than sunrise to sunset.

(Ord. 1914, ch. 47, § 4; Rev. Ords. 1946, ch. 13, § 25) 
Sec. 2-315. - Display of national flag at half-staff. 
    No national flag, under the jurisdiction of any department head, board or commission of the city, as provided in this article, shall be displayed at half-staff unless explicitly so ordered by the mayor or the city council. On such occasions as the mayor or the city council may order the national flag to be displayed at half-staff it shall be first hoisted to the top of the staff and then lowered to the half-staff position. Before lowering the flag it shall be again raised to the top of the staff. Below the top of the staff (chock-a-block) is technically the half-staff position, but, in general, the middle point of the hoist of a flag at half-staff should, in the case of an unguyed flagstaff of one piece, be halfway between the top of the staff and the foot thereof, or, in the case of a flagstaff with crosstree or guy cables, halfway between the top of the staff and the crosstree or point of attachment of the guy cables. Local conditions, such as the liability of fouling the flag, may however, dictate other positions, a graceful one being with the top of the flag the depth of the hoist below the top of the staff. 
(Ord. 1941, ch. 1058, § 11; Rev. Ords. 1946, ch. 13, § 11) 
Sec. 2-316. - Lowering and folding national flag. 
    When the national flag is lowered from the staff, no portion of it shall be allowed to touch the ground, either in lowering or in folding. Before being completely detached from the halyards the flag should be folded into the shape of a cocked hat.

Sec. 2-317. - Sockets in sidewalks for display of national flag. 
    For the purpose of providing for a uniform display of the United States flag on certain days, the owner or lessee of any property within the city is hereby authorized to install in the sidewalk in front of his premises one foot from the face of the curb, at intervals of approximately twenty-five feet, sockets of such design and installed in such manner as shall be approved by the director of public works. 
(Ord. 1925, ch. 492, § 1; Rev. Ords. 1946, ch. 13, § 22) 
Sec. 2-318. - Approval of installation of sockets; responsibility for damage; removal of sockets. 
    No person shall install any socket in the sidewalk of any public highway without the approval of the director of public works, and no person shall use any such socket for holding any staff, banner or device of any kind except a staff from which shall be displayed the flag of the United States, nor use such socket for the display of the flag of the United States except on the days and hours herein authorized. Such owner or lessee shall be responsible to the city for any and all damages suffered by it in consequence of damages to persons or property by reason of any negligence or defect in the construction of such sockets, or for allowing the same to be or remain out of repair. The director of public works is hereby authorized to cause such sockets or any of them to be removed, if in his opinion their condition at any time render the sidewalks dangerous. 
(Ord. 1925, ch. 492, § 3; Rev. Ords. 1946, ch. 13, § 24)

There shall be no right or wrong side nor front or back to the city flag. It shall be customary, however, when describing the flag always to place the heading, tabling, staff or pike to the heraldic dexter or right (observer's left). The size of the city flag shall be four feet four inches on the pike and five feet six inches fly and shall be carried on a suitable wooden pike nine feet six inches in length inclusive of the staff head and ferrule.

To obtain approval applicants must demonstrate compliance with all policy, standards and requirements of this article to the satisfaction of the building official or his/her designee. Applicants may demonstrate compliance via submission of materials and documentation including but not limited to a stormwater management plan, site plan, and maintenance agreement in accordance with this article. Plans will be reviewed in conjunction with site plan review by the planning board. 
(Ord. 2005, ch. 05-54, § 1, 12-1-05) 
Sec. 5-85. - Technical standards. 
    All applicants are required to develop and submit a stormwater management plan. All stormwater management plans must address stormwater management on a site-by-site basis and all requirements of this article. All stormwater management practices shall be consistent with the "Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual" and the "Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook," as amended. 
(1)  Performance standards. Stormwater management plans shall incorporate best management practices (BMPs) for water quality control, which in combination are demonstrated to reduce the average annual total suspended solids in post-development runoff by eighty (80) percent. Development in drinking water supply watersheds or watersheds where impaired waters as defined by the state's 303(d) list exist may be held to higher standards. 
(2)  Disallowed stormwater best management practices (BMPs). The placement of detention basins and other stormwater structures within a floodplain shall be avoided. If there is no alternative, the applicant must show what effects, if any, the tailwaters created by the floodplain will have on the outflow and effective storage capacity of the detention facility. 
(3)  Facilitation of maintenance. Facilities that require maintenance shall be designed to minimize the need for regular maintenance, facilitate required maintenance, and ensure accessibility of components that require maintenance. At a minimum, all stormwater management plans must incorporate BMPs with appropriate maintenance design in accordance with the "Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual," as amended; or the "Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook," as amended. 
(4)  Flood protection. Stormwater management plans shall demonstrate that a proposed project provides for protection of life and property from flooding and flood flows. Water quantities must be controlled in accordance with the "Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual," as amended, or a municipally approved regional stormwater management plan for the watershed in which the project site is located. Stormwater management plans shall demonstrate incorporation of the following standards into the proposed project: 
a.  Control and maintenance of post-development peak discharge rates from the two-year, ten-year, twenty-five-year, and one hundred-year storm events and predevelopment levels. 
b.  Downstream analysis of the one hundred-year storm event and control of the peak discharge rate for the one hundred-year storm to mitigate significant downstream impacts. 
c.  Discharge from any stormwater facility must be conveyed through properly constructed conveyance system to provide for non-erosive flows during all storm events. The proposed stormwater conveyance system consisting of open channels, pipes, and other conveyance devices shall at a minimum accommodate the runoff from a twenty-five-year storm event. The stormwater conveyance system must provide for non-erosive flows to receiving waters. 
(5)  Surface water and groundwater. Stormwater management plans shall demonstrate that during development and post-development, all receiving waters will be recharged in a manner closely resembling predevelopment conditions and that the developed site will retain hydrologic conditions that closely resemble those prior to disturbance. Predevelopment conditions are defined as those conditions existing at the site (precursor to the currently proposed development) at the time of adoption of this article. For redevelopment of previously developed sites, every effort shall be made to model the conditions prior to the presence of non-permeable surfaces (building or infrastructure) and/or fill. 
(Ord. 2005, ch. 05-54, § 1, 12-1-05) 
Sec. 5-86. - Maintenance requirements for best management practices (BMPs). 
(a)  Routine maintenance and repair procedures. Preventative maintenance procedures are required to maintain the intended operation and safe condition of the stormwater management facility by greatly reducing the occurrence of problems and malfunctions. To be effective, preventative maintenance shall be performed on a regular basis and include such routine procedures as training of staff, periodic inspections, grass cutting elimination of mosquito breeding habitats, and pond maintenance. Disposal of sediment and debris must occur on a regular basis (unless otherwise specified within an approved plan), at suitable disposal sites or recycling sites and shall comply with applicable local, state and federal regulations. Corrective maintenance procedures are required to correct a problem or malfunction at a stormwater management facility and to restore the facility's intended operation and safe condition. Based upon the severity of the problem, corrective maintenance must be performed on an as-needed or emergency basis and include such procedures as structural repairs, removal of debris, sediment and trash removal, erosion repair, snow and ice removal, fence repair, mosquito extermination, and restoration of vegetated and non-vegetated linings. 
(b)  General maintenance standards for stormwater best management practices (BMPs). Maintenance design and maintenance procedures for all stormwater BMPs shall be in accordance with the "Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual," as amended, or the "Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook," as amended as well as in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Stormwater management plans shall demonstrate appropriate maintenance design and procedures for each proposed best management practice. A maintenance schedule for each type of BMP must be included in the stormwater management plan. These schedules shall list the frequency and type of maintenance operations necessary along with the legally responsible party's name, address, and telephone number. If the stormwater drainage facility is to be deeded to the city the applicant must obtain a letter from the city or its designee acknowledging maintenance responsibility and intent of ownership.

Secs. 5-91-5-100. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VII. - SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 

Sec. 5-101. - Purpose. 
    The city council hereby finds that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing development for non-agricultural uses such as housing developments, industrial areas, recreational facilities and roads. This erosion makes necessary costly repairs to gullies, washed out fills, roads, and embankments. The resulting sediment clogs the stormwaters and road ditches, muddies streams, and deposits silt in ponds and reservoirs. Sediment is considered a major water pollutant. 
    The purpose of this article is to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation from occurring as a result of non-agricultural development within the city by requiring proper provisions for water disposal, construction waste disposal and the protection of soil surfaces during and after construction, in order to promote the safety, public health and general welfare of the city. 
(Ord. 2005, ch. 05-55, § 1, 12-1-05) 
Sec. 5-102. - Applicability. 
    This article shall be applicable to any situation involving any disturbance to the terrain, topsoil or vegetative ground cover upon any property within the city after determination of applicability by the building official or his/her designee based upon criteria outlined in section 5-103 below. Compliance with the requirements as described herein shall not be construed to relieve the owner/applicant of any obligations to obtain necessary state or federal permits. 
(Ord. 2005, ch. 05-55, § 1, 12-1-05) 
Sec. 5-103. - Determination of applicability. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to disturb any existing vegetation, grades, and contours of land in a manner, which may increase the potential for soil erosion without first applying for a determination of applicability from the building official or his/her designee. Upon determination of applicability, the owner/applicant shall submit a soil erosion and sediment control plan for approval by the building official or his/her designee, as provided in section 5-104. The application for determination of applicability shall describe the location, nature, character, and time schedule of the proposed land disturbing activity in sufficient detail to allow the building official or his/her designee to determine the potential for soil erosion and sedimentation resulting from the proposed project. In determining the applicability of the soil erosion and sediment control ordinance to a particular land disturbing activity, the building official or his/her designee shall consider site topography, drainage patterns, soils, proximity to watercourses, and other such information as deemed appropriate by the building official or his/her designee. A particular land disturbing activity shall not be subject to the requirements of this article if the building official or his/her designee finds that erosion resulting from the land disturbing activity is insignificant and represents no threat to adjacent properties or to the quality of any coastal feature or watercourse, as defined herein. The current "Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook," U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service, state department of environmental management, and state conservation committee shall be consulted in making this determination. 
    No determination of applicability shall be required for the following: 
(1)  Construction, alternation or use of any additions to existing single family or duplex homes or related structures, provided the grounds coverage of such addition is less than one-quarter (1/4) acre, and such construction, alteration and use does not occur within one hundred (100) feet of any watercourse or coastal feature, and the slopes at the site of land disturbance do not exceed ten (10) percent. 
(2)  Use of a home or community garden. 
(3)  Excavations for improvements other than those described in subsection (1) above which exhibit all of the following characteristics: 
a.  Does not result in a total displacement of more than fifty (50) cubic yards of material; and 
b.  Has no slopes steeper than ten (10) feet vertical in one hundred (100) feet horizontal or approximately ten (10) percent; and 
c.  Have all disturbed surface areas promptly and effectively protected to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation. 
(4)  Grading, as a maintenance measure, or for landscaping purposes on existing developed land parcels or lots, provided that all bare surfaces are immediately seeded, sodded or otherwise protected from erosive actions and all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The aggregate of areas of such activity does not exceed two thousand (2,000) square feet; and 
b.  The change of elevation does not exceed two (2) feet at any point; and 
c.  The grading does not involve a quantity of fill greater than eighteen (18) cubic yards; except where fill is excavated from another portion of the same parcel and the quantity does not exceed fifty (50) cubic yards. 
(5)  Grading, filling, removal, or excavation activities and operations undertaken by the city under the direction and supervision of the director of public works for work on streets, roads, or right-of-way dedicated to public use, provided, however, that adequate and acceptable erosion and sediment controls are incorporated in engineering plans and specifications are employed. Appropriate controls shall apply during construction as well as after the completion of these activities. All such work shall be undertaken in accordance with the performance principles provided for in subsection 5-105(c) and such standards and definitions as may be adopted to implement said performance principles.

(2)  Expert opinion. The official or his/her designee, the zoning board of review or other board of review, may seek technical assistance on any soil erosion and sediment control plan. The expert opinion must be made available in the office of the building official or his/her designee as a public record prior to the appeals hearing. 
(Ord. 2005, ch. 05-55, § 1, 12-1-05) 
Sec. 5-105. - Soil erosion and sediment control plan. 
(a)  Plan preparation. The erosion and sediment control plan shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer, or certified landscape architect or a soil and water conservation society certified erosion and sediment control specialist. Five (5) copies of the plan shall be submitted to the building official or his/her designee. 
(b)  Plan contents. The erosion and sediment control plan shall include sufficient information about the proposed activities and land parcels(s) to form a clear basis for discussion and review and to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of this article. The plan shall be consistent with the data collection, data analysis, and plan preparation guidelines in the current "Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook," prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, state department of environmental management, and state conservation committee. At a minimum, the plan shall contain: 
(1)  A narrative describing the proposed land disturbing activity with the soil erosion and sediment control measures and stormwater management measures to be installed to control erosion that could result from the proposed activity. Supporting documentation, such as a drainage area, existing site, and soil maps shall be provided as required by the building official or his/her designee. 
(2)  Construction drawings illustrating, in detail, existing and proposed contours, drainage features, and vegetation; limits of clearing and grading, the location of soil erosion and sediment control and stormwater management measures, detail drawings of measures; stockpiles and borrow areas; sequence and staging of land disturbing activities; and other such information needed for construction. 
(3)  Other information or construction plans and details as deemed necessary by the building official or his/her designee for thorough review of the plan prior to action being taken as prescribed in this article. Withholding or delay of such information may cause the building official or his/her designee to judge the application as incomplete and may constitute grounds for disapproval. 
(c)  Performance principles. The contents of the erosion and sediment control plan shall clearly demonstrate how the principles, outlined below, have been met in the project design and are to be accomplished by the proposed development. 
(1)  The site selected shall show due regard for natural drainage characteristics and topography. 
(2)  To the extent possible, steep slopes shall be avoided. 
(3)  The grade of slopes created shall be minimized. 
(4)  Post development runoff rates should not exceed predevelopment rates, consistent with other stormwater requirements which may be in effect. Increases in stormwater runoff shall be retained and recharged as close as feasible to its place of origin by means of detention ponds or basins, seepage areas, subsurface drains, infiltration chambers, porous paving, or similar technique. 
(5)  Original boundaries, alignment, and slopes of water-courses within the project locus shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible. 
(6)  In general, drainage shall be directed away from structures intended for human occupancy, municipal or utility use, or similar structures. 
(7)  All drainage provisions shall be of such a design and capacity so as to adequately handle stormwater runoff, including runoff from tributary upstream areas, which may be outside the locus of the project. 
(8)  Drainage facilities and controls shall be installed as early as feasible during construction, prior to site clearance, if possible. 
(9)  Fill adjacent to water courses should be avoided. If there is no viable alternative, fill shall be protected from erosion. Vegetative stabilization with minimal rip-rap and/or gabions is the preferred method. Vertical structures, including retaining walls, should not be used unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate there will be no adverse impacts resulting from this method of stabilization. 
(10)  Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect bare areas and stockpiles from erosion during construction; the smallest areas feasible shall be exposed at any one (1) time; disturbed areas shall be protected during the non-growing months, November through March. 
(11)  Permanent vegetation shall be placed immediately following final grading. 
(12)  Trees and other existing vegetation shall be retained whenever feasible; the area within the dripline shall be fenced or roped off to protect trees from construction equipment. 
(13)  In the city's residential neighborhoods, it is strongly recommended that sidewalks should be separated from the curb by a permeable strip whenever possible, provided there is a uniform appearance. The permeable strip shall be soil, mulch, vegetation or porous paving. At no time should the sidewalk be less than four (4) feet. Sidewalks in excess of six (6) feet in width are strongly discouraged under normal circumstances. 
(14)  All areas damaged during construction shall be resodded, reseeded, or otherwise restored. Monitoring and maintenance schedules, where required, shall be predetermined. 
(15)  All construction wastes shall be handled, stored, and disposed of in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal laws.

ARTICLE IX. - SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS 

Sec. 5-120. - Purpose and application. 
    The purpose of this article is to ensure public safety; minimize hazards to persons and property from flooding, to protect watercourses from encroachment, and to maintain the capability of floodplains to retain and carry off floodwaters. The City of Providence elects to comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). 
    The special flood hazard areas are herein established as a floodplain overlay district. The district includes all special flood hazard areas within the City of Providence designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A99, V, or VE on the Providence County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Digital FIRM issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the administration of the National Flood Insurance Program. The map panels of the Providence County FIRM that are wholly or partially within the City of Providence are panel numbers 44007C0302H, 44007C0303H, 44007C0304J, 44007C0306H, 44007C0307J, 44007C0308J, 44007C0309K, 44007C0311H, and 44007C0312H, all dated October 2, 2015; panel number 44007C0316G, dated March 2, 2009; panel number 44007C0317, dated September 18, 2013; and panel numbers 44007C0318H, 44007C0319H, 44007C0326H, and 44007C0328H, dated October 2, 2015. The exact boundaries of the district may be defined by the 100-year base flood elevations shown on the FIRM and further defined by the Providence County Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report dated October 2, 2015. The department of planning and development is responsible for floodplain management. The FIRM and FIS report and any revisions and amendments thereto are incorporated herein by reference and are on file with the city clerk, department of planning and development, building official, Providence Emergency Management Agency, and department of inspection and standards.

(a)  Building permit . 
(1)  All proposed construction or other development within a special flood hazard area shall require a permit. 
(2)  The National Flood Insurance Program Special Flood Hazard Area requires permits for all projects that meet the definition of development, not just "building" projects. Development projects include any filling, grading, excavation, mining, drilling, storage of materials, temporary stream crossings. If the construction or other development within a special flood hazard area is not covered by a building permit, all other non-structural activities shall be permitted by either the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council and/or the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management as applicable. Therefore if another state agency issues a permit, the local building official shall have the opportunity for input and keep a copy of the respective permit in their files. 
(3)  Prior to the issuance of a building or development permit, the applicant shall submit evidence that all necessary permits and approvals have been received from all government agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law. 
(4)  A permit fee (based on the cost of the construction) may be required to be paid to the City of Providence and a copy of a receipt for the same shall accompany the application. An additional fee may be charged if the code enforcement officer and/or board of appeals need the assistance of a professional engineer. 
(b)  Disclaimer of liability . The degree of flood protection required by the article is considered reasonable but does not imply total flood protection. 
(c)  Severability . If any section, provision, or portion of this article is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court, the remainder of the article shall not be affected. 
(d)  Abrogation and greater restriction . This section shall not in any way impair/remove the necessity of compliance with any other applicable laws, ordinances, regulations, etc. Where this article imposes a greater restriction, the provisions of this section shall control. 
(e)  Enforcement . The building official shall enforce all provisions as applicable in reference to R.I.G.L. § 23-27.3-108.1. 
(f)  Penalties . Every person who violates any provision of this section shall be subject to penalties put forth in R.I.G.L. § 23-27.3-122.3.

    Floodway. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. For the purposes of these regulations, the term "regulatory floodway" is synonymous in meaning with the term "floodway". 
    Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent use or facility. A use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities.

    Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    Manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision. A parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value. Market value is the price of a structure that a willing buyer and seller agree upon. This can be determined by an independent appraisal by a professional appraiser; the property's tax assessment, minus land value; the replacement cost minus depreciation of the structure; the structure's actual cash value. 
    New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard". 
    Start of construction. For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, substantial improvement or other improvement was within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erections of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure. For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. For insurance purposes, means: 
(1)  A building with two (2) or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; 
(2)  A manufactured home ("a manufactured home," also known as a mobile home, is a structure built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one (1) or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or 
(3)  A travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. 
    For the latter purpose, "structure" does not mean recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in subsection (3) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage . Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement . Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvements to a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)  Any project to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of the "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Variance . A grant of relief from the terms of this article IX that allows construction in a manner otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    Violation . Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management ordinance. Construction or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, flood-proofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 9-78. - Self-service motor fuel dispensing stations. 
    Definition; regulatory provisions. Self-service stations are defined as "that portion of property where flammable and combustible liquids used as motor fuels are stored, and subsequently dispensed from fixed equipment into the fuel tanks of motor vehicles by persons other than service station attendants, and shall include facilities available for the sale of other retail products," and the operation of such stations shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  Self-service dispensers: A remote controlled dispensing device approved by the authority having jurisdiction. The coin and/or the card operated type are not acceptable in the City of Providence. 
(b)  Attendant required: All self-service stations shall have at least one qualified attendant on duty while the station is open to the public. During all times that class 1 liquids are actually being dispensed, the attendant's primary function shall be to supervise, observe and control the dispensing of said liquids. It shall be the responsibility of the attendant to prevent the dispensing of class 1 liquids into portable containers unless the container is constructed of metal or approved plastic, or is approved by the authority having jurisdiction, has a tight closure with screwed or spring cover, and is fitted with a spout or so designed that the contents can be poured without spilling. It shall also be the responsibility of the attendant to control sources of ignition, and to immediately handle accidental spills and fire extinguishers if needed. The attendant or supervisor on duty shall be capable of performing the functions and assuming the responsibilities covered in this section. 
(c)  Attendant's control and supervision: At self-service stations, the attendant shall be required to remain within arm's length distance of the remote controlled console, at all times while class 1 liquids are being dispensed. A "post-payment operation" is advocated to insure the attendant's compliance with the foregoing provision. 
(d)  Emergency controls: 
(1)  A main power shut-off switch or switches shall be installed at a location not more than fifteen (15) feet from the attendant's principal control location, and not more than one hundred (100) feet from the dispensers. 
(2)  A fixed fire extinguisher system suitable for the extinguishment of class B (flammable liquid) fires, acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction, and covering the entire gasoline dispensing area, shall be installed at each self-service station. Said system shall be capable of being activated, either manually or automatically; however, if it is to be activated manually, the triggering device shall not be more than fifteen (15) feet from the attendant's principal control location and not more than one hundred (100) feet from the dispensers. Activation of the fixed fire protection system shall automatically shut off the power supply to the dispensing devices on the island involved. 
"The entire gasoline dispensing area" referred to above is construed to mean the area encompassing the self-service island. If however, an adjacent attended island (normally serviced by a regular attendant dispensing motor fuel) is in too close proximity to the self-service island in the opinion of the authority having jurisdiction, then a fixed fire protection system may be required there also. 
(e)  Operation instructions: Instructions for the operation of the dispensers shall be conspicuously posted on either the dispenser or the dispenser island. 
(f)  Emergency procedures: A list of emergency procedures and instructions shall be conspicuously posted at the immediate vicinity of the attendant's principal control location. 
(g)  Clear observation: The dispensing operation shall at all times be in clear view of the attendant, and the placing or allowing of any obstacle to come between the dispensing operation and the attendant, so as to obstruct the attendant's view, is prohibited. 
(h)  Delivery nozzles: Hose nozzle valves used at self-service islands shall be an approved automatic closing type without a latch-open device. 
(i)  Voice communication control: A voice communication system, such as, but not limited to, an intercom system, so as to allow direct voice communication at all times between the person dispensing the fuel and the attendant, shall be required. 
(j)  Warning sign: On each and every dispenser island shall be conspicuously posted, the following words of warning: 
(1)  WARNING ... IT IS UNLAWFUL TO DISPENSE GASOLINE INTO ANY PORTABLE CONTAINER UNLESS THE CONTAINER IS CONSTRUCTED OF METAL OR IS APPROVED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. 
(2)  NO SMOKING. 
(3)  SHUT OFF MOTOR WHILE MOTOR FUEL IS BEING DISPENSED.

Sec. 9-94. - Excessive avoidable false fire alarm fees. 
(a)  Findings. 
(1)  The city council finds that high incidence of false alarms and/or malfunctions causes a significant diversion of the manpower and resources of the fire department by causing the dispatch of units to the scene of a false alarm or alarm malfunction which renders them out of service and unavailable to respond to legitimate emergency situations. 
(2)  The city council finds that the continued high incidence of false alarms and/or malfunctions are a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(3)  The city council finds that a revision of the procedures to control excessive multiple false alarms and alarm malfunctions would serve the public health, safety and welfare. 
(b)  Definitions. 
    Avoidable false alarm means the activation of any alarm which results in the response of the fire department and is caused by the negligence or intentional misuse (including such activation caused by heat, smoke or fire) of the system by the owner or his/her/its employees, servants, agents or guests or any other activation including activation caused by heat, smoke or fire, but shall exclude a false alarm malfunction as defined below. 
    Avoidable fire alarm malfunction means the activation of any alarm which results in the response of the fire department and such activation is caused by mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or lack of proper maintenance; and for any other response for which the fire department personnel are unable to gain access to the premises for any reason, or are unable to determine, after reasonable inquiry, the apparent cause of the alarm activation. 
(c)  The owner of any premises shall be responsible for any avoidable false alarms and avoidable false alarm malfunctions occurring at those premises. Incidents shall be cumulative for all realty held in that name, and fines for avoidable false alarms and avoidable false alarm malfunctions will be assessed to the owner of the premises according to the following fine schedule: 
Incidents Fees 0-3 $0.00 4-10 150.00 10-30 200.00 per incident In excess of 50 300.00 per incident  
(d)  After three (3) avoidable false alarms or avoidable false alarm malfunctions in one (1) twelve-month period, the owner of the premises will be notified via first class mail that subsequent avoidable false alarms will cause the owner to be assessed fines according to the fine schedule included in this section. 
(e)  A grievance board will be formed consisting of two (2) members of the city police department designated by the chief of police, two (2) members of the city fire department designated by the fire chief, one (1) member of the city council designated by the president of the council, and two (2) members of the Alarm Association of Rhode Island designated by the alarm association, to review any appeals related to the enforcement of false alarms. If an alarm user has a grievance with the city police or fire departments, the user must have his or her alarm servicing company transmit a letter to the grievance board verifying that the alarm company is making every effort to resolve the false alarm problem. The board shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations as needed.

    For the purposes of this article the following definitions shall apply: 
(a)  Buildings. The term "buildings" shall mean any structure whether public or private, that is adapted for occupancy, for transaction of business, for rendering of professional services, for amusement, for the display, sale or storage of goods, wares or merchandise, or for the performance of work or labor, including hotels, apartment buildings, tenement houses, rooming houses, office buildings, public buildings, stores, theatres, markets, restaurants, grain elevators, abattoirs, warehouses, workshops, factories and all outhouses, sheds, barns and other structures on premises used for business purposes. 
(b)  Ratproofing. The term "ratproofing" as used herein applies to a form of construction to prevent the ingress of rats into buildings from the exterior or from one (1) building or establishment to another. It consists essentially of treating all actual or potential openings in the exterior wall, grounds or first floors, basements, roof and foundations, that may be reached by rats from the ground by climbing or by burrowing, with material impervious to rat gnawing. 
(c)  Rat harborage. The term "rat harborage" shall mean any condition which provides shelter or protection for rats, thus favoring their multiplication and continued existence in, under or outside of a structure of any kind. 
(d)  Rat eradication. The term "rat eradication" means the elimination or extermination of rats within buildings so that the buildings are completely freed of rats or there is no evidence of rat infestation remaining, by any or all of the accepted measures, such as poisoning, fumigation, trapping, clubbing, etc. 
(e)  Owner. The term "owner" shall mean the actual owner of the business building, whether individual, partnership, or corporation, or the agent of the building, or other person having custody of the building or to whom rent is paid. In the case of business buildings leased with a clause in the lease specifying that the lessee is responsible for maintenance and repairs, the lessee will be considered in such cases as the "owner" for the purpose of this article. 
(f)  Occupant. The term "occupant" as used herein shall mean the individual, partnership, or corporation that has the use of or occupies any business building or part or fraction thereof, whether the actual owner or tenant.

(b)  The owner of any premises which allows said premises to be infested by rodents or other vermin shall be deemed to have created an unsanitary condition and a nuisance. Premises shall be rebuttably deemed to be "infested by rodents," whenever an inspection of the premises reveals rodent holes, droppings, carcasses or other evidence, that manifests based on the totality of the circumstances, the existence of rodent habitation as opposed to mere rodent trespass. Observations may be made by individuals who, based upon their training and experience, possess sufficient knowledge of animal behavior so as to discriminate between evidence of rodent infestation from evidence of activity by animals other than rodents. Upon determination that any such premises are rodent infested, the director of public works or his or her designee shall order the abatement of the same within seventy-two (72) hours. In the event that such abatement does not occur, or that the owner does not otherwise comply with the order of the director, the director shall abate the nuisance and shall lien the premises for the costs of said abatement. Provided, however, in order to facilitate the promotion of the public health, the director may design a program wherein, and upon the execution by the owner of a form of consent within seven (7) days of notification of said nuisance by the director, the director may, at the city's costs, provide required baiting. The director may provide baiting for not more than two (2) instances of rodent nuisance. For the purposes of such a program, execution of form of consent for the initial two (2) instances shall be presumptively deemed to be abatement of the determined nuisance.

It shall be unlawful for the owner, lessee or occupier of any parcel of real property to cause or to allow to exist said public nuisance on any parcel of real property he or she owns, leases or occupies. Any person found in violation of this section shall subject to a fine pursuant to section 1-10 of the Providence Code of Ordinances.

Notice shall also be mailed, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of record of said property according to the tax assessor's records. The notice shall contain the address of the property, notify the person receiving notice that the property is in violation of this article of the Code of Ordinances of the city describe generally, the nature of the violation and notify the recipient that he or she shall have five (5) days from the date of the notice within which to abate the nuisance.

All costs incurred by the city in abating the nuisance shall be reimbursed by the owner, lessee, or occupier of the land. 
(f)  Lien for abatement costs and fines. Any unpaid fines imposed pursuant to this article and costs incurred by the city in abating a stagnant water nuisance pursuant to subsection (e) shall constitute a lien on the property, which shall be recorded in the land evidence records of the city, and shall be discharged only upon payment of all fines and costs imposed pursuant to this article.

(9)  If, it is determined after a good faith effort made by the lender/mortgagee at the conciliation conference with the homeowner/mortgagor, that the parties cannot come to an agreement to re-negotiate the terms of the loan in an effort to avoid foreclosure, such good faith effort on behalf of the lender/mortgagee shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this article. A certificate certifying such good faith effort will be issued immediately by the HUD-approved independent counseling agency authorizing the lender/mortgagee to proceed with the foreclosure action to including recording the deed. Such a certification will be the form of a document to be filed along with all other relevant documents with the recorder of deeds. 
(10)  Upon the demand of the lender/mortgagee at any time following completion of the conciliation conference, if the lender/mortgagee is not invoking subsection (8), the HUD-approved independent counseling agency will immediately certify that the provisions of this article have been met. 
(11)  The parties shall complete the process required by this article within a period of sixty (60) days from the initial notice provided in [subsection] (1).

Multi-space meters may accept a variety of payment options, which may include coins, credit cards or stored value cards, such as smart cards. At all times, payment in advance is required at any single meter or multi-space meter. 
(b)  Multi-space meter spaces are defined as any parking space, designated or not, where at least one (1) posted sign states requirement for payment at a multi-space meter. Multi-space meter spaces may not be adjacent to a multi-space meter, but shall be in close proximity to the parking space.

Sec. 15-18. - Removal or impounding of illegally parked vehicles. 
(a)  Generally. Any police officer may remove and impound or cause to be removed or impounded any vehicle illegally parked upon any street or highway, in such violation of any parking regulation or ordinance (other than overtime parking), as to constitute an obstruction to traffic or as to create an unsafe condition, thus jeopardizing public safety; provided nevertheless, that the police department shall, within forty-eight (48) hours, notify the vehicle owner of the said removal or impoundment; of the opportunity for a hearing before a "neutral official," in which the owner may contest the towing (or the deprivation of said vehicle), and the payment of costs or charges accompanying the towing or impoundment; all substantially in accordance with the procedure set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  Post-seizure hearings for towed or impounded vehicles. 
(1)  Notice and request for hearing. As to any vehicle towed or impounded pursuant to this section 15-18 by or at the request of the City of Providence, its agents or employees, a person who has a legal entitlement to possession of the vehicle has a right to a post-seizure administrative hearing to determine whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle if such person files a written demand, on forms so provided for such a hearing, with the police department within ten (10) days after such person has learned such vehicle has been impounded or within ten (10) days after the mailing of the date set in the notice of stored vehicle, whichever occurs first. The notice of stored vehicle shall be sent in the mail to the legal and registered owner or their agent and to the garage where the vehicle is stored within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and holidays, after impounding and storage of the vehicle. 
(2)  Conduct of hearing. A hearing shall be conducted before judge of the municipal court within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of a written demand therefor from the person seeking the hearing unless such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays, Sundays, and city holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of the forty-eight-hour period. The sole issue before the hearing shall be whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. 
Probable cause to impound means such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was sufficient breach of local, state or federal law to grant legal authority for the removal of the vehicle. 
The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right to possession of the vehicle. The police department shall carry the burden of establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. The judge's decision in no way affects any criminal proceeding in connection with the impound in question and that any criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the appropriate court. Failure of the registered or legal owner, or his or her agent to request or attend a scheduled post-seizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such hearing. 
(3)  Decisions and their effect. In the event that the judge determines that there was no probable cause, the official police garage having custody of the vehicle shall release the vehicle to its possessor.

Sec. 16-57. - Unlawful employment practices. 
(a)  Findings and intent. It is the intent of the City of Providence to combat pregnancy discrimination by requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant women and those with conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth. Such a reasonable accommodation may include more frequent or longer breaks, time off to recover from childbirth, acquisition or modification of equipment, seating, temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position, job restructuring, light duty, break time and private nonbathroom space for expressing breast milk, assistance with manual labor, or modified work schedules, among other things. It is not the intent of the City of Providence to require such accommodations if this provision would cause an undue hardship in the conduct of an employer's business. 
(b)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  The term "reasonably accommodate" shall mean providing reasonable accommodations, including, but not limited to: more frequent or longer breaks, time off to recover from childbirth, acquisition or modification of equipment, seating, temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position, job restructuring, light duty, break time and private nonbathroom space for expressing breast milk, assistance with manual labor, or modified work schedules, provided that: 
a.  No employer shall be required by this subsection to create additional employment that the employer would not otherwise have created, unless the employer does so or would do so for other classes of employees who need accommodation, such as those who are injured on-the-job or those with disabilities and; 
b.  The employer shall not be required to discharge any employee, transfer any employee with more seniority, or promote any employee who is not qualified to perform the job, unless the employer does so or would do so to accommodate other classes of employees who need it, such as those who are injured on the job or those with disabilities.

Sec. 16-91. - Declaration of policy and scope. 
(a)  It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city to prohibit unnecessary, excessive, and offensive noise from all sources subject to its police power for the sole purpose of securing and promoting the public health, comfort, safety, and welfare of the citizenry. While recognizing that the use of sound is protected by the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and assembly, unnecessary, excessive, and offensive noises threatens the correlative constitutional rights of the citizens of the community to privacy and freedom from public nuisance and is detrimental to the health, comfort, safety, and welfare of the citizenry. It is with all due consideration of these competing interests that the city council herein regulates the time, place, and manner of the use of sound. 
(b)  This article shall apply to the control of all noise originating within the limits of the city or originating from properties lying outside of the limits of the city, owned or controlled by the city, except where either: 
(1)  A state or federal agency has adopted a different standard or rule than that prescribed in this article which standard or rule preempts the regulation of noise from a particular source as to render this article inapplicable thereto; or 
(2)  The city council has determined, by reason of public acceptance of the activity producing a particular noise, such noise is deemed acceptable to the residents of the city. 
(Ord. 2014, ch. 2014-6, § 1, 3-28-14) 
Sec. 16-92. - Definitions. 
    Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the words and phrases used in this article shall have the following meanings: 
    Ambient noise: The all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment, being a composite of sounds from many sources, near and far. For the purpose of this article, ambient noise level is the average decibel level over five (5) minutes excluding random or intermittent noises and the alleged offensive noise at the location and time of day at which a comparison with an alleged offensive noise is to be made. 
    Decibels (dBA): The decibel is a unit of measure of sound (noise) level relative to a standard reference sound on a logarithmic scale. The decibel level of a given sound is determined as twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure in micronewtons per square meter of the sound being measured to the standard reference sound pressure of twenty (20) micronewtons per square meter (0.0002 microbar). Decibels shall be measured on the A-weighted scale of a sound level meter properly calibrated to comply with the provisions of the American National Standards Institute, "Specifications for Sound Level Meters (ANSI S1.4 1971)." 
    Motor vehicles: Shall include, but not be limited to, automobiles, trucks, SUVs, vans, buses, motorcycles, mini-bikes, scooters, and go-carts. 
    Person: A person means any individual, including the owner of premises or tenant of premises, operator of a vehicle, firm, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or any entity, public or private in nature. 
    Receiving land use: The use or occupancy of the property, or the actual real property, which receives the transmission of sound. 
    Sound amplifying equipment: Any machine or device for the amplification of the human voice, music, or any other sound. "Sound amplifying equipment" shall not include standard motor vehicle radios when used and heard only by the occupants of the vehicle in which the motor vehicle radio is installed. "Sound amplifying equipment" shall not include warning devices on any motor vehicle used only for traffic safety purposes. 
    Unnecessary, excessive, or offensive noise: Any sound or noise conflicting with the criteria, standards, or levels set forth in this article for permissible noises. In the absence of specific maximum noise levels, a noise level which exceeds the ambient noise level by ten (10) dBA or more, when measured at or within the real property boundary of a receiving land use or, in the case of multiple-family residential buildings, when measured anywhere in one (1) dwelling unit with respect to a noise emanating from another dwelling unit or from common space in the same building, or noise audible to a person of reasonably sensitive hearing at a distance of two hundred (200) feet from its source, shall be deemed a prima facie violation of this article.

Sec. 16-121. - Declaration of policy. 
    Excessive false alarms unduly burden the Providence Police Department's limited law enforcement resources. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to establish reasonable expectations of alarm users and to ensure that alarm users are held responsible for their use of alarm systems. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14, § 1, 6-2-17) 
Sec. 16-122. - Definitions. 
    Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the following meanings: 
    Alarm administrator means a person or persons designated by the city to administer, control and review false alarm reduction efforts and administer the provisions of this article. 
    Alarm company means a person subject to the licensing requirements, and/or a company engaged in selling, leasing, installing, servicing or monitoring alarm systems. 
    Alarm signal means a detectable signal; audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which law enforcement is requested to respond. 
    Alarm system means any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other illegal activity requiring immediate attention and to which law enforcement is requested to respond, but does not include motor vehicle or boat alarms, fire alarms, domestic violence alarms, or alarms designed to elicit a medical response. 
    Alarm user means any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning, leasing or operating an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
    Alarm user awareness class means a class conducted for the purpose of educating alarm users about the responsible use, operation, and maintenance of alarm systems and the problems created by false alarms. 
    Automatic dial protection device means an automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which, upon being activated, automatically initiates to the Providence Police Department a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for law enforcement response. 
    Cancellation means the process where response is terminated when the alarm company (designated by the alarm user) notifies the Providence Police Department that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch request. If cancellation occurs prior to police arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of a civil penalty, and no penalty will be assessed. 
    City means the City of Providence or its agent. 
    False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, and signals activated to summon law enforcement personnel unless law enforcement response was cancelled by the user's alarm company before law enforcement personnel arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the Providence Police Department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user. 
    Local alarm means an alarm system that emits a signal at an alarm site that is audible or visible from the exterior of a structure and is not monitored by a remote monitoring facility, whether installed by an alarm company or user. 
    Permit year means a twelve-month period beginning on the day and month on which an alarm permit is issued. 
    Runaway alarm means an alarm system that produces repeated alarm signals that do not appear to be caused by separate human action. The Providence Police Department may in its discretion discontinue police responses to alarm signals from what appears to be a runaway alarm. 
    SIA Control Panel Standard CP-01 means the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) approved security industry association (SIA) CP-01 control panel standard, as may be updated from time to time, that details recommended design features for security system control panels and their associated arming and disarming devices to reduce false alarms. Control panels built and tested to this standard by a nationally recognized testing organization, will be marked to state: "Design evaluated in accordance with SIA CP-01 control panel standard features for false alarm reduction". 
    Verify means an attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. For the purpose of this ordinance, telephone verification shall require, as a minimum that a second call be made to a different number if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14, § 1, 6-2-17) 
Sec. 16-123. - Alarm permits. 
(a)  Permit required . No person shall use an alarm system without first obtaining a permit for such alarm system from the city. A fee may be required for the initial registration and annual renewals. Each alarm permit shall be assigned a unique permit number, and the user shall provide the permit number to facilitate law enforcement dispatch. 
(b)  Application . The permit shall be requested on an application form provided by the city. An alarm user has the duty to obtain an application from the city. 
(c)  Transfer of possession . When the possession of the premises at which an alarm system is maintained is transferred, the person (user) obtaining possession of the property shall file an application for an alarm permit within thirty (30) days of obtaining possession of the property. Alarm permits are not transferable. 
(d)  Reporting updated information . Whenever the information provided on the alarm permit application changes, the alarm user shall provide correct information to the city within thirty (30) days of the change. In addition, each year after the issuance of the permit, permit holders will receive from the city a form requesting updated information. The permit holder shall complete and return this form to the city whether or not any of the requested information has changed; failure to comply will constitute a violation and may result in a civil penalty. 
(e)  Multiple alarm systems . If an alarm user has one (1) or more alarm systems protecting two (2) or more separate structures having different addresses and/or tenants, a separate permit shall be required for each structure and/or tenant. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14, § 1, 6-2-17) 
Sec. 16-124. - Duties of alarm user. 
(a)  Maintain the premises and the alarm system in a method that will reduce or eliminate false alarms; and

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-50, § 1, adopted Sept. 17, 2015, repealed the former art. VI, §§ 17-181-17-203, and enacted a new art. VI as set out herein. The former art. VI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 2013-9, ch. 2013-9, § 1, adopted April 9, 2013; Ord. 2013, ch. 2013-35, §§ 1(17-181.1-17-181.3, 17-182-17-188, 17-188.1, 17-189, 17-189.1, 17-190-17-199), adopted July 31, 2013. 

Sec. 17-181.1 - Purpose. 
    Pursuant to the benefits and rights of self-government prescribed in the Providence Home Rule Charter and guaranteed by the Constitution of the State of Rhode Island, the purpose of this chapter is to preserve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Providence and their property and to ensure the sustainability of the employee retirement system of the city of Providence for current and retired employees by promoting the sustainability and longevity of the employees' retirement system of the City of Providence. 
(Ord. No. 2015-50, § 1, 9-17-15) 
Sec. 17-181.2 - Legislative findings. 
    It is the intention of the city council to ensure the sustainability of the employees' retirement system of the City of Providence and to advance and maintain the long-term stability of said plan. In thoroughly reviewing the condition of said plan and assessing the need for comprehensive reform thereof, including, but not limited to, the April 19, 2012 Report and Recommendations of the City Council Subcommittee on Pension Sustainability, the city council finds and declares the following: 
(1)  The City of Providence currently faces massive and growing structural budget deficits that are placing enormous strains on the city's finances. 
(2)  The city's pension system is severely underfunded, with the unfunded liability at or approaching nine hundred million dollars ($900,000,000.00), and its ever-increasing annual costs are contributing significantly to the city's structural deficits and acute cash shortage. 
(3)  The city has funded less than thirty-one (31) percent of its total pension liability, substantially below the seventy (70) to eighty (80) percent suggested funding rate for most private businesses and governmental entities. Currently, the city's unfunded pension liability is nine hundred million dollars ($900,000,000.00) and the pension plan will not be fully funded for another twenty-eight (28) years. As a consequence, the auditor general of the State of Rhode Island has labeled the city's pension as one (1) of the highest risk plans in the State of Rhode Island. 
(4)  The annual required contribution (the "ARC") for the city pension system and the annual payment for the city's other post-employment benefits ("OPEB"), including retiree healthcare benefits, together total over fifty (50) percent of the city's annual tax levy, leaving less than half of the city's tax levy to fund critical and essential city services. 
(5)  According to the city's internal auditor, the city's projected budget deficit for the current fiscal year has been estimated at between twenty-three million dollars ($23,000,000.00) to thirty million dollars ($30,000,000.00). The projected deficit for the next fiscal year is thirty-one million dollars ($31,000,000.00). Over the succeeding years, the deficit is projected by the internal auditor to grow dramatically to as high as sixty-seven million dollars ($67,000,000.00) in 2017. During that same time, the ARC is projected to grow steadily, such that the payment, which is over fifty-five million dollars ($55,000,000.00) this year, will increase to almost seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000.00) in 2017. The ARC will continue to increase each year until it reaches a maximum of two hundred seven million dollars ($207,000,000.00) in 2039, thereby consuming an ever growing and greater percentage of the city's budget. The projected ARC assumes an eight and one-fourth (81/4) percent rate of return on the pension investments; if the rate of return is lower, the annual projected ARC will be even higher and will further deplete the city's finances. 
(6)  The city's mounting deficits and pension costs will outpace any income that could be raised by an increase in the city's tax levy. According to the city's internal auditor and its outside fiscal adviser, Gary Sasse, if the city increased its tax levy for fiscal year 2014 to the maximum extent permitted by law (four (4) percent), the resulting revenue of thirteen million dollars ($13,000,000.00) would be less than one-third ( 1/3 ) of what would be needed to close the projected structural deficit of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00). Further, the increased ARC for 2014 would consume twenty-five (25) percent of the increased tax levy, leaving only seventy-five (75) percent of the increase to fund the deficit and other needs. 
(7)  The annual percentage limits on additional tax revenue and the ever-increasing ARC prevent the city from making any capital improvements such as school improvements or purchasing new equipment. Further, simply raising taxes each year to fund an ever-increasing ARC would prevent the city from attracting new business and citizens that would, in turn, grow the tax base. Finally, if left unaddressed, the persistent structural deficits, unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities, and the ever-increasing ARC, will ultimately result in the city running out of cash to pay its bills and leaving it with little choice other than to terminate employees, close schools, eliminate fire stations, deny even the most basic services to its citizens, and, ultimately, file for bankruptcy. 
(8)  The city has already implemented a number of cost-savings and revenue generating steps towards closing its structural budget deficits and making its pension system more sustainable. These measures have allowed the city to reduce its budget deficit for the current fiscal year from one hundred ten million dollars ($110,000,000.00) to somewhere between twenty-three million dollars ($23,000,000.00) and thirty million dollars ($30,000,000.00). The city's pension obligations are, as aforesaid, a major contributor to the city's fiscal crisis. A major cost driver of the city's pension system is, in turn, the annual cost-of-living adjustments ("COLAs") enjoyed by hundreds of city retirees. More specifically, many of the retiree's pensions compound at rates ranging from as high as three (3) percent to six (6) percent. Approximately one-fourth (1/4) of retirees are currently receiving annual COLAs of five (5) percent to six (6) percent. A pension with a six (6) percent compounding COLA doubles approximately every twelve (12) to thirteen (13) years and a pension with a five (5) percent compounding COLA doubles approximately every ten (10) years. 
(9)  Suspension of the COLAs until the pension system attains a more secure level of funding of seventy (70) percent would result in significant and desperately needed cost savings for the pension system and the city. This measure would immediately increase the funding of the system from its current rate of thirty-one (31) percent to almost forty (40) percent. Further, the measure would result in a two hundred forty million dollars ($240,000,000.00) reduction of the unfunded pension liability from nine hundred million dollars ($900,000,000.00) to six hundred fifty-nine million dollars ($659,000,000.00). The measure would also reduce the ARC and result in one hundred (100) percent funding of the pension system several years ahead of the current amortization schedule.

(Ord. No. 2015-50, § 1, 9-17-15) 
Sec. 17-185. - Method of financing. 
    The funds hereby created are the annuity savings fund, the annuity reserve fund, the pension accumulation fund and the pension reserve fund. 
(1)  Annuity savings fund . The annuity savings fund shall be a fund in which shall be accumulated contributions from the compensation of members to provide for their annuities and their withdrawal allowances. Upon the basis of such tables as the retirement board shall adopt and regular interest, the actuary of the retirement system shall determine for each class A member the proportion of the compensation which, when deducted from each payment of prospective earnable annual compensation prior to eligibility for service retirement and accumulated at regular interest until attainment of the minimum age of service retirement within the member's group, shall be computed to provide at that time an annuity equal to the pension provided on account of service as a member. Such proportion of compensation shall be computed to remain constant. In the event that the provisions of this article for the determination of the amount of the pension of a class A employee on account of the employee's service as a member shall at any time, be amended, the retirement board shall adopt, as of the effective date of such amendment, rates of contribution for class A employees computed on the basis of such amendment and such contribution rates shall apply to all members who become class A employees after said effective date at the age attained upon entrance into such class. No increase in percentage contribution rates shall be required of members who are so classified on said effective date, but any such members may elect prior to said date to contribute at the rate as so amended applicable to the member's age attained on said date and thereafter deductions shall be made from the member's compensation at such amended rate. The retirement board shall adopt as of July 1, 1989, for employees in class B who are members of the police department, a percentage contribution rate of eight (8) per centum on a pre-tax basis and as of July 1, 1990 for employees in class B who are members of the fire department, a percentage contribution rate of eight (8) percent and an additional one and one-half (11/2) percent to be set aside in an OPEB trust fund to be administered by the city, both contributions shall be on a pre-tax basis and thereafter deductions shall be made from the compensation of all members so classified at this rate, anything to the contrary in this article notwithstanding. The retirement board shall adopt as of July 1, 1974, for employees in class A, a percentage contribution rate of eight (8) percent, and thereafter deductions shall be made from the compensation of all members so classified at this rate, anything to the contrary in this article notwithstanding. The pension contribution rate for all class B members of the fire department hired on or after July 1, 2011 shall be set at nine (9) percent of their base pay and longevity; and an additional one and one-half (11/2) percent of their base pay and longevity to be set aside in an OPEB trust fund to be administered by the city. Both contributions shall be on a pre-tax basis. 
The city controller shall certify the proportion of earnable compensation of each member so computed, and he or she shall deduct such proportion from the compensation of each member on each and every payroll of each department for each and every payroll period but the city controller shall not make any deductions for annuity purposes from the annual compensation of a member who elects not to contribute, if the member has completed twenty-five (25) years of creditable service and the member no longer receives pension service credits. If the member has completed twenty-five (25) years of creditable service, the controller shall continue to make deductions for annuity purposes from the annual compensation of the member if the member continues to accrue creditable service. In determining the amount earnable by members in a payroll period, the retirement board may consider the rate of annual compensation payable to such members on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period and it may omit deductions from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if an employee was not a member on the first day of the payroll period; and to facilitate the making of deductions it may modify the deduction required by any member by such an amount as shall not exceed one-tenth ( 1/10 ) of one (1) percent of the annual compensation upon the basis of which said deduction is to be made. The deductions provided for herein shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided for by law for any member shall be reduced thereby. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for herein and shall receipt for the member's full salary or compensation; and payment of salary or compensation less said deduction shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment except as to the benefits provided under this article. Said amounts shall be deducted and when deducted shall be paid into said annuity savings fund, and shall be credited, together with regular interest, to an individual account of the member from whose compensation said deduction was made. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, pursuant to the provisions of section 414(h)(2) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, the City of Providence shall assume and pay the contributions which would be payable by the employees as members. Such contributions, although designated as employee contributions, shall be paid by the City of Providence in lieu of contributions by the employee. No employee shall have the option of choosing to receive such contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the City of Providence. The contributions so assumed shall be treated and identified, without limitation, as member contributions for all purposes of the retirement system. 
Employee contributions assumed pursuant to this subsection shall be paid from the same source of funds used for the payment of compensation to an employee. A deduction shall be made from the employees' compensation equal to the amounts of the employees' contributions assumed by the City of Providence. These deductions, however, shall not reduce the employees' compensation for purposes of computing benefits under the retirement system pursuant to this ordinance or for purposes of determining any other member benefits. 
Assumed contributions shall be transferred to the retirement system and be credited to a separate subaccount within the employees' account in order that the amounts contributed prior to the effective date of the assumption of employee contributions shall be distinguished from the amounts contributed on or after the date on which the City of Providence assumes the employees' contributions. 
In addition to the contributions deducted from compensation hereinbefore provided, any member may redeposit in the annuity savings fund by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution an amount equal to the total amount which the member withdrew previously therefrom as provided in this article, or any member may deposit therein by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution an amount to be used to provide an additional annuity. Such additional amounts so deposited shall become a part of the member's accumulated contributions except in the case of retirement, when they shall be treated as excess contributions returnable to the member in the same manner and form as the member's normal accumulated contributions. The accumulated contributions of a member, withdrawn by the member or paid to the member's estate or to the member's designated beneficiary in the event of the member's death as provided in this article, shall be paid from the annuity savings fund. Upon retirement of a member, the member's accumulated contributions shall be transferred from the annuity savings fund to the annuity reserve fund. Subject to such rules and regulations as the retirement board may provide, any members who has have at least three (3) years of total service may borrow from their account in the annuity savings fund for the following purposes: 
a.  Medical expenses, including dental and hospital expenses. 
b.  Funeral expenses. 
c.  Down payment on the purchase of real estate to be used in whole or in part as the member's home, or to be used for home improvements of member's home (primary residence). 
d.  Educational expenses limited to member, member's spouse, member's domestic partner, member's children and/or dependent(s). 
e.  The aggregate amount of loans outstanding to any member shall never exceed the lesser of the following amounts: 
i.  Fifty (50) percent of the amount of the member's accumulated contributions. 
ii.  An amount, together with interest thereon, which must be repaid within ten (10) years by additional deductions from the member's compensation. 
iii.  No loan shall be issued for less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). 
f.  Prior to approval the member shall sign a sworn affidavit which specifically states the purpose for the loan. 
The rate of interest payable on the unpaid balance of such loans shall be fixed at the date of commencement of the loan at the rate established by the pension system's investment rate of return on the investment portfolio, plus one (1) percent. The principal amount, together with interest thereon, shall be repaid to the retirement system in equal installments in such amounts as the board shall approve, and shall be deducted from the compensation of the member at the same time and in the same manner as the member's contributions to the retirement system are deducted. Such installments shall be at least equal to five (5) percent of the member's compensation. 
All payments of principal and regular interest made by a borrowing member shall be credited to the member's account in the annuity savings fund. The excess of the interest paid by the member over the regular interest creditable to the account of the member shall be credited to the pension accumulation fund. The amount of any benefit which becomes payable under the provisions of this article shall be determined on the basis of the member's accumulated contributions less the outstanding balance of such loan, and the pension shall be determined as if such loan had not been made. Should a beneficiary be restored to active service, the member's annuity reserve shall be transferred from the accumulation fund to the member's credit in the annuity savings fund. 
(2)  Annuity reserve fund . The annuity reserve fund shall be the fund from which shall be paid all annuities and all benefits in lieu of annuities, payable as provided in this article. Should a beneficiary retired on account of disability be restored to active service, his or her annuity shall cease and his or her annuity reserve shall be transferred to his or her credit in the annuity savings fund. 
(3)  Pension accumulation fund . The pension accumulation fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated all reserves for the payment of all pensions and other benefits payable from contributions made by the City of Providence and from which such pensions and other benefits shall be paid to or on account of beneficiaries credited with prior service. Contributions to and payments from the pension accumulation fund shall be made as follows: 
a.  On account of each member there shall be paid annually into the pension accumulation fund by the City of Providence for the preceding fiscal period, a certain percentage of the earnable compensation of each member to be known as the "normal contribution," and an additional percentage of the earnable compensation to be known as the "deficiency contribution." The rates per centum of such contributions shall be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement system as shown by actuarial valuations. Until the first valuation, the normal contribution shall be two and sixty-seven one-hundredths (2 67/100 ) percent and the deficiency contribution shall be two and forty-five one-hundredths (2 45/100 ) percent of the salaries of all members. 
b.  On the basis of regular interest and of such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the retirement board, the actuary engaged by the city council to make each valuation required by this article during the period over which the deficiency contribution is payable, immediately after making such valuation, shall determine the uniform and constant percentage of the earnable compensation of the average new entrant, which, if contributed on the basis of compensation throughout the entire period of active service would be sufficient to provide at the time of retirement the total amount of the member's pension reserve. The rate per centum so determined shall be known as the "normal contribution" rate. After the deficiency contribution has ceased to be payable, the normal contribution shall be the rate per centum of the earnable salary of all members obtained by deducting from the total liabilities of the pension accumulation fund the amount of the funds in hand to the credit of that fund and dividing the remainder by one (1) percent of the present value of the prospective future salaries of all members as computed on the basis of the mortality and service tables adopted by the retirement board and regular interest. The normal rate of contribution shall be determined by the actuary after each mortality and service investigation and shall continue in force until a new investigation and certification. 
c.  Immediately succeeding the first valuation, the actuary engaged by the city council shall compute the rate per centum of the total compensation of all members during the preceding fiscal year which is equivalent to four (4) percent of the amount of the total pension liability on account of all members and beneficiaries not dischargeable by the aforesaid normal contribution made on account of such members during the remainder of their active service. The rate per centum originally so determined shall be known as the "deficiency contribution rate." On the basis of the first actuarial valuation following the first day of April, 1965, the deficiency contribution rate shall be revised to provide for the liquidation of the deficiency then existing. 
d.  The total amount payable in each year to the pension accumulation fund shall not be less than the sum of the rates per centum known as the normal contribution rate and the deficiency contribution rate of the total compensation earnable by all members during the preceding fiscal period; provided, however, the sum of such rates per centum need not exceed the rate per centum of the earnable salary of all members obtained by deducting from seventy (70) percent of the total liabilities of all funds except the annuity savings fund the amount of the funds in hand to the credit of such funds and dividing the remainder by one (1) percent of the present value of the prospective future salaries of all members as computed on the basis of the mortality and service tables adopted by the retirement board and regular interest. The aggregate payment by the city into the pension accumulation fund shall be sufficient, when combined with the amount in the fund, to provide the pension payable out of the fund during the year then current. 
e.  The deficiency contribution shall be discontinued as soon as the accumulated reserve in the pension accumulation fund shall equal the present value, as actuarially computed and approved by the city council, of the total liability of such fund less the present value, computed on the basis of the normal contribution rate then in force, of the normal contributions to be received on account of persons who are at that time members. 
f.  All pensions with the exception of those payable on account of members who received no prior service allowance shall be paid from the pension accumulation fund. 
g.  Upon the retirement of a member not entitled to prior service allowance, an amount equal to the member's pension reserve shall be transferred from the pension accumulation fund to the pension reserve fund. 
(4)  Pension reserve fund . The pension reserve fund shall be the fund from which shall be paid the pensions to members not entitled to a prior service allowance. Should any disability pension payable from said fund be canceled, the pension reserve thereon shall thereupon be transferred from the pension reserve fund to the pension accumulation fund. Should the pension of a disability beneficiary be reduced as a result of an increase in the beneficiary's earning capacity, the amount of the annual reduction in the beneficiary's pension shall be paid annually into the pension accumulation fund during the period of such reduction.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of the adoption of service and mortality tables pursuant to subsection (g) of section 17-183 of this article, the retirement board may classify the members in class A or in class B as may be recommended by the actuary on the basis of the service and mortality experience and approved by the retirement board. 
    The board shall certify to the member the class in which he is placed and the date of his/her admission to membership therein. When the duties of a member so require, the retirement board may reclassify him in another class and shall thereupon certify to him the class to which he/she has been transferred, provided that no member having fifteen (15) or more years of service creditable to him as a member of one (1) class may be so reclassified. 
    Should the service of any member in any period of ten (10) consecutive years after last becoming a member amount to less than five (5) years, or should he withdraw his/her accumulated contributions or should he become a beneficiary or die, he shall thereupon cease to be a member. 
(Ord. No. 2015-50, § 1, 9-17-15) 
Sec. 17-188. - Service creditable-Generally. 
(a)  The retirement board shall fix and determine by appropriate rules and regulations how much service in any year is equivalent to a year of service, but in computing such service or in computing the compensation, it shall credit no period of more than a month's duration in which a member was absent without pay nor shall more than one (1) year of service be credited on account of all service in one (1) calendar year. 
(b)  At retirement, the total service credited a member shall consist of the service rendered by the member as an employee since last becoming a member and any additional service hereinafter provided. In no event shall the total service credited to a class B member exceed thirty-two (32) years and six (6) months; provided, however, that service rendered by such member after minimum retirement age shall not be considered as credited service unless the member has continued to make his/her required contributions after the attainment of such age.

(2)  A pension, in addition to the annuity, of sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent of his/her final compensation, or a pension equal to the amount of retirement allowance provided in subsection (b) of this section, whichever is greater. 
(3)  Any member who retires pursuant to section 17-189(f) accidental disability retirement, in light of said member's receipt of an unreduced pension in the amount of sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent of retirement pay, said member shall not be entitled to his/her accumulated pension contributions, with interest, in any form, including but not limited to a lump sum or an actuarially calculated annuity.

a.  To his/her widow/widower, to continue during his/her widowerhood/widowhood; or 
b.  If there be no widow/widower, or if the widow/widower dies or remarries before any child dependent of such deceased member shall have attained the age of nineteen (19) years, then to his/her child or children under said age, divided in such manner as the retirement board in its discretion, shall determine, to continue as a joint and survivor pension of one-half (1/2) of his/her final compensation until every such child dies or attains said age; or 
c.  If there be no widow/widower or child under the age of nineteen (19) years surviving such deceased member, then to his/her dependent father or mother, as the deceased member shall have nominated by written designation, duly acknowledged and filed with the retirement board; or if there be no such nomination, then to his/her dependent father or to his/her dependent mother, as the retirement board in its discretion shall direct, to continue for life. 
(h)  Re-examination of members retired on account of disability . Notwithstanding any other ordinance, prior collective bargaining agreement, or prior interest arbitration award to the contrary: 
(1)  Re-examination of members retired on account of disability. Once each year the director of personnel may require all pensioners to undergo a medical examination, such examination to be made at the place of residence of the pensioner or other place mutually agreed upon, by a physician or physicians engaged by the director of personnel. In accordance with this section, each pensioner shall annually provide certification from a physician of their disability. Should any such pensioner refuse to submit to such examination his or her pension shall be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal, and should his or her refusal continue for a year, all his or her rights in and to such pension shall be revoked by the retirement board. If the said examination indicates that the disability of the pensioner has been removed and said pensioner has attained the age of service retirement said pension will be converted to the normal retirement benefit as if he or she had not been disabled. If the examination indicates that the disability of the pensioner has been removed and said pensioner is under the age of service retirement, his or her name shall be placed on such appropriate lists of candidates as are prepared for appointment to a position in his department for which he is stated to be qualified in a salary grade comparable to that from which he or she was last retired. Upon reinstatement to active service at a salary grade comparable to that from which he or she was last retired, he or she shall be reinstated as a member and participate in the benefits of the retirement system with credit for service rendered prior to disability retirement, and for the period during which he received the disability retirement allowance, provided that he or she did not refuse to accept such reinstatement when it was first offered to him or her; in the event of such refusal, the pension shall be discontinued and any rights to further benefits under the retirement system shall be based solely on his or her service rendered prior to his or her disability retirement. 
(i)  Accidental death benefit . Upon the accidental death of a member before retirement, provided that evidence shall be submitted to the retirement board providing that the death of such member was the natural and proximate result of an accident while in the performance of duty at some definite time and place and that such death was not the result of willful negligence on his part, his accumulated contributions shall be paid to his estate, or to such person having an insurable interest in his life as he shall have nominated by written designation, duly executed and filed with the retirement board; and upon application by or on behalf of the dependents of such deceased member the retirement board shall grant a pension of one-half (1/2) the final compensation of such member: 
(1)  To his/her widow/widower, to continue during his/her widower hood/widowhood; or 
(2)  If there be no widow/widower, or if the widow/widower dies or remarries before any child of such deceased member shall have attained the age of nineteen (19) years, then to his child or children under said age, divided in such manner as the retirement board in its discretion, shall determine, to continue as a joint and survivor pension of one-half (1/2) of his final compensation until every such child dies or attains said age; or 
(3)  If there be no widow/widower or child under the age of nineteen (19) years surviving such deceased member, then to his dependent father or mother, as the deceased member shall have nominated by written designation, duly acknowledged and filed with the retirement board; or if there be no such nomination, then to his dependent father or to his dependent mother, as the retirement board in its discretion shall direct, to continue for life. 
(j)  Deferred retirement benefit . Any employee who has ten (10) or more years of total service may retire upon his written application to the retirement board setting forth at what time, not less than thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90) days subsequent to the execution and filing thereof, he desires to be retired, provided that the member, at the time so specified for his retirement, shall have fulfilled the above service requirement and notwithstanding that, during such period of notification, he may have separated from service. 
(k)  Allowance upon deferred retirement . Upon deferred retirement a member shall receive a deferred retirement allowance commencing at minimum retirement age calculated in the same manner as provided in subsection (2) of this section. 
(l)  Restoration to service . Should a beneficiary retired on a service retirement allowance or a deferred retirement benefit be restored to service the individual shall again become a member and any election of an optional benefit shall be null and void. If payment of his retirement allowance has commenced, such allowance shall cease. Upon subsequent retirement, if the individual has completed one (1) year of service following his restoration, the individual shall receive a retirement allowance based on the individual's total service before and after the individual's restoration to service; otherwise, the individual's retirement allowance shall be equal to the sum of the retirement allowance computed as of the date of the individual's previous retirement and the retirement allowance computed on the basis of the individual's service subsequent to restoration. 
(m)  Withdrawal and ordinary death benefit . Benefits upon withdrawal and ordinary death shall be payable as follows: 
(1)  A member who withdraws from service or ceases to be a member for any reason other than death or retirement shall be paid on demand the accumulated contributions standing to the credit of his individual account in the annuity savings fund which were credited prior to the effective date of City of Providence's assumption of the employee's contributions pursuant to section 17-185(1). A member retired on a deferred retirement benefit may elect, prior to the date upon which the first payment on account of his retirement allowance becomes normally due, to receive in lieu of his retirement allowance the amount of the accumulated contributions standing to the credit of his individual account in the annuity savings fund which were credited prior to the effective date of City of Providence's assumption of the employee's contributions pursuant to section 17-185(1). Payment of such amount shall constitute a full and complete discharge of any further claim by him or any beneficiary claiming through him for benefits under this article. In either instance, a member may withdraw the accumulated contributions standing to the credit of his individual account in the annuity fund which were credited on or following the effective date of City of Providence's assumption of the employee's contributions pursuant to section 17-185(1), but as to such funds, the employee will be liable for any taxable consequences including penalties for such a withdrawal. 
(2)  Should a member die before retirement or should a retired member die within thirty (30) days after the date upon which the first payment on account of his retirement allowance becomes normally due, his accumulated contributions less the amount of any retirement allowance payments he may have received, shall be paid to his estate, or to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation, duly executed and filed with the retirement board. 
(3)  Should a member who has attained minimum retirement age and who dies before retirement without his having made an election under the provisions of section 17-190 of this article be survived by a spouse, such spouse shall be entitled, in lieu of return of the member's accumulated contributions as provided under paragraph (2) of this subsection, to a benefit determined in the same manner as it would have been determined had the member retired from service on the date of his death and made an effective election of a reduced retirement allowance in accordance with option 2 under section 17-190 of this article and nominated his spouse as his designated beneficiary. 
(4)  Upon the death of a retired member who has not made an optional selection as provided in section 17-190 of this article or upon the death of the survivor of a retired member and the beneficiary under an optional selection as provided in section 17-190 of this article, if such optional selection has been made and become effective, a payment shall be made to the estate of the retired member, or to the estate of the survivor as the case may be, or to such person as the retired member shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the retirement board in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the retired member's normal accumulated contributions at retirement over the sum of the payment made on account of his pension and normal annuity, plus the excess, if any, of the retired member's excess accumulated contributions at retirement over the payments made on account of his excess annuity. 
(5)  Upon the death of any class B member who at the time of his death was eligible to retire from service, if no accidental death benefit is payable and if an effective election of an optional benefit has not been made under section 17-190, a retirement allowance equal to sixty-seven and one-half (671/2) percent of the retirement allowance, exclusive of any excess annuity, that would have been paid to such member had he retired shall be paid to his surviving spouse for her lifetime until she remarries, or if there be no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse remarries, then to his dependent children until they attain eighteen (18) years of age. The benefit provided under this this subsection (m)(3) shall be in lieu of any benefit under this subsection (m)(3) and shall be payable only if it exceeds the benefit otherwise provided under this subsection (m)(3). 
(6)  Upon the death of any class B member who has retired from service, if no pension is payable pursuant to this subsection 17-189(g)(3) of this section, a pension equal to sixty-seven and one-half (671/2) percent of the retirement allowance, exclusive of any excess annuity, paid to such retired member shall be paid to his surviving spouse, for her lifetime until she remarries, or if there be no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse remarries, then to his dependent children until they attain the age of eighteen (18). 
(n)  Eligibility for an allowance . The eligibility for a retirement allowance and the amount of such allowance shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance to provide for the retirement of employees of the city as in effect on the last day of a member's employment. 
(o)  Additional benefits for retired class A employees and their beneficiaries . Effective January 1, 1993, the benefits for any retired class A employee who retired prior to January 1, 1993 or his beneficiary shall be adjusted to provide a minimum monthly retirement allowance of six hundred eighteen dollars ($618.00); provided, however, if the member elected to receive a reduced retirement allowance in accordance with the available options, said six hundred eighteen dollar ($618.00) minimum monthly allowance shall be reduced to reflect the option elected. In the event the retired class A employee has completed less than twenty-five (25) years of service, he or his beneficiary shall be entitled to receive one-twenty-fifth ( 1/25 ) of the minimum monthly retirement allowance for each year of his service.

(b)  Definitions. For purposes of this section: 
(1)  Board shall mean the retirement board of the employees' retirement system of the City of Providence; 
(2)  Crime related to his or her public employment shall constitute "dishonorable service," and shall include any of the following conduct, whether or not the conduct results in a criminal conviction: 
a.  Committing or aiding or abetting the commission of embezzlement of public funds; 
b.  Committing or aiding or abetting the commission of any felonious theft by a public employee from his or her employer; 
c.  Committing or aiding or abetting the commission of bribery in connection with, or involving, a public employee; 
d.  Committing or aiding or abetting the commission of any felony by a public employee who willfully, and with the intent to defraud, realizes or obtains, or attempts to realize or obtain, a profit, gain, or advantage for himself or herself or for some other person through the use or attempted use of power, rights, privileges, duties, or position of his or her public office or employment; and 
e.  Any other misconduct or crime which the board, by a majority vote, determines is "dishonorable service," after weighing and balancing the following factors: 
i.  The employee's length of service; 
ii.  The basis for retirement i.e., age service, disability, etc.; 
iii.  The extent to which the employee's pension has vested; 
iv.  The duties of the particular employment; 
v.  The employee's public employment history and record; 
vi.  The employee's other public employment and service; 
vii.  The nature of the misconduct or crime, whether it involved an isolated act or multiple acts, and its gravity or substantiality; 
viii.  The relationship between the misconduct or crime and the employee's public duties; 
ix.  The quality of moral turpitude or the degree of guilt and culpability, including the employee's motives and reasons, personal gain, and the like; 
x.  The availability and adequacy of penal sanctions; and

(3)  Employee shall mean any current or former city elected official, or any appointed official or employee of the city, or of a city board, commission or agency, who is otherwise entitled to receive a pension. 
(4)  Pension shall include an employee's retirement allowance or annuity or other benefit or payment as provided in chapter 17. 
(c)  Mandatory board action. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a pension shall be revoked or reduced by the board under this section if an employee is convicted of, or pleads guilty or nolo contendere, to any crime related to his or her public employment. Any such conviction or plea shall be deemed to be "dishonorable service" and a breach of the employee's contract with his or her employer; however, for purposes of this section, "pleads guilty or nolo contendere " shall not include any plea of guilty or nolo contendere which does not result in a conviction by virtue of R.I.G.L. 1956, § 12-10-12 or § 12-18-3, as amended. 
(d)  Permissive board action. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a pension may be revoked or reduced by the board under this section if a majority of the board determines by a preponderance of the evidence that an employee has engaged in "dishonorable service" after weighing and balancing the factors set forth in section (b)(2) e. 
(e)  Due process. If a majority of the members of the board vote to consider any action to revoke or reduce any pension, the board, before taking any such action, shall: 
(1)  Conduct a meeting with the involved employees and inform the employee of the alleged conduct forming the basis of the contemplated board action; and thereafter, 
(2)  Provide the employee, and his or her spouse or domestic partner, dependents and/or designated beneficiaries, with ample notice of the relevant alleged conduct and an opportunity to be heard.

(2)  The board shall decide whether the revocation or reduction shall take effect (and be calculated) from the date: (A) of the dishonorable service; or (B) the date notice was provided under section (e)(2); or (C) the date of the board's decision under section (g); and 
(3)  If the board determines to revoke or reduce a pension, the employee's contribution to the pension system shall be refunded, without interest; however, if, as of the date of the board decision, the employee: (A) has not made full restitution for any loss proximately caused by his or her dishonorable service (including, but not limited, to, the fees and costs incurred by the board), and/or (B) has already received pension payments, the amount of the unreimbursed loss and/or the pension payments received shall be deducted from any such refund. 
(g)  Appeal and standard of review. 
(1)  If the board determines by a majority vote that revocation or reduction of a pension is warranted, it shall make specific factual findings in support thereof and shall render a written decision, which shall be appealable to the Superior Court as long as such an appeal is filed within twenty (20) calendar days from the date the board decision was rendered. Such appeals shall be decided by the superior court sitting without a jury, and there shall be no automatic stay pending appeal. 
(2)  When reviewing a board decision, the superior court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the board as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the board, or alternatively, may remand the case for further proceedings or reverse or modify the decision, if the substantial rights of the employee have been prejudiced because of findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of the board which are: 
a.  In violation of constitutional, statutory or ordinance provisions; 
b.  In excess of the authority granted to the board by ordinance; 
c.  Made upon unlawful procedure; 
d.  Affected by other error of law; 
e.  Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence of the whole record; or 
f.  Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. 
(h)  Separability. The unconstitutionality or invalidity of any section or part of this ordinance shall not invalidate or impair the validity, force or effect of any other section or part thereof, which shall remain in full force and effect.

    Until the first payment on account of a retirement allowance becomes normally due, any member may elect to convert the retirement allowance, otherwise payable on his account after retirement, into a retirement allowance of equivalent actuarial value of one (1) of the optional forms named below. However, an election of an optional benefit shall not be effective until sixty (60) days after the date of the filing of the election thereof with the retirement board, or until thirty (30) days after the date upon which the first payment on account of his retirement allowance becomes normally due, whichever is the later, and should the member die before such election becomes effective, the benefits payable on his account shall be the same as though his election had not been filed and he had not been retired. Such optional retirement allowances shall be payable throughout life with the provisions that: 
(1)  Option 1 . If he dies before he has received in payments the present value of his retirement allowance as it was at the time of his retirement, the balance shall be paid to his legal representatives, or such person having an insurable interest in his life, as he, his spouse, or his guardian so electing shall nominate by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the retirement board. 
(2)  Option 2 .

(4)  Option 4 . Some other benefit or benefits shall be paid to either the beneficiary or to such person or persons as he, his spouse, or his guardian, so electing, shall nominate, provided such other benefit or benefits together with such lesser retirement allowance, shall be certified by the actuary of the retirement system to be of equivalent actuarial value to his benefit and shall be approved by the retirement board. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, any member who has attained minimum retirement age may elect, in accordance with option 2, 3, or 4 above, a reduced retirement allowance with provision for benefits to his spouse or to a person having an insurable interest in his life other than his spouse. Such benefits shall be determined as of the date of his death or retirement, if prior thereto, in accordance with the provisions of the option elected and shall be in lieu of the return of the member's accumulated contributions as provided under subsection (m)(2) of section 17-189 of this article. In the event of death prior to retirement, the benefit payable to the designated beneficiary shall be determined in the same manner as it would have been determined had the member retired from service on the date of his death. However, such election of an optional benefit shall not be effective until sixty (60) days after the date of the filing of the election thereof with the retirement board. After such election shall have become effective it shall be irrevocable except in the event that the designated beneficiary predeceases the member prior to his retirement.

(2)  In the event a person who was an elective officer shall be deceased and who:

This includes assisting MBEs and WBEs throughout the life of contracts in which they participate. 
(b)  Summary of factual findings. Upon full consideration of all relevant facts, the city council finds that: 
    Based upon the records supplied by the purchasing director/controller that the City of Providence has purchased, in the two (2) previous fiscal years (87-88, 88-89) and the current fiscal year (89-90) less than one (1) percent of its goods and services from firms owned or controlled by minorities or women; that based upon the testimony and evidence provided during the public hearings, individuals, minorities and women as well as businesses owned by minorities and women have been discriminated against by other businesses not owned or controlled by minorities or women in the City of Providence and the State of Rhode Island; that there was no evidence that there is not discrimination against women and minorities in acquiring business within the City of Providence from other sources despite the public hearings and the opportunity to introduce any evidence; it is in the best interest of the city to promote the equitable utilization of MBEs and WBEs in city contracting; that the requirements of this chapter are necessary to overcome the present effects of discrimination and are designed to achieve the goal of equitable utilization of MBEs and WBEs while at the same time maintaining a high quality of goods and services provided to the city through competitive bidding as required by City Charter.

In addition, prime contractors shall utilize MBEs and WBEs so as to enable the city, its purchasing department, and all its contracting departments to meet or exceed the goals set forth in this section. The utilization of MBEs and WBEs as subcontractors and/or suppliers to the prime contractor, and/or the use of minority and women laborers, will be considered in determining the lowest possible bidder. 
(d)  Applicability. This section shall apply to any and all city purchasing, including, but not limited to, the procurement of goods and services and construction projects or contracts funded in whole or in part by city funds, or funds which, in accordance with federal grant or otherwise, the city expends or administers or in which the city is a signatory to the construction contract.

ARTICLE III1/2. - FIRST-SOURCE AGREEMENTS[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. 2012, ch. 2012-27, § 1, adopted June 7, 2012, amended Art. III1/2 in its entirety, with the exclusion of § 21-91, to read as set out herein. Former Art. III1/2, §§ 21-92-21-96, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 1985, ch. 85-62, §§ 1-6, adopted June 14, 1985. 

Sec. 21-91. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to any and all businesses in the City of Providence who shall receive aid in cash or in-kind from the City of Providence above and beyond the normal services provided to all businesses and residents in the city. This shall include tax concessions, and/or abatements, other than adjustments made by the tax assessor or the board of tax assessment review; grants-in-aid, grants from the office of community development, office of economic development, or other federal aid programs administered by the City of Providence, U.D.A.G.'s, H.O.D.A.G.'s or any program requiring authorization by resolution of the city council unless specifically exempted by ordinance. In addition, this shall include any project funded in whole or in part by city funds, or funds which, in accordance with a federal grant or otherwise the city expends or administers, or which the city is a signatory to the construction contract. This requirement shall not apply, however, to businesses of four (4) employees or less. 
(Ord. 1985, ch. 85-62, § 1, 6-14-85) 
Sec. 21-91.1. - Legislative findings. 
    It is the intention of the city council to preserve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Providence and their property by ensuring that all significant public investments of taxpayer dollars require that employers utilize the Providence First Source List for jobs created as a result of the public investment. In thoroughly reviewing the state and condition of the Providence First Source List, including, but not limited to, the September 6, 2011 report and recommendations of the city council commission to study and evaluate the city's first source ordinance, the city council finds and declares the following: 
(1)  Unemployment and underemployment remain serious and important problems facing the residents of Providence with the February 2012 unemployment rate reaching 13.5 percent signifying that ten thousand eight hundred sixty-seven (10,867) Providence residents are out of work. 
(2)  The City of Providence faces significant economic and social hardship with a structural budget deficit of seventy million dollars ($70,000,000.00) in fiscal year 2011 and one hundred ten million dollars ($110,000,000.00) in fiscal year 2012 and a local economy devastated by the dual impacts of an economic and foreclosure crisis. 
(3)  The City of Providence's extremely high unemployment rate has significantly impacted the ability of our citizens to pay rent and/or mortgages for the dwellings in which they live. The result has been hundreds of foreclosures in recent years causing a decline in property values for all city residents and property owners. 
(4)  As a result of the high unemployment and foreclosure rates, declining property values, and a tax base severely limited by tax-exempt property holdings, the city cannot raise any substantial monies to fund much needed public works projects and provide grants and loans for essential social programs. 
(5)  The cost of public works projects, grants and loans to non-profits, as well as tax stabilization agreements, incentives, discounts, and credits that are provided to the private sector to induce economic development are borne by the residents and business owners who pay the full property tax rate. 
(6)  The high rates of unemployment and foreclosure have caused increases in property crimes - crimes steeped in the conditions of a stagnant economy. These crimes have a direct and deleterious effect upon all the neighborhoods and areas of the city, resulting in vandalism, crime, and the physical deterioration of neighborhoods and areas. 
(7)  In order to adequately fund these projects, the city needs to maintain adequate property values; and in order to maintain property values, the city needs to provide access to gainful employment for its citizens. 
(8)  Unless the city's citizens are provided with an opportunity to be hired on projects that their tax dollars fund, unemployment will remain high, property values will further decline, foreclosures will increase, crime will also increase, and the city will not be able to pay for or provide essential public works projects, social programs, and incentives to the private sector that will induce economic activity. 
(Ord. 2012, ch. 2012-27, § 1, 6-7-12) 
Sec. 21-91.2. - Covered employers. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to any and all employers, entities, and/or businesses that receive any of the following forms of aid from the City of Providence above and beyond the normal services provided to all businesses and residents in the city in an amount that exceeds more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) over the course of one (1) calendar year. 
(1)  Tax concessions, and/or abatements, other than adjustments made by the tax assessor or the board of tax assessment review, tax stabilization agreements, tax incremental financing agreements. 
(2)  Grants, grants-in-aid, and/or loans from the office of community development, office of planning and development, or other federal aid programs administered by the City of Providence, or any program requiring authorization by resolution of the city council unless specifically exempted by ordinance. 
(3)  Projects funded in whole or in part by city funds, or funds which, in accordance with a federal grant or otherwise the city expends or administers, or which the city is a signatory to the construction contract. 
    This section shall not apply, however, to entities of four (4) employees or less. Should a previously exempted employer, entity and/or businesses grow to five (5) employees or more, the provisions of this section shall apply. 
(Ord. 2012, ch. 2012-27, § 1, 6-7-12) 
Sec. 21-92. - Covered jobs. 
    Jobs covered by this section shall include all positions created as a result of internal promotions, terminations, and expansion of the employer's workforce, except those filled by internal promotion from within the employer's local workforce for the term that the employer, entity and/or business receives aid from the city as defined in section 21-91. Jobs covered by this section shall also include all contractors, subcontractors, tenants and subleasees that do business on, work at, or are located at the site or locus where aid from the city is received for any and all new employees needed to work at the site or locus of the subject premises for the term that the site receives aid from the city as defined in section 21-91. 
(Ord. 2012, ch. 2012-27, § 1, 6-7-12) 
Sec. 21-93. - Nature of first source applicability. 
(a)  Any employer, entity and/or business subject to section 21-91 shall, as a condition of the receipt of such aid, hire any and all employees for all jobs covered by section 21-92 and in accordance with section 21-94 for the term of such aid. 
(b)  Any project that receives aid from or through the city as defined by section 21-91 shall, as a condition of the receipt of such aid, hire any and all employees for all jobs covered by section 21-92 and in accordance with section 21-94 for the duration of the project. 
(c)  All city agencies and/or departments issuing applications, requests for proposals, contracts, loans, and/or bid specifications shall include a notice of first source obligations for covered employers pursuant to section 21-91 and covered jobs pursuant to section 21-92 and require any recipient of any aid as defined in section 21-91 to affirmatively acknowledge their, and any of their subcontractor's obligations to comply with this section. 
(d)  Any employer, entity and/or business subject to section 21-91 shall, as a condition of the receipt of such aid, identify in all relevant advertising and job applications that they are a first source covered employer and allow the city or its designee to periodically audit relevant records of their entity reasonably related to the employer's, entity's, and/or business's compliance with this section. 
(e)  Covered employers shall comply with federal equal employment opportunity policies on non-discrimination for those with prison records. Whenever an employer is in receipt of information which is part of an employment applicant's or employee's criminal history record information file, he or she may use that information for the purpose of deciding whether or not to hire the applicant or fire the employee, only in accordance with this section, unless such denial of employment or termination is required by municipal, state or federal law. 
(1)  Convictions should only be considered by the employer to the extent that they reasonably relate to the applicant's suitability for employment in the position for which they have applied or in which they are in, that is, where there is a justified business necessity. In determining whether a justified business necessity exists, the employer must consider: 
a.  The gravity of the offense or offenses; 
b.  The time that has passed since the conviction and/or completion of the sentence; and 
c.  The nature of the job held or sought. 
(2)  Process. In the case when an individual is being denied employment as a result of a business necessity as described above, the employer is required to give written notification to the individual being denied or fired, explaining the reasons why he/she was denied employment, and informing him/her of the right to appeal to the director or his/her designee. 
(Ord. 2012, ch. 2012-27, § 1, 6-7-12) 
Sec. 21-94. - First source oversight.

(d)  The director, in conjunction with other appropriate government agencies, shall be responsible for recruiting, training, and advertising no less frequently than once every three (3) months the existence of said list and the method by which a person may be included on such list. Advertising shall be in a newspaper of general circulation or on the city website as well as any other method deemed appropriate by the first source director and shall also include notification of any and all public job placement and referral agencies in the City of Providence.

(1)  Within ten (10) days of being notified by the entity or employer, the director or his/her designee shall refer appropriately trained and qualified persons from the first source list or any other source to said employer until the employer has filled such jobs from the first source list or with bona fide City of Providence residents, giving preference to the length of time residents have been on the list. 
(2)  In the event that the director does not notify the entity or employer within the ten-day period, or the entity or employer is unable to find qualified employees after exhausting all of the appropriately trained and qualified persons to, the employer shall notify the director or his/her designee that it wishes to seek outside employees. 
(3)  The director or his/her designee shall have ten (10) days to meet with the employer after the employer notifies the director. If the director or his/her designee does not meet with the employer within ten (10) days of being notified, the employer may hire individuals not included on the list. If they meet and, after conference, the employer and director or his/her designee agree that the director or his/her designee, is unable to provide suitable employees for said positions, the director or his/her designee shall permit the covered employer in writing to hire workers not found on the first source list or who are not bona fide City of Providence residents. 
(4)  If the employer and director or his/her designee do not agree that the director or his/her designee is able to find suitable employees, the director or his/her designee shall be given an additional ten (10) days to recruit employees for such positions. If at the end of ten (10) days the director or his/her designee is unable to find suitable employees, the director or his/her designee shall permit the covered employer in writing to hire workers not found on the first source list or who are not bona fide City of Providence residents. 
(5)  At the sole discretion of the director or his/her designee, an employer may be exempted from the provisions of this article if the employer has an emergency hiring requirement, or if the employer can certify that it has otherwise hired a bona fide City of Providence resident or a person on the first source list for a job covered in section 21-92 that should have been subject to the process in section 21-94. 
(f)  The director may also develop targeted career and industry pathways for residents on the first source list and establish training and referral programs for such persons and notify all persons on the first source list of such programs. Selection for such training programs shall be in accordance with the following guidelines: the director or his/her designee shall strive to place a proportionate share of women, minorities and persons with disabilities in all training and job opportunities. The goals will be fifty (50) percent women, fifty (50) percent minorities, and five (5) percent persons with disabilities. 
(g)  Training and referral programs may be established at regular intervals and may be in the following areas: 
(1)  Any area in which a covered employer who expects to be hiring has expressed a need exists.

(3)  Basic training in the skills and work habits necessary for successful and continued employment for any person on the first source list whom the agency identifies as lacking such skills. 
(h)  The director shall prepare and make available on the city's website, as well as to the internal auditor, the city council and to the public, a quarterly report containing the following information commencing with the city's fiscal year on July 1:

(i)  The director shall promulgate a citizen complaint form with which any person on the first source list or bona fide Providence resident may register a complaint against any employer, entity and/or business alleged to be in violation of this article.

Upon installation of updated or replacement lighting, obsolete or abandoned fixtures and equipment shall be removed. 
b.  In addition to these requirements, installations must meet all criteria required by law in historic districts or areas governed by design criteria, especially as it relates to the design of the proposed fixture and related equipment exposed to view, dimensions, finish color, hardware and methods of mounting. 
c.  In open spaces or open parking lots, lighting shall be designed to provide the minimum lighting necessary to ensure adequate vision, safety and comfort in parking areas and not to cause glare, deep shadows or direct illumination on adjacent properties or streets. In enclosed parking structures, lighting fixtures shall be designed and shielded so that light is not radiated directly through wall openings, windows, entrances and exits causing glare and negatively impacting surrounding streets and properties. Lighting fixtures in open spaces or open parking lots shall utilize metal halide and/or fluorescent bulbs. 
d.  The use of general floodlighting fixtures for security purposes shall be discouraged and shall not qualify for the tax stabilization. 
e.  In order to apply for the tax stabilization, the building inspector must approve the lighting plan and find that the illumination adds to the overall design of the building or site, that it does not obscure, damage or detract from significant architectural or landscape features, that it adds to the visual quality of the surrounding neighborhood and that it does not produce dangerous or annoying glare or unwanted illumination of nearby properties and that the lighting is sufficient in color and intensity to provide adequate illumination for vehicles and pedestrians while minimizing glare. A permit shall be required for installation of exterior lighting fixtures. 
f.  No person shall be entitled to any exemption herein authorized without first filing an application for such exemption with the office of the city assessor. The fee for such application shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). The application shall include the program of building, alterations and/or improvements to be made. The city assessor shall promptly forward a copy of any application to the building inspector and notify the city collector of the pendency of the exemption application. 
g.  The building inspector shall review the application to determine whether any violations of the provisions of the building code of the city ordinance exist with respect to the property of the applicant and any other property in the city owned by the applicant. If no violations exist, he shall certify that fact to the city assessor within fifteen (15) days. If violations do exist, he shall forward a statement stating the nature and extent of the violations. No exemption granted thereunder shall be effective unless and until any and all such violations have been cured. 
h.  The city collector shall review the city tax records to determine whether all taxes (together with interest and penalties) which are due and owing to the city with respect to the property to which the exemption applies, and all other property in the city owned by the applicant, have been paid. If no deficiency exists, the city collector shall certify that fact to the city assessor within fifteen (15) days. If a deficiency or deficiencies do exist, the city collector shall forward a statement of the amounts due and the properties involved. No exemption granted hereunder shall be effective unless and until any and all taxes together with interest and penalties remaining unpaid and due and owing to the city assessed on such property have been paid in full to the city. 
i.  Within thirty (30) days following the receipt of the statements from the building inspector and the city collector, the assessor will review the application and, if the building inspector and city collector have certified that no violations or deficiencies or any which did exist have been cured, he/she will forward the application to the board of tax assessment review, which will review the application and if the building inspector and city collector have certified that no violations or deficiencies exist, it shall forward to the city council together with its comments and recommendations for action by the city council. The city council shall review the project in its entirety, including but not limited to, the amount of public funds utilized in the project in determining whether or not a project shall be approved. Approval by the council shall be by resolution. 
(c)  Exemption. Upon receipt from the city assessor of an application for abatement under this article, the city council may grant the exemption provided for herein or any such lessor or greater exemption, upon its finding that the granting of such exemption will benefit the city for any of the reasons set forth in subsection (a) above. The commercial, industrial or residential property that is exempt shall be assessed as follows: An exemption shall be granted in the amount of fifty (50) percent of the cost of prospective projects, including design and installation, not to exceed seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00). Said exemption shall be allowed pro-rata over a seven-year period. Said lighting improvements shall not increase the assessment of the building by the amount of the lighting. Provided, however, seasonal and holiday lighting shall not be included. Additionally, in no event shall the exemption exceed fifteen (15) percent of the total assessed value of the property if said property is residential nor ten (10) percent of the total assessed value of the property if said property is commercial or industrial. 
Additionally, the grant of any exemption hereunder shall benefit public safety through illumination of city rights-of-way and shall be specifically predicated upon the applicant agreeing that: 
(1)  The lighting be designed and installed to illuminate the project and specifically the whole of the streetside facade of the subject building, and 
(2)  Any erection refurbishment of on-street illumination shall, in order to qualify for any such exemption shall:

(5)  Transfer of exempt property. If property for which an exemption has been granted is transferred during the exemption period, the exemption shall run with the property and benefit the transferee so long as the property continues to be used for commercial or industrial or residential purposes and the transferee could otherwise qualify for an exemption if the transferee had filed the original application. 
(6)  Revocation. The city council may terminate an exemption granted hereunder prior to the expiration thereof in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by an applicant regarding any statements or representations contained in the application filed hereunder on in the event said owner otherwise fails to comply with the requirements hereof.

(Ord. 2001, ch. 01-20, 5-10-01) 
Sec. 21-171. - Downcity tax district. 
(a)  Authority. The city council has the authority under the General Laws to create a Downcity tax district to provide special tax considerations for designated properties within the district, as defined below. Private investment is needed to rehabilitate and construct buildings as well as to introduce economically viable uses to the area, but investment has been insufficient because of the high cost of renovation and difficulty in obtaining commercial tenants. It is therefore in the public interest to provide property tax incentives for owners of under-utilized property in the Downcity district in order that there may be substantial rehabilitation of the properties and attract new residential, commercial and institutional uses. It is also in the public interest to offer these incentives for a limited duration. 
(b)  Eligible property. Eligible properties shall be taxable properties located within the area bounded by Dorrance, Pine, Empire and Sabin Streets within the city; and shall have been more than fifty (50) percent vacant as of December 31, 1999 or, although more than fifty (50) percent occupied, shall be eligible if certified by the city building inspector as in need of substantial rehabilitation. 
Buildings demolished after December 31, 1999 shall be ineligible. Properties already vacant as of this date shall be eligible if the owners construct new structures, including parking garages. 
Property taxes levied on eligible properties as of December 31, 2000 shall reflect the adopted tax considerations. Owners of eligible properties are required to begin renovations by December 31, 2003 in order to qualify for continued tax considerations. Properties that fail to meet this deadline will be required retroactively to pay the difference between their actual tax payments and what they would have paid if ineligible for the specified tax considerations. 
Substantial rehabilitation shall mean rehabilitation that adheres to the applicable building and fire codes, extends to all occupiable floors of the building, and equals at least, fifty (50) percent of the current replacement value of the structure, as certified by the city building inspector. 
(c)  Tax considerations. The city shall provide tax considerations for a period beginning with the assessments of December 31, 2000 up to and including December 31, 2010. During this period, eligible properties shall pay annual taxes on land and buildings in an amount equal to the tax assessed as of December 31, 1998. This tax shall be fixed regardless of changes in the tax rate, or of changes in valuation resulting from periodic revaluation. During this period of eligibility, the tax shall be fixed regardless of increased property value resulting form substantial rehabilitation. 
During the period of eligibility, the city shall also use special considerations in taxing tangible property located in businesses in eligible properties. This tax consideration shall not be available for any business relocating from another area of the city unless that business has been involuntarily relocated or has been relocated as a result of a catastrophic occurrence. This shall apply, however, to expansion projects by businesses already located within this area. For the ten-year period, the rate of thirty-three dollars and forty-four cents ($33.44) shall be applied annually to tangible property value as it is determined and any change from year to year. This consideration shall apply to all taxable businesses occupying eligible properties during the period of eligibility, regardless of when they first occupied the property. 
(d)  Transfer of exempt or stabilized property. Tax benefits for eligible properties shall be transferable to new owners or tenants, but the life of the tax consideration shall not be extended. 
(e)  Other considerations. This section shall not diminish the authority of any body to review and approve the construction plans for overall appearance or historical preservation standards. This section shall not limit or otherwise preclude the city council from also exempting or stabilizing taxes on properties which would otherwise be permitted by the General Laws or by this Code of Ordinances, including but not limited to section 21-169. In the event another exemption or stabilization program is applied to the eligible property, the annual taxes on land and buildings would be the amount equal to the tax assessed as of December 31, 1998 and that will serve as the assessed valuation of the property from which the abatement shall be computed. 
(f)  Forms and procedure. The city assessor shall develop forms and procedures as he or she deems necessary and proper. The procedure for eligible properties under this section shall be the same as in section 21-169(b)(1). 
(g)  Revocation. The city council shall terminate an exemption granted hereunder prior to the expiration thereof in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by an applicant regarding any statements or representations contained in the application.

Sec. 21-172. - Property taxes for designated properties. 
(a)  Authorization. The city council has the authority under the General Laws of the State of Rhode Island to provide special tax considerations for designated projects, as defined below. Private investment is needed to rehabilitate buildings as well as to introduce economically viable uses for these buildings, but investment has been insufficient because of the high cost of renovation and difficulty in obtaining commercial tenants. It is therefore in the public interest to provide property tax incentives for owners of designated properties on the landmark list, as defined below, as part of the mill restoration program and in the arts and entertainment district in order that there may be substantial rehabilitation of the properties and attract residential, commercial and institutional uses. It is also in the public interest to offer these incentives for a limited duration. 
(b)  Eligible property. Eligible properties shall be properties designated on the landmark list as part of the mill restoration program and in the arts and entertainment district in the city as approved by the city council and shall be eligible if certified by the city building inspector as in need of substantial rehabilitation. "Substantial rehabilitation" shall mean rehabilitation that adheres to the applicable building and fire codes, extends to all occupiable floors of the building, and equals at least fifty (50) percent of the current replacement value of the structure, as certified by the city building inspector. Upon enactment, property taxes levied on eligible properties as of December 31, 2000 shall reflect the adopted tax considerations. Owners of eligible properties are required to begin renovations by December 31, 2005 in order to qualify for continued tax considerations. Properties that fail to meet this deadline will be required retroactively to pay the difference between their actual tax payments and what they would have paid if ineligible for the specified tax considerations. 
(c)  Tax considerations. The city shall provide tax considerations for a period beginning with the assessments of December 31, 2001 up to and including December 31, 2011. During this period, eligible properties shall pay annual taxes on land and buildings in an amount equal to the tax assessed as of December 31, 2000. This tax shall be fixed regardless of changes in the tax rate, or of changes in valuation resulting from periodic revaluation. During this period of eligibility, the tax shall be fixed regardless of increased property value resulting form substantial rehabilitation. During the period of eligibility, the city shall also use special considerations in taxing tangible property located in businesses in eligible properties. This tax consideration shall not be available for any business relocating from another area of the city unless that business has been involuntarily relocated or has been relocated as a result of a catastrophic occurrence. This shall apply, however, to expansion projects by businesses already located within this area. For the ten-year period, the rate of thirty-three dollars and forty-four cents ($33.44) shall be applied annually to tangible property value as it is determined and any change from year to year. This consideration shall apply to all taxable businesses occupying eligible properties during the period of eligibility, regardless of when they first occupied the property. 
(d)  Transfer of exempt or stabilized property. Tax benefits for eligible properties shall be transferable to new owners or tenants, but the life of the tax consideration shall not be extended. 
(e)  Other considerations. This section shall not diminish the authority of any body to review and approve the construction plans for overall appearance or historical preservation standards. This section shall not limit or otherwise preclude the city council from also exempting or stabilizing taxes on properties which would otherwise be permitted by the General Laws of the State of Rhode Island or by this code of ordinances, including but not limited to section 21-169. In the event another exemption or stabilization program is applied to the eligible property, the annual taxes on land and buildings would be the amount equal to the tax assessed as of December 31, 1998 and that will serve as the assessed valuation of the property from which the abatement shall be computed. 
(f)  Forms and procedure. The city assessor shall develop forms and procedures as he or she deems necessary and proper. The procedure for eligible properties under this section shall be the same as in section 21-169(b)(1). 
(g)  Revocation. The city council shall terminate an exemption granted hereunder prior to the expiration thereof in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by an applicant regarding any statements or representations contained in the application.

ARTICLE X. - PROPERTY TAX CLASSIFICATION FOR THE CITY 

Sec. 21-181. - Property tax classification. 
    The city hereby adopts a system of classification of taxable property in conformity with the provisions of R.I.G.L. § 44-5-11.8 effective for taxes assessed as of December 31, 2000. The system of classification of taxable property and homestead exemption adopted in accordance with [R.I.G.L.] § 44-5-11.8 shall continue until terminated by ordinance adopted by the city council. 
(Ord. 1988, ch. 88-27, § 1, 7-1-88; Ord. 2001, ch. 01-25, § 1, 7-24-01; Ord. 2002, ch. 02-8, § 1, 3-12-02; Ord. 2002, ch. 02-24, § 1, 7-31-02) 
Sec. 21-182. - Apportionment of taxes. 
(a)  Limited adoption. The tax classification plan is hereby adopted with the following limitations: 
(1)  The designated classes of property shall be limited to the four (4) classes as defined in subsection (b) hereof. 
(2)  The tax rate for class 2 shall not exceed the tax rate of class 1 by more than two hundred (200) percent, without regard to the owner-occupied status; the tax rate applicable to class 3 shall not exceed the nonowner-occupied tax rate of class 1 by more than two hundred (200) percent. 
(3)  Effective fiscal year 2016, the rate for the nonowner-occupied properties of class 1 type (b) nonowner-occupied shall not exceed the owner-occupied tax rate of class 1 type (a) owner-occupied by more than sixty (60) percent. 
(4)  Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) hereof, the tax rate applicable to wholesale and retail inventory within class 3 as defined in subsection (b) hereof, are governed by R.I.G.L. § 44-3-19.1. 
(5)  Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) hereof, tax rates applicable to motor vehicles within class 4 as defined in subsection (b) hereof, are governed by R.I.G.L. § 44-34.1-1. 
(6)  The provisions of R.I.G.L. ch. 35 of tit. 44 relating to property tax and fiscal disclosure applies to the reporting of and compliance with these classifications. 
(b)  Classes of property. 
(1)  Class 1. Residential real estate consisting of no more than five (5) dwelling units, land classified as open space, and dwellings on leased land including mobile homes. This class may also include residential properties containing partial commercial or business uses with no more than five (5) dwelling units. For the properties with both residential and commercial or business uses, the residential tax rate will be applied to the residential portion and the commercial tax rate will be applied to the commercial portion. This class shall be further subdivided into (a) owner-occupied and (b) non-owner occupied properties. 
The granting of an application for an owner-occupied or nonowner-occupied rate as referenced above as type (a) or (b) is subject to the following limitations: 
a.  To be eligible for a type (a) or (b) rate, effective as to the assessment date of December 31 at midnight, an applicant must file with the city assessor no later than March 15 a homestead application, together with a declaration, and present evidence, under oath, as to the owner-occupied or nonowner-occupied status together with any other proof of residency or ownership and the ownership of all motor vehicles registered either with the State of Rhode Island or with any foreign state, and to provide that information in any manner which may be required by the city assessor; except, that in the case of new construction of, or renovation of no less than thirty (30) percent of the prior year's assessment of improvements, as certified by the Providence building official, of foreclosed upon existing structures for affordable owner-occupied residential property, eligibility for the owner-occupied rate shall be determined upon application on or after the date of the execution of a purchase and sales agreement for a specific property, but no later than sixty (60) days of its sale, applied on a pro rata basis for the remainder of the current tax year as if the owner-occupied rate had been granted as of the prior December 31 assessment date. "Affordable residential property" shall mean property determined to be affordable under the rules and regulations of the department of planning and development. For good cause, the city assessor may, with advice of the board of tax assessment review, accept applications for owner-occupied status after the filing deadline for the current or previous year's taxes only. 
b.  Only natural person(s) are qualified to receive a type (a) owner-occupied residential real estate rate. Real property which is partially or wholly owned by a business, an institution, a nonprofit organization, a financial institution that has foreclosed on real estate, including, without limitation, HUD and Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corporation, or any other such public or private entity, do not qualify for a type (a) owner-occupied real estate rate; provided, however, that with respect to the application of the owner-occupied real estate rate to taxes assessed as of December 31, 2012, the city assessor may, with the advice of the board of tax assessment review, accept an application and grant a type (a) owner-occupied real estate rate to an entity and its shareholder(s)/member(s)/owner(s), as the case may be, upon receiving a sworn declaration from said person(s) that he/she/they primarily resided in the subject real estate as of December 31, 2012, and that the ownership of the subject property is in said entity's name solely for estate purposes. 
c.  Applicants may qualify only for one (1) type (a) owner-occupied real estate rate in the city at any one (1) point in time. In addition, an owner of real estate in the City of Providence must meet all of the following requirements in order to qualify for a type (a) owner-occupied rate: 
1.  Neither the owner-occupied rate applicant nor the applicant's spouse is receiving an owner-occupied rate for another piece of real property, located elsewhere in the State of Rhode Island, or in any other state of the United States, for the same period of time the owner is seeking the owner-occupied rate for property owned in Providence, unless during that time the owner is either legally separated or divorced from the spouse during some or all of the period in which they are claiming more than one (1) owner-occupied rate; 
2.  The owner-occupied rate applicant, and the owner-occupied rate applicant's spouse, is paying the Providence excise tax due on each and every motor vehicle owned by either one when that vehicle is garaged more than thirty (30) days in the State of Rhode Island, unless (a) the vehicle is registered in the name of the applicant's spouse, and (b) the owner-occupied-rate applicant and the spouse are either legally separated or divorced; 
3.  The owner-occupied rate applicant has filed with the Providence Tax Assessor a current listing of all motor vehicles with foreign registrations that the applicant owns as required by R.I.G.L. § 31-7-1. If a homeowner currently receiving the owner-occupied rate has at least one (1) motor vehicle registered to the same address as the property receiving the rate, then the tax collector shall presume that these requirements have been complied with; however, the tax collector shall have the authority to investigate whether other circumstances (such as the ownership of additional motor vehicles registered elsewhere) indicate noncompliance that overcomes this presumption. If a homeowner currently receiving the owner-occupied rate does not have any motor vehicles registered to the same address, the tax collector may take appropriate action to ascertain compliance with these requirements and to revoke the owner-occupied rate, both prospectively and retroactively as necessary to the enactment of this section. 
4.  The rate, either type (a) or (b), attaches to the owner(s) of the real property not to the real property itself. 
5.  The city assessor shall deny an application for the owner-occupied rate if the city assessor determines that an execution of record based upon a judgment of the housing court for a real estate code violation(s) against the applicant remains unsatisfied. 
6.  Upon purchase of a residence, a homeowner may apply for a type (a) owner-occupied real estate tax rate effective as of the date of purchase for the current tax year, notwithstanding the fact that applicant did not own the property as of December 31 of the prior year. The exemption will be granted pro rata for the number of days the applicant owns the property during the fiscal year in which the home is purchased. In the event the property granted an owner-occupied rate is sold or transferred during the year for which the owner-occupied rate is claimed, the applicable rate is void for that portion of the year following the sale or transfer should the new buyer not qualify for the owner-occupied rate. The buyer or transferee shall be liable to the city for any tax benefit received after the date of sale or transfer. 
7.  If the taxpayer knowingly gives misinformation as to ownership and/or occupancy of the real estate and/or ownership of motor vehicles on his/her application for an owner-occupied rate, the city assessor may, in such event, remove the owner-occupied rate and apply the non-owner occupied rate and recalculate the tax for the period in question and in addition charge the taxpayer the maximum interest permitted by law. If the taxpayer provides incorrect information, knowingly or not, the city assessor may remove the owner-occupied rate and apply the non-owner occupied rate and may impose back taxes up to the full amount owed for the period in question. 
8.  The city assessor is empowered to promulgate any further rules and regulations which he/she deems necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this section as it relates to the owner-occupied and non-owner occupied rates. 
(2)  Class 2. Commercial and industrial real estate, residential properties containing partial commercial or business uses and residential real estate of more than five (5) dwelling units. Properties containing partial commercial or business uses and residential real estate of more than five (5) dwelling units shall be included in class 2. 
(3)  Class 3. All ratable tangible personal property. 
(4)  Class 4. Motor vehicles and trailers subject to the excise tax created by General Laws, Chapter 34 of Title 44. For FY 2013, the motor vehicle tax exemption shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The rate of taxation shall be sixty dollars ($60.00) per thousand of assessed value less any applicable reductions. 
(c)  The city, pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws 44-5-11.8(c), as amended, adopts a tax rate for class 2 which shall exceed the tax rate of class 1; the tax rate applicable to class 3 shall not exceed the non-owner occupied tax rate of class 1 by more than two hundred (200) percent.

(Ord. 2004, ch. 04-35, § 1, 8-13-04) 
Sec. 21-235. - Property taxes for designated historic properties. 
(a)  Authorization. The city council has the authority under R.I.G.L. § 44-3-9 to exempt from tax payment, in whole or in part, real and personal property which has undergone environmental remediation, is historically preserved, or is used for affordable housing, manufacturing, commercial, or residential purposes, or to determine a stabilized amount of taxes to be paid on account of the property, notwithstanding the valuation of the property or the rate of tax. 
(b)  Purpose. For the city to grow economically, it is essential that the many historic commercial and industrial buildings be returned to productive use. The high cost of rehabilitating these buildings for productive use is prohibitively expensive and cannot be achieved with private investment alone. It is therefore in the public interest to provide property tax incentives for owners of designated properties in order that there may be substantial rehabilitation of the properties for residential, commercial and institutional uses. The result being an improvement of the physical plant of the city which will result in a long-term economic benefit to the city. 
(c)  Eligible properties. Eligible properties shall include any building listed on the Providence Industrial and Commercial Buildings District, a local historic district (as approved by the city council), the jewelry manufacturing district, a national historic district, and any building located in the arts and entertainment district defined, for the purposes of this section, as that area bounded by Empire Street to Sabin Street to Exchange Terrace to Memorial Boulevard to Friendship Street. 
(d)  Criteria. For a property to be eligible for this tax stabilization program, the property must be in need of substantial rehabilitation. "Substantial rehabilitation" shall mean rehabilitation that adheres to the applicable building and fire codes, extends to all occupiable floors of the building, and equals at least fifty (50) percent of the current replacement value of the structure. The director of department of inspections and standards shall make the determination whether the subject property will involve substantial rehabilitation, in accordance with subsection (h)(2) below. Owners of eligible properties are required to begin renovations within twelve (12) months of the execution of the subject stabilization agreement and to obtain a certificate of occupancy for such renovations within thirty-six (36) months of the commencement of the renovation. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, a temporary certificate of occupancy shall be sufficient. Owners of properties that fail to meet any of these deadlines will be required retroactively to pay the difference between their actual stabilized tax payments and what they would have paid if ineligible for the specified tax considerations (unless an extension of such applicable deadline is approved by the city council). 
(e)  Stabilization period. In order to allow sufficient time for construction and project stabilization, following approval of an eligible property for tax stabilization in accordance with this section, the stabilization shall last for a period of twelve (12) years from the date the subject stabilization agreement is executed. 
(f)  Tax considerations. Upon enactment, property taxes levied on eligible properties approved for special tax consideration shall be in an amount equal to the lower of: (i) thirty-five cents ($0.35) per square foot, or (ii) the tax assessed as of December 31, 2010. During the stabilization period, the annual taxes on the subject land and buildings shall be fixed regardless of changes in: the tax rate; valuation resulting from periodic revaluation; or increased property value resulting from substantial rehabilitation. 
(g)  Transfer of exempt or stabilized property. Tax benefits for eligible properties shall be transferable to new owners or tenants, but the duration of the tax consideration period shall not be extended (unless otherwise approved by the city council). In the event that the tax stabilized property becomes exempt from real estate taxes during the term of tax stabilization through conveyance, or otherwise, to a real estate tax exempt entity, the tax stabilization agreement shall be void ab initio with owners of tax stabilized properties being liable for full taxes retroactively to the execution date of the tax stabilization agreement. 
(h)  Forms and procedure. The city assessor, together with the director of the department of planning and development, shall develop forms and additional procedures consistent with this section, as they deem necessary and proper to effectuate the terms and provisions of this section. The procedure for eligible properties under this section shall be as follows: 
(1)  No person shall be entitled to any exemption herein authorized without first filing an application for tax stabilization with the office of the city assessor. The application shall include the program of building, alterations and/or improvements to be made. The applicant shall include a statement outlining measures to comply with the city's First Source Agreements Ordinance, article III1/2 of chapter 21 of the Code of Ordinances, and a statement regarding the hiring of minority and women business enterprises (MBE/WBE) pursuant to section 21-52 of the Code of Ordinances.

If violations do exist, within said thirty (30) days, he or she shall forward a statement to the city assessor and the applicant specifying the nature and extent of the violations.

Subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (j) below, nothing shall prohibit the subject property owner from reapplying for tax consideration. 
(3)  The city collector shall review the city tax records to determine whether all taxes (together with interest and penalties) which are due and owing to the city with respect to the property to which the exemption may apply, and all other property in the city owned by the applicant, have been paid. If no deficiency exists, the city collector shall certify that fact to the city assessor within thirty (30) days. If a deficiency or deficiencies do exist, the city collector, within said thirty (30) days, shall forward a statement of the amounts due and the properties involved to the city assessor and the applicant. No exemption granted hereunder shall be effective unless and until any and all taxes together with interest and penalties remaining unpaid and due and owing to the city assessed on such property have been paid in full to the city. 
The applicant shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of written notice (or copy of notice to the city assessor) of a deficiency or deficiencies to pay any and all amounts due to the city. Failure by the applicant to make such payment(s) within said thirty-day period shall result in the city assessor removing the subject application from the assessor's list (as more specifically set forth in subsection (j) below) as an incomplete application. Subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (j) below, nothing shall prohibit the subject property owner from reapplying for tax consideration. 
(4)  The director of the department of planning and development shall review the application to determine whether it satisfactorily addresses the city's First Source Agreements Ordinance and MBE/WBE Ordinance. If no material deficiency exists, the director of the department of planning and development shall certify that fact to the city assessor within thirty (30) days. If a material deficiency exists, the director of the department of planning and development, within said thirty (30) days, shall forward a statement to the city assessor and the applicant specifying the nature and extent of the material deficiency. 
The applicant shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of written notice (or copy of notice to the city assessor) to cure any material deficiency noted by the director if the department of planning and development. Failure by the applicant to resolve such material deficiency within said thirty-day period shall result in the city assessor removing the subject application from the assessor's list (as more specifically set forth in subsection (j) below) as an incomplete application. Subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (j) below, nothing shall prohibit the subject property owner from reapplying for tax consideration. 
NOTE: Steps (2), (3) and (4) shall be performed concurrently. 
(5)  Within fifteen (15) days following the receipt of the statements from the director of department of inspections and standards, city collector, and director of the department of planning and development, the assessor will review the application and, if the foregoing requirements set forth in subsections (h)(1)-(4) have been met (as evidenced by the required certifications and determinations of the assessor, director of department of inspections and standards, city collector and director of department of planning and development, as more particularly set forth above), the assessor shall enter into a tax stabilization agreement with the applicant pursuant to, and upon the terms set forth in this section. Promptly following the enactment of this section, the city assessor will prepare a form tax stabilization agreement to be used in connection with the program set forth in this section, and to be executed by the city assessor upon the approval of an eligible property. 
(i)  Revocation. The city council shall terminate an exemption granted hereunder prior to the expiration thereof in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by an applicant regarding any statements or representations contained in the application. 
(j)  Number of projects. The number of tax stabilization agreements issued in connection with this section shall be limited to ten (10). Applications shall be considered on a first-come, first-served basis (considering only those applications that are deemed complete by the city assessor). The city assessor shall keep a list of all applications filed, and shall remove from such list all applications that are deemed incomplete (whether initially by the city assessor, or as a result of the processes set forth in subsection (h) above). Upon removal from the city assessor's list, the city assessor shall provide the applicant with notice of such action. The applicant shall not be prejudiced from reapplying for tax consideration. The foregoing number may be increased by approval of the city council.

(d)  Federal, state and municipal subsidies such as historic tax credits, tax increment financing, and tax stabilization have succeeded in attracting real estate investment. 
(e)  Major redevelopment of ICBD buildings has occurred accounting for the dislocation of hundreds of small businesses. 
(f)  To insure a balance between the long term economic growth that small businesses provide and the growth of the city's tax and job base that new development brings there is established the ICBD tenant relocation program.

The city council has the authority, under R.I.G.L. § 44-3-9, as amended, to exempt from tax payment, in whole or in part, real and personal property which has undergone environmental remediation, is historically preserved, or is used for affordable housing, manufacturing, commercial, or residential purposes, or to determine a stabilized amount of taxes to be paid on account of the property, notwithstanding the valuation of the property or the rate of tax. 
(b)  Purpose . In order to increase the pace of economic development, and thereby increase the city's tax base, it is vital that city provide property developers, entrepreneurs and investors with a predictable tax phase-in plan that will encourage investment in Providence. It is therefore in the public interest to develop a set of clear criteria for eligibility for tax stabilization, as well as a defined long-term plan to bring a project to full taxation. 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, § 1, 7-23-15) 
Sec. 21-261. - Eligible properties. 
    Eligible properties shall: 
(1)  Be located on land as defined in R.I.G.L. 37-5-8 and 42-64.14-4 ("I-195 redevelopment district") and may include properties that directly abut and are contiguous with I-195 redevelopment land, as defined in R.I.G.L. 42-64.14-15; or 
(2)  Be located on undeveloped land within the Capital Center special development district, as defined in chapter 2, article XXIII, section 2-362 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Providence; and 
(3)  Include new construction (excluding land acquisition costs) with a construction valuation of at least ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00); or the rehabilitation of commercial or multi-family residential property with a cost of construction of at least ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00). 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, § 1, 7-23-15) 
Sec. 21-262. - Criteria. 
    The director of department of inspections and standards shall make the determination whether the subject property or project meets the minimum requirements in accordance with section 21-261. Owners of eligible properties and projects are required to begin construction within twelve (12) months and complete construction within three (3) years of the effective date of the subject stabilization. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, a temporary certificate of occupancy shall be sufficient. Owners of properties and projects that fail to meet any of these deadlines will be required retroactively to pay the difference between their actual stabilized tax payments and what they would have paid if ineligible for the specified tax considerations. The owner may, twelve (12) months prior to the applicable deadline, submit a request to the city council for approval of an extension to such applicable deadline. 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, § 1, 7-23-15) 
Sec. 21-263. - Tax considerations and stabilization period. 
(a)  Commercial and residential projects-Standard . The tax assessor shall determine the land valuation at project site, prior to commencement of the stabilization period. The tax assessor will then establish the "base land tax" based on the valuation. Should a project or portion of a project site be subject to property taxes prior to the commencement of the stabilization period, that tax amount shall be considered as the "base tax." Assessed tax payments upon enactment of the base land tax will begin in year two (2) of the stabilization period and be frozen for three (3) years. The assessor shall issue a bill beginning in the fifth tax year after the commencement date, based upon the property's valuation at that time. Tax payments will be calculated as a percentage of the total tax at the annual tax rate, with a phased-in schedule, as shown below. Projects described in this subsection shall require a signed agreement, between the applicant and the city. Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the department of inspection and standards, the city assessor shall assess the project, and the project shall be reassessed according to the city's regular revaluation cycle. In order to allow sufficient time for construction and project stabilization, following approval of an eligible property for tax stabilization in accordance with this ordinance, the stabilization shall last for a period of fifteen (15) years from the date the subject stabilization agreement is executed. Stabilized annual property tax payments on properties defined in section 21-261(a) that are outside the I-195 redevelopment district shall be calculated by the tax assessor and may not be less than the annual real property taxes paid in any of the three (3) years prior to the commencement of the stabilization period. 
Year Schedule 1 $0/Base tax (if applicable) 2 Base tax and/or base land tax 3 Base tax and/or base land tax 4 Base tax and/or base land tax 5 Base tax and/or base land tax + 5% of increase to assessed valuation 6 Base tax and/or base land tax + 10% of increase to assessed valuation 7 Base tax and/or base land tax + 20% of increase to assessed valuation 8 Base tax and/or base land tax + 30% of increase to assessed valuation 9 Base tax and/or base land tax + 40% of increase to assessed valuation 10 Base tax and/or base land tax + 50% of increase to assessed valuation 11 Base tax and/or base land tax + 60% of increase to assessed valuation 12 Base tax and/or base land tax + 70% of increase to assessed valuation 13 Base tax and/or base land tax + 80% of increase to assessed valuation 14 Base tax and/or base land tax + 90% of increase to assessed valuation 15 Full taxation  
(b)  Commercial projects-Job creation . New construction of commercial property on land in the I-195 redevelopment district with a cost of construction of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00), may be eligible for a tax stabilization period of twenty (20) years under the following criteria: 
(1)  The first five (5) projects authorized by the I-195 redevelopment district commission with a construction cost of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00) or greater shall be eligible for a tax stabilization period of twenty (20) years through an application process that requires no approvals by the city council or mayor. 
(2)  Subsequent projects after the initial five (5) may be eligible for up to twenty (20) years, the terms of which shall be subject to approval by ordinance by the city council and mayor. Projects with an estimated creation of one hundred fifty (150) or more permanent jobs, will be preferred. 
(3)  The tax assessor shall determine the land valuation at project site, prior to commencement of the stabilization period, for the purpose of establishing a base tax or base land tax, whichever is greater. Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the department of inspection and standards, the tax assessor shall assess the project, and the project shall be reassessed according to the city's regular revaluation cycle. 
    Tax payments will be calculated as a percentage of the total tax at the annual tax rate, with a phased-in schedule, as shown below. 
Year Schedule 1 $0/Base tax (if applicable) 2 $0/Base tax (if applicable) 3 $0/Base tax (if applicable) 4 Base and/or base land tax 5 Base and/or base land tax 6 Base and/or base land tax + 6.5% 7 Base and/or base land tax + 13.0% 8 Base and/or base land tax + 19.5% 9 Base and/or base land tax + 26.0% 10 Base and/or base land tax + 32.5% 11 Base and/or base land tax + 39.0% 12 Base and/or base land tax + 45.5% 13 Base and/or base land tax + 52.0% 14 Base and/or base land tax + 58.5% 15 Base and/or base land tax + 65.0% 16 Base and/or base land tax + 71.5% 17 Base and/or base land tax + 78.0% 18 Base and/or base land tax + 84.5% 19 Base and/or base land tax + 91.0% 20 Full taxation  
(Ord. No. 2015-28, § 1, 7-23-15) 
Sec. 21-264. - Transfer of exempt or stabilized property. 
    Tax benefits for eligible properties shall be transferable to new owners or tenants, but the duration of the tax consideration period shall not be extended (unless otherwise approved by the city council). In the event that the tax stabilized property becomes exempt from real estate taxes during the term of tax stabilization through conveyance, or otherwise, to a real estate tax exempt entity, the tax stabilization agreement shall be void ab initio with owners of tax stabilized properties being liable for full taxes retroactively to the execution date of the tax stabilization agreement. 
    In the event that a project owner transfers a project site to a tax exempt entity within the five-year period immediately following the expiration of the agreement, the project owner agrees to pay a percentage of the sale price to the city as follows: five (5) percent of the sale price if the project site is sold to a tax exempt entity in the first year following expiration; four (4) percent of the sale price if sold to a tax exempt entity in the second year; three (3) percent of the sale price if sold to a tax exempt entity in the third year; two (2) percent of the sale price if sold to a tax exempt entity in the fourth year; one (1) percent of the sale price if sold to a tax exempt entity in the fifth year. 
(Ord. No. 2015-28, § 1, 7-23-15)

(a)  Construction . 
(1)  MBE/WBE . The project site owner shall make a good faith effort to award to minority business enterprises as defined in R.I.G.L. § 31-14.1 ("MBE Act") no less than ten (10) percent of the dollar value of the construction costs for the project (as determined in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to MBE Act). The project site owner shall make a good faith effort to award to women business enterprises (WBEs) no less than ten (10) percent of the dollar value of the construction costs for the project (as determined in accordance with section 21-52 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Providence). The project site owner will request the city's MBE/WBE office to establish a list of qualified MBE/WBE companies in order to satisfy its MBE/WBE construction goals. In this manner, the city will assist the project site owner in meeting said goals. The process of participating with the MBE/WBE office shall begin upon passage in order to develop a designated MBE/WBE subcontractor list which will encourage MBE/WBE participation and joint ventures with other members with the construction industry. 
(2)  Apprenticeship . The developer or project owner shall ensure that one hundred (100) percent of the hours worked on the project shall be performed by trade construction subcontractors who have or are affiliated with an apprenticeship program as defined in 29 C.F.R. § 29 et seq. Up to twenty (20) percent of the hourly requirement may be waived if replaced with hours worked by qualified MBE/WBE companies registered in the State of Rhode Island. Certification of this waiver shall be reviewed and signed by the designated MBE/WBE coordinator within the department of purchasing. 
The developer or project owner shall make a requirement in the contracts between its construction manager and general contractor and their subcontractors who have apprenticeship programs as defined in 29 C.F.R. § 29 that not less than ten (10) percent of the total hours worked by the subcontractors' employees on the project are completed by apprentices registered in the aforementioned apprenticeship programs.

The developer or project owner, its construction manager or general contractor or other authorized person/entity may petition the city department of planning and development to adjust the apprenticeship work hour requirements to a lower percentage upon a showing that: 
a.  Compliance is not feasible because a trade or field does not have an apprenticeship program or cannot produce members from its program capable of performing the scope of work within the contract; or 
b.  Compliance is not feasible because it would involve a risk or danger to human health and safety or the public at large; or 
c.  Compliance is not feasible because it would create a significant economic hardship; or 
d.  Compliance is not feasible for any other reason which is justifiable and demonstrates good cause. 
(3)  Internal Revenue Service reporting . Except as provided under R.I.G.L. § 28-42-8, any person performing services at the project site shall annually receive either a W-2 statement or an IRS form 1099. 
(4)  First source list . Pursuant to chapter 21-93 of the code of ordinances of the city, the project site owner shall enter into a first source agreement covering the hiring of employees necessary to complete the proposed project and throughout the term of the tax stabilization agreement. The project site owner shall work in conjunction with the first source director to develop the first source agreement. The owner shall also make a good faith effort to employ Rhode Island and Providence residents for any and all positions not included in its first source obligations, as well as ensure that any general contractor/construction manager and all subcontractors utilized also make good faith efforts to employ Rhode Island and Providence residents for any and all positions not included in their first source obligations. 
(5)  "Buy Providence" initiative . The project site owner will use good faith efforts to ensure that construction materials are purchased from economically competitive and qualified vendors located in the city of Providence. In furtherance of this effort, the project site owner will work with the city to develop a list of Providence vendors and subcontractors in order to create a preferred vendor list of qualified and economically competitive vendors for the construction of the project. Furthermore, once the project site owner constructs the development, the project site owner will use good faith efforts to conduct ongoing business with and provide preference to economically competitive and qualified Providence businesses. 
(6)  In the event that there shall be a failure to comply with this subsection 21-266(a), the department of planning and development shall have standing to seek enforcement of this provision of the ordinance in the Rhode Island Superior Court. The department shall also have the ability to impose a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each day of non-compliance with this section. 
(b)  Permanent employment . In conjunction with its efforts pursuant to this section and its ongoing efforts to provide equal employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, natural origin, sex, age or handicap, the project site owner shall liaise with the city and with the director of first source to assist in the recruitment of qualified minority, women, and handicap applicants as well as those on the first source list for all of its employment positions. 
(c)  Reporting . The project site owner, the director of planning and development, the director of first source, and the a representative of the third party entity monitoring apprenticeship requirements shall annually report to the city council on progress in complying with the provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to, section 21-266.

--- (18) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2016-1, § 1, adopted Jan. 13, 2016, amended Art. XVII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. XVII, §§ 21-271-21-283, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2015-29, § 1, adopted July 23, 2015.   It should be noted that § 2 of said ordinance states that this ordinance shall sunset 30 months from the date of passage. 

Sec. 21-271. - Authorization and purpose. 
(a)  Authorization . The city council has the authority, under R.I.G.L. § 44-3-9, as amended, to exempt from tax payment, in whole or in part, real and personal property which has undergone environmental remediation, is historically preserved, or is used for affordable housing, manufacturing, commercial, or residential purposes, or to determine a stabilized amount of taxes to be paid on account of the property, notwithstanding the valuation of the property or the rate of tax. 
(b)  Purpose . The city recognizes that in order to stabilize neighborhoods, vacant, and/or underutilized properties must be returned to productive use. The purpose of this article is to provide the city with a tool to promote and encourage the use of vacant and/or underutilized property through new construction or rehabilitation of qualifying properties for residential and commercial purposes. In order to advance investment in identified neighborhoods, it is vital that the city provide property developers, entrepreneurs and investors with a predictable tax phase-in plan. It is therefore in the public interest to develop a set of clear criteria for eligibility for a neighborhood revitalization tax stabilization incentive, as well as a defined plan to bring a project to full taxation. 
(Ord. No. 2016-1, § 1, 1-3-16) 
Sec. 21-272. - Eligible properties. 
    Eligible properties shall include new construction (excluding land acquisition costs) or the rehabilitation of commercial, mixed-use, or multi-family residential property of between two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) and three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) in an opportunity neighborhood. 
    Eligible properties shall include properties located in commercial corridors that abut or are contiguous with opportunity neighborhoods. 
    Abutting and contiguous properties within an opportunity neighborhood may be considered a single project for purposes of qualifying for a tax stabilization under this article. 
(Ord. No. 2016-1, § 1, 1-3-16) 
Sec. 21-273. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:]

Owners of eligible properties and projects are required to begin construction within twelve (12) months and to complete construction within twenty-four (24) months of the effective date of the subject stabilization agreement. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, a temporary certificate of occupancy shall be sufficient. Owners of properties and projects that fail to meet any of these deadlines will be required retroactively to pay the difference between their actual stabilized tax payments and what they would have paid if ineligible for the specified tax considerations (unless an extension of such applicable deadline is approved by the city council).

Sec. 23-6. - Opening, excavating, etc., on, in, across or under public roadway or sidewalk. 
(a)  Preamble. The public safety and convenience require both the installation and maintenance of utility services and the maintenance of safe and aesthetically pleasing roadways and sidewalks. These requirements, unfortunately are sometimes in tension. Safe streets and sidewalks are unquestionably necessary and aesthetically pleasing highways are highly desirable. The public, though, has the right to expect the availability and delivery of both existing and improved or new utility services. Such delivery and availability are to be provided, but must be provided in a safe and sound manner. 
The city seeks to allow the delivery of the expected services yet ensure public safety and the quality of life to which the city's citizenry is entitled. That goal requires the balancing of two (2) important dynamics. The city seeks to promote the prompt and safe delivery of old and new services without sacrificing the peoples' safety and convenience. 
(b)  No person, firm or corporation shall in any manner make any opening or excavation on, in, upon or under nor lay any pipe, wire, line or conduit, cable or the like, on, in, across or under any public roadway or sidewalk in the city nor upon any public lands (the jurisdiction over which is not legally reserved to another municipal department) without the prior written consent of the director of public works or his or her designee. 
(c)  No person, firm or corporation shall in any manner place or cause to be placed any sign, equipment, tables, chairs nor any structure, post or footing on, in, upon or under any roadway or sidewalk in the city, nor on, in, upon or under any public land (the jurisdiction over which is not legally reserved to another municipal department) without the prior written approval of the director of public works or his or her designee. 
(d)  The director shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to effect the purpose of this article. The director shall also provide suitable documents to give effect to this article. 
(e)  Sidewalk excavation permits shall be issued only to the record owner of that real estate abutting the sidewalk to be repaired or replaced. Permits required for such intrusion onto the sidewalk shall also be issued only in the name of the record owner of the real estate abutting the sidewalk at which the requested intrusion shall take place; provided, however that the occupant of the realty abutting said sidewalk may be issued such permit in the event that the record owner of the realty grants said abutter authority to apply for such permit. 
Permits for the installation of any pipe, wire, line, conduit, cable or the like under any roadway or sidewalk shall be issued only to the owner of said wire, line, conduit, cable or the like. Said permits are distinct from roadway excavation permits. Permits for roadway excavation for the installation of any pipe, wire line, conduit, cable or the like shall likewise be issued in the owner's name only. 
(f)  No permit shall be issued without payment of the following: 
Administrative and Engineering Fee 
50 square feet or less excavations $40.00 Over 50 foot excavations 40.00 + X($0.25/sq. ft.) Where "X" is the total square feet above 50 feet Sidewalks only $40.00  
Pavement Degradation Index Fee 
Streets 1 year old or less $1.00/sq. ft. Streets 2 years old or less 0.75/sq. ft. Streets 3 years old or less 0.50/sq. ft. Streets over 3 years old 0.25/sq. ft.  
Note that each administration and engineering fee and the pavement degradation fee shall be assessed for each pavement excavation permit while only the administration and engineering fee will be assessed for sidewalk permits. 
(g)  Every applicant for a sidewalk or roadway opening permit or for the placement of any item or object on, in or under any sidewalk or roadway shall provide appropriate maps and/or sketches in the manner the director may designate, and shall in writing affirm his/her compliance with applicable federal, state and local law, ordinance, rule and regulation. 
(h)  Any appreciable deviation from the plans approved by the director or his designee shall operate to cancel said permit. In the event that such deviation occurs, the director may issue an immediate cease and desist order. The director shall, upon issuance of such order, schedule a hearing, if one is sought by the permittee, within forty-eight (48) hours. Such cease-and-desist order shall be deemed effective when the same is delivered to the "site foreman" or, there being no site foreman, to any individual engaged in the work at the site. The director shall, by telephone or fax, notify the contact person listed as such on permittee's application. Any person who fails to comply immediately with such an order shall be in violation of this Code and if found guilty, shall be punished under section 1-10. 
(i)  Every police officer detailed to an excavation under this chapter shall, upon his/her arrival at such location, ascertain or confirm the existence of a roadway or sidewalk opening permit. In the event no such permit exists, the officer shall notify the department of public works, division of engineering, and shall assist to effect any cease-and-desist order which may issue. 
(j)  Any excavation undertaken in or upon any public highway shall be designed and signed consistent with National Highway Traffic Safety rules and regulations. Each applicant shall, in his/her/its application, designate such precautions and any failure to meet said standards shall operate to terminate any permit. In such event, a hearing substantially similar to that required under subsection (h) shall be provided upon request. 
(k)  No person shall be issued a road or sidewalk opening permit until such time as applicant or his/her/its contractor shall post a performance bond in an amount not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or in such greater or lesser amount as the director may require based upon all relevant circumstances. 
(l)  So-called "keyhole" cutting, while permitted, shall require reconstruction as if the same were a trench cut. 
(m)  No person shall be issued a road or sidewalk opening permit unless he or she or his or her contractor has secured a general liability policy in an amount not less than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00). Such policy shall contain an endorsement extending such coverage to the city, its officers, employees and servants. 
(n)  The director or his/her designee shall review all applications for the installation or laying of any pipe, wire, line, conduit, cable or the like in or under any sidewalk or roadway. The director shall, in the exercise of his judgment, allow or disallow such application. The director's determination shall be based upon a consideration of the totality of the circumstances surrounding such proposal. He or she shall assign significant weight to the fact that such wire, pipe, conduit, etc. is already in place. The director shall confirm that all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws are complied with. He or she shall also especially weigh and seek to ensure that: 
(1)  The public safety is met; 
(2)  Inconvenience to the public is minimized in all reasonable manner; 
(3)  Both the structural integrity or roadways and sidewalks is maximized; and 
(4)  Installations are made in an orderly manner so as to allow the safe and ready maintenance of such installations. 
(o)  Whenever any sidewalk is repaired or replaced, it shall be repaired or replaced with in-kind material. Provided, however, that in the event that no paved sidewalk exists, the director shall specify the "like" material to be used (depending upon the material excavated) and provided further that any sidewalk composed of asphalt, macadam or the like may be replaced by the applicant with cement or concrete. 
(p)  When the public safety convenience and convenience so requires, the department of public works may institute moratoriums of limited duration on road excavation, cold and hot patching, installation of cables, conduit wire, etc. and the issuance of permits of any kind.

Sec. 23-37. - The use of tobacco products in the public way. 
(a)  Purpose . 
(1)  The use of tobacco for smoking purposes is being found to be increasingly dangerous, not only to the person smoking but also to the nonsmoking person who is required to breathe the contaminated air. A pervasive intrusion of the nonsmoker's rights to unpolluted air space is the uncontrolled smoking in downtown Providence. 
(2)  The City of Providence is committed to keeping its downtown clean, safe, healthy and pleasant for everyone. 
a.  Smoking is hazardous to health and numerous studies have shown that secondhand smoke is a significant public health hazard; 
b.  Smoking in public places endangers children and others by exposing them to secondhand smoke; 
c.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a group A carcinogen, the most dangerous class of carcinogen; 
d.  The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that secondhand smoke causes children to suffer from lower respiratory tract illnesses, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, exacerbates childhood asthma and increases the risk of chronic middle ear infection in children; 
e.  Discarding cigarette butts, cigar butts and tobacco waste on sidewalks and streets is unsightly, unclean and particularly hazardous to small children who handle and sometimes ingest them; 
f.  Cigarette butts do not biodegrade and they contain two hundred (200) known poisons, sixty-three (63) of which are known to cause cancer; 
g.  Whereas the area described in subsection (c) of this ordinance includes a public park, a public skating rink, a major bus station, and multiple businesses. 
h.  Whereas the area described in subsection (c) of this ordinance is an area experiencing high pedestrian traffic in a concentrated area. 
i.  Prohibiting smoking and the improper disposal of tobacco products in the area described in subsection (c) of this ordinance is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare of all residents and visitors. The City of Providence intends, by the enactment of this chapter, to protect the health and atmospheric environment of the nonsmoker by regulating smoking in downtown Providence. 
(b)  Definitions . 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, tobacco product means any product containing tobacco or nicotine, including but not limited to cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, bidis, snus, dissolvable tobacco products, and electronic smoking devices; provided, however, that such term shall not include any product that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a tobacco cessation product. 
(2)  Electronic smoking devices means any electronic oral device such as one (1) composed of heating element, battery and/or electronic circuit which provides a vapor of nicotine, vapor of a solution including nicotine, or aerosol of a solution including nicotine or any other substance for inhalation. This term shall include every variation and type of such devices whether they are manufactured, distributed, marketed, or sold as an electronic cigarette, an electronic cigar, an electronic cigarillo, an electronic pen, an electronic pipe or an electronic hookah or any other name or descriptor. The term "electronic smoking device" does not include any device specifically approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in reducing, treating or eliminating nicotine or tobacco dependence, or for any other medical purposes, when such a device is being marketed and sold solely for such approved purpose. 
(c)  [Locations where the use of tobacco is prohibited.] The use of any and all tobacco products is prohibited on all non-enclosed sidewalks and other pedestrian areas, including alleys, accessible to the public anywhere inside the boundary lines contained in paragraph (c) of this section.

(f)  Penalties . For the first offense, the violator will receive a warning. All subsequent offenses are hereby declared to be public nuisances punishable by a civil fine of fifty dollars ($50.00) per violation. Each violation shall be deemed a separate violation, and each violation shall be subject to a separate fine.

As the defendant failed to overcome the prima facie case, established by the plaintiff, by proving that notice in accordance with the provisions of said ordinance (this section) was given to plaintiff before the work in question was performed by said commissioner, the plaintiff's exception to the refusal of the trial court to direct a verdict in her favor must be sustained."

Sec. 231/2-2. - Value of urban trees. 
    Trees are economically beneficial in attracting new industry, residents and visitors. Healthy trees of the right size and species, growing in the right places enhance the value and marketability of property and promote the stability of desirable neighborhoods, thus helping to prevent the emergence of blighted areas and slum conditions. Providence, Rhode Island is situated in an area covered with a variety of trees and shrubs that are a vital part of the heritage passed to us by nature and our forefathers. However, there is much concern over the recent indiscriminate destruction of trees in both public and private places. 
    Trees are recognized as a valued asset, providing a healthier and more beautiful environment in which to live. They provide oxygen, shade, esthetics, and a priceless psychological counterpart to the manmade, urban setting. Trees aid in preventing erosion, siltation of streams and reservoirs, flash flooding, and air, noise, and visual pollution.

(Ord. 1979, ch. 79-37, Art. III, §§ 1-6, 9-28-79) 
Sec. 25-74. - Construction requirements for public sewers and drains. 
(a)  Building sewer or drain connection required. The director is hereby authorized in all cases where there is a public sewer or drain in any street of the city or easement held by the city, to cause every owner of land adjoining such street, or easement, his agent, or tenant to provide, subject to the provisions of this article, a sufficient building sewer or drain from his house, yard or lot, to and into such public sewer or drain, whenever in the opinion of the director the same shall be necessary for the protection of the public health, and shall, thereupon, give such owner, agent or tenant notice in writing, specifying the time within which such building sewer or drain shall be constructed. The director shall prohibit the maintenance of any privy or cesspool on any premises connected with a public sewer or drain. Any person who neglects to construct a building sewer or drain under the provisions of this article within the time specified in such notice to do so, or maintains a privy in violation of such prohibition, shall forfeit and pay a penalty of two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each violation per day. Said penalty may be waived at the discretion of the director and/or city solicitor. 
(b)  Installation of sanitary facilities; connection to public sewer; exceptions. The owner of any house, building or property used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purpose, situated within the city and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located or in the future may be located a public sanitary sewer of the city, is hereby required at his expense to install suitable sanitary facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this article, within ninety (90) days after the date of official notice to do so, provided that said public sewer is determined to be accessible and available by the director and located within one hundred (100) feet to the property line. Extensions greater than ninety (90) days may be granted by the director to individual property owners upon appeal. Said extension shall be granted only when it can be demonstrated that the connection to the public sewer system would create an undue financial hardship upon the owner and an agreement between the owner and the director shall be enacted. Said agreement shall be conditioned on the following: 
(1)  That the waste water from the subject property not be discharged directly or indirectly through groundwater to receiving waters; 
(2)  That the property is served by an acceptable subsurface disposal system, as determined by the director; 
(3)  That the agreement is nontransferable; that is, a new owner must connect up to the sewer system within ninety (90) days of the passing of papers; 
(4)  That the owner agrees to pay the city sewer assessment charge as determined by the city's cost recovery program. 
(c)  Procedure for laying out or constructing new public sewers and drains by the city. Whenever the laying out or construction of a new public sewer or drain by the city is wanted, application therefor shall be made by petition in writing to the mayor or city council signed by not less than six (6) adjacent property owners within six hundred (600) feet of the construction or by the city planning director or by the city engineer. Upon filing of said petition, the mayor or city council may refer the petition to the department of public works for investigation, hearing and report thereon. Before holding any hearing on said petition, the department of public works shall give all parties notice in the same manner as required by the zoning ordinance of the City of Providence. 
    After hearing all interested parties in the same manner as provided in the said zoning ordinance, the department of public works shall report to the mayor or city council whether in the director's opinion, the public convenience or the public health require the laying out of construction of a new public sewer or drain by the city. 
(d)  Preconstruction report, hearing requirements. 
(1)  No new public sewer or drain shall be constructed by the city unless the question of such construction or making shall first be referred to the department of public works, who shall report to the mayor or city council an estimate of its cost, the materials of which and the manner in which the same should be constructed or made, and an estimate of the damage likely to be occasioned by construction, taking land, or encroachment of watercourses; and if the sewer or drain or any portion thereof shall be outside the limits of the streets, it shall not be constructed or made otherwise than by the consent of all persons interested, without the same proceedings being followed as are required for laying out streets. 
(2)  In addition to the aforementioned procedure, the department of public works shall conduct a hearing for all interested parties in accordance with the notification procedure set forth in the said zoning ordinance, after the estimate for damages and estimate of assessments is complete, but before final enactment by the city council. 
(e)  Drawings to be on file. Whenever any public drain or sewer is to be built, the director shall make or cause to be made a plan of the same, showing the form, mode of construction, depth below the surface, relation of the sewer invert elevations to the city base, the alignment and general direction of the drain or sewer relative to the street lines or neighboring property, and the sill elevations of all houses to be served, which plan shall be kept on file in his office. This plan shall be the basis of the elevation and report by the director required under subsection (d) above. 
(f)  Construction requirements-Location, materials. All public sewers which shall be ordered by mayor and city council in any street or highway shall, whenever practical, be laid out in such a way as to not hinder traffic and utilities in such street or highway, and shall be constructed of such materials and of such dimensions as the director shall direct. 
(g)  Same-Other pipes not to interfere. Whenever any street shall be opened for the laying of pipes for water, gas or other purposes, or for the performance of any works of construction or repairs, such laying of pipes and repairs and work connected therewith, or such work of construction shall be executed so as not to obstruct the course, capacity or construction of a public sewer or drain, and whenever pipes for any purpose or any work of construction shall hereafter be found to exist at such depth or in such location as to interfere with any existing sewer or with the building of any public sewer of the required size, and at the proper depth and grades, the person maintaining the same shall, upon notice thereof, at once remove, change and alter such pipes or other works in such manner as the director may direct. If such person neglects to immediately remove, change or alter such pipes in accordance with the terms of notification, then the director may make such removal, change or alteration, and the cost thereof shall be paid by such person. 
(Ord. 1979, ch. 79-37, Art. IV, §§ 1-7, 9-28-79) 
Sec. 25-75. - Use of public sewers. 
(a)  Unpolluted discharges. 
(1)  All users who discharge sanitary waste water to the public sewers shall take all reasonable steps to reduce the volume of their discharge. The director, no later than October 1, 1981, shall prepare a list of devices for existing toilets, water closets, faucets, showerheads and toilet leak detection which can achieve significant flow reduction cost-effectively; and he shall also prepare information about nonstructural methods for reducing such flows. He or his designee shall cause such list and information to be distributed to each user as soon as possible. He shall, subject to the approval of the city council, develop and implement a distribution system for said devices no later than July 1, 1983. 
(2)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted waters such as storm water, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage to any sanitary sewer other than such discharge as is present at the time of passage of this article. All new or altered connections, excluding ordinary repairs, to the sanitary waste water system shall conform with the provisions of this article. 
(3)  Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such drains as are specifically designated as storm drains or combined sewers or to a natural outlet approved by the director. Industrial cooling water of proper temperature and volume or unpolluted process waters may be discharged on approval of the director to a storm drain, combined sewer or natural outlet, only if in the opinion of the director, all reasonable attempts compatible with best practicable technology have been taken to reduce such discharges by the use of recycling and reuse systems for such cooling or unpolluted process waters. However, no materials, the discharge of which into natural streams, ponds, lakes, or other natural bodies of water is prohibited by state or federal law or regulation shall be discharged into any storm drain. 
(b)  Discharge to a natural outlet. The owner of any house, building or property or any industrial, business or commercial establishment situated within the city and presently discharging, either directly or indirectly, to any river, canal, stream, lake or other surface or subsurface watercourse within the city, any industrial waste water, as defined in section 25-72, or any polluted discharges described in subsections (f) and (g) below, within ninety (90) days after the passage and adoption of this article file an application for a permit with the State Department of Environmental Management and the Environmental Protection Agency, and send a copy of the application to the department of public works. The application shall be in conformance with the NPDES requirements. 
(c)  Separate sewer usage-Required. No person shall discharge into or put into any public sewer or drain of the city, or into any sewer, drain or fixture which thereafter discharges into any public sewer, drain or appurtenance thereof, any waste or substance other than such kinds or types of water or water-carried wastes for the conveyance of which the particular sewer, drain or appurtenance is intended, designed and provided. 
(d)  Same-Prohibited uses. Except as specifically provided with reference to some particular sewer, sanitary sewers shall be used for the conveyance and disposal of sanitary waste water, as defined in section 25-72 and for diluted, water-carried industrial sewage which is not objectionable as hereinafter provided. No sanitary sewer shall be used to receive and convey or dispose of any storm or surface water (as defined in section 25-72), subsoil drainage, any large continuous flow of water seeping into buildings or excavations from soils or other underground sources, flows of natural springs or groundwaters, surplus from flowing wells, the discharges from roofs, roof conductors, yard drains, street or highway drains, or of cooling water (as defined in section 25-72). 
(e)  Same-Determination of sewer type. If the original proceedings for the layout and construction of any particular sewer or for its acquisition by the city did not indicate what kind of sewer or drain it was intended to be, or what waste waters could or could not be discharged therein, the director shall consider the pertinent facts and shall determine the kind of sewer or drain said sewer is for the purposes of this article and what waste or waste waters shall be permitted to be discharged thereinto or be excluded therefrom. 
(f)  Polluted discharges-Prohibited. No person(s) shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described pollutants to any public sewers: 
(1)  Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid or gas; 
(2)  Any waters containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any waste treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, create any hazard in the receiving waters of the waste water treatment facility, or exceed the limiting standards issued from time to time under Section 307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. Section 1317(a), as amended to date or hereafter. 
(3)  Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than five and five-tenths (5.5) or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the waste water works. 
(4)  Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the waste water facilities such as, but not limited to, ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails, and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole or ground by garbage grinders. 
(5)  Any septic tank solids or pumpings. 
(6)  In the case of a major contributing industry, as defined herein, any incompatible pollutant, as further defined herein, in an amount or concentration in excess of that allowed under standards or guidelines issued from time to time pursuant to Sections 304, 306 and/or 307, of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C., Sections 1314, 1316, 1317, as amended to date or hereafter. 
(g)  Same-Restricted. The following described substances, materials, water or waste shall be limited in discharges to public sewers to concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, waste water treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving water's physical, chemical or biological components, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. The director may set limitations lower than the limitations established in the regulations below if, in his opinion, such more severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability, the director will give consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the waste water treatment process employed, capacity of the waste water treatment facility, degree of treatability of the waste in the waste water treatment facility, harmful effects on the ecology of the receiving water, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or waste waters discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be violated without approval of the director are as follows: 
(1)  Waste water having a temperature higher than one hundred and four (104) degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).

(7)  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the director in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(8)  Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance which is, in the opinion of the director, capable of creating a public nuisance. 
(9)  Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor producing substances in such concentrations as to exceed the limits established by the director and/or the requirements of the state, federal or other public agencies or jurisdictions for such discharge to the receiving waters. 
(10)  Any wastes having a pH in excess of nine-tenths (0.9). 
(11)  Materials which exert or cause: 
a.  Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, Fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate). 
b.  Color or turbidity in such an amount that it will prevent the city from discharging a treated effluent in compliance with its NPDES permit (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions). 
c.  Unusual BOD concentrations, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine demand in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment facilities and/or may cause the effluent limitations of the city's NPDES permit to be exceeded. 
d.  Quantities of flow, concentrations, or both which constitute a "slug" as defined herein (see section 25-72). 
e.  A potential to contaminate the sludge and contribute to sludge disposal problem. 
(12)  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the waste water treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the waste water treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(13)  Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes in the public sewer system, releases obnoxious gases, form suspended solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes. 
(14)  Any water or waste which by interaction with other water or wastes either directly or indirectly causes the physical, chemical or biological structure of the receiving waters to be adversely affected, causes a health hazard, or disrupts recreational activities on or in the receiving water. 
(h)  Options of director relative to receiving restricted wastes. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (g) above, and which, in the judgment of the director, may have a deleterious effect upon the waste water facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the director may: 
(1)  Reject the wastes, 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers, 
(3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or 
(4)  Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating the waste. 
    If the director permits the pretreatment or equalization waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the director and/or other regulatory agencies. Said review and approval shall include an analysis of whether all practical methods, compatible with the particular processes involved, have been taken to include a water recycling system and/or other flow reduction measures in the pretreatment or equalization system. 
(i)  Excluding polluted discharges from public sewers. In determining whether any waste discharged or proposed to be discharged into any public sewer or drain would have a deleterious effect as described in subsection (h) above, and therefore, should be excluded from the public sewers, consideration shall be given to the quantity, time or times of discharge; rate and manner of discharge; dilution; the biological, chemical and physical composition of the waste water in question; the size of the sewer or drain into which it is or is to be discharged; the probable quantity of other sewage or objectionable wastes in said sewer or drain at the time of discharge; the effects on the receiving waters and other pertinent facts. Minute quantities of a waste which would be objectionable in larger quantity may be permitted upon specific permission of the director if sufficiently diluted when and as discharged, or if the quantity discharged is very small in comparison to the receiving sewer and the flow therein at the time of discharge. Any permission to discharge minute quantities of an otherwise excluded waste shall be revocable at any time by the director. 
(j)  Pretreatment. Where necessary, in the opinion of the director, the owner shall, at his expense, provide such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to reduce such objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in this section, or to control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or waste waters. Plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted to the director for review and approval; and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until said approval is obtained in writing, provided that such agreements do not contravene any requirements of existing federal laws and are compatible with any user charge and industrial cost recovery system in effect. 
(k)  Equipment to prevent prohibited wastes from discharge into public sewer. In all premises where wastes or substances specified to be excluded from sewers or drains by this article are customarily present and liable to be discharged directly or indirectly into any public sewer or drain, suitable and sufficient piping layouts, oil or grease traps or separators, screens, sedimentation chambers, diluting devices, storage and regulating, treatment, cooling or condensing equipment and similar devices or equipment shall be provided, maintained and operated, as required by the director to ensure that no waste, substance or water required to be excluded from said sewer or drain shall be discharged thereinto in violation of the requirements of this article. 
(l)  Accessibility, operation and maintenance of pretreatment facilities-Generally. Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in a condition satisfactory to the director and be effectively operated by the owner at the owner's expense. 
(m)  Same-Grease, oil, sand traps. Grease, oil and sand removal facilities (traps, etc.) shall be provided when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in this section under subsection (g)(3), or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such facilities shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All facilities shall be of a type and capacity approved by the director, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these facilities the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates, and means of disposal which are subject to review by the director. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner(s) must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms. 
(n)  Measuring, sampling and other devices. At premises where any of the substances or wastes prescribed as being or to be excluded for any sewer or drain are present and liable to be discharged contrary to the limitations of this article, the director may require that the owner of said premises provide, operate and maintain a sampling well or wells, a flow measuring device, manholes, catchbasins, or other suitable devices or treatment facilities on any or all building sewers or drains from said premises near the point or points where said sewers connect to any public sewer or drain. By means of said sampling well or wells, or other devices, the owner of said premises and the director or any public officer charged with the duty of supervising the disposal of waste waters may secure samples of or examine the wastes and waste waters discharged into said public sewer and measure the quantities thereof for the purpose of ascertaining the compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of this article. All such devices and facilities shall be installed by the owner at his expense and in accordance with plans approved by the director, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(o)  Description of pretreatment facilities and measuring or sampling devices in building sewer permit. To facilitate compliance with the requirements of this section, the director shall require the owner applying for a permit to install a new connection to any sewer or drain, or to alter or extend an existing building sewer, in any case, where a sampling well, oil or grease trap or separator, diluting device or similar appurtenance is or may be required to furnish the director as part of the application for said permit, a plan or satisfactory description, or both, of the device of whatever kind it is proposed to provide, and a description of the proposed operation thereof. Said plan, description or both shall become part of said application and the installation of the device in accordance therewith shall be a condition attached to the granting of said permit. 
(p)  Analyses of industrial waste waters -Methods. 
(1)  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Waste Water," published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer or private sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
(2)  Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the waste water works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all discharges from the premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken and analyzed. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. 
(q)  Same-Responsibility. Furnishing required analyses, flow date, etc., shall be the responsibility of the applicant. The director will stipulate the minimum analyses and other data that shall be obtained and shall conduct such waste water sampling and measuring programs as are requested by the applicant. Expenses thus incurred by the city shall be assessed to the applicant. 
(r)  Same-Reports. All industries discharging into a public sewer shall perform such monitoring of their discharges as the director and/or other duly authorized employees of the city may reasonably require, including installation, use and maintenance of monitoring [equipment, keeping records and reporting the results of such monitoring] to the director. Such records shall be made available upon request by the director or by other agencies having jurisdiction over discharges to the receiving waters. 
(s)  Treatment of industrial waste waters by city. No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern. Such agreement or arrangement shall first be approved by the director, provided that arrangements do not contravene any requirements of existing federal laws and are compatible with any user charge and industrial cost recovery system in effect. 
(t)  Industrial user permit. 
(1)  Every industrial user shall be required to obtain a permit and shall, within ninety (90) calendar days of the promulgation of these regulations, complete and file at their own expense a permit application form with the director wherein its discharge is located. All industrial users are required to apply for a permit. The director shall evaluate the adequacy of data furnished in the application form. If insufficient data has been furnished, the director will notify the industrial user to provide additional data within a specified time. After acceptance of data, the director will issue the permit. The director may stipulate special conditions and terms upon which the permit may be issued. 
(2)  Each industrial permittee shall submit a duly signed semiannual discharge report to the director. The director shall establish guidelines which will specify the content of the discharge report. 
(3)  The director will evaluate the data furnished. If insufficient data has been furnished, additional information may be required. 
(4)  Each industrial user shall monitor and analyze for the necessary parameters according to its standard industrial classification (SIC) as established by the director. SIC designation and parameters to be monitored and analyzed shall conform to approved EPA pretreatment standards and/or guidelines established by the director.

(b)  Authority to gather data. The director or other duly authorized employees are authorized to obtain information concerning industrial processes which have a direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the waste water collection system.

(b)  Liabilities. Any person violating any of the provisions of the article shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the city by reason of such violation, so that if the director shall have caused the disconnection of a building sewer or drain from the public sewerage system, the director may collect the cost of making such disconnection from any person responsible for or willfully concerned in or who profited by such violation of the requirements of this article and may thereafter refuse to permit the restoration of the former connection or of any new connection to the property concerned in the violation of this article until the claim of the city for the cost of making such disconnection shall have been paid in full, plus interest, and the reasonable cost of any legal expenses incurred by the city in connection therewith. 
(c)  Penalties. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit provided for in subsection (a) above shall be assessed a fine in an amount not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00). Each day in which such violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate violation for the purpose of applying the above assessments. In addition, the director may direct the person to disconnect or otherwise act to prevent the building sewer, from the premises in which said violation of the requirements of this article shall have occurred, from discharging to the public sewerage system. 
(d)  Inspection of work in violation of article. If any person shall construct, install, alter or repair any sewer or connection to any interceptor in violation of the requirements of these rules and regulations, the director may, in his discretion, order or direct such person to uncover and fully expose any or all portions of such sewer or connection and afford the director and his representatives adequate opportunity for examination and inspection of the work. If the sewer or connection and appurtenances thereof shall be found not to be in full accord with the requirements of these rules and regulations and the standards established under its provisions, then the director may serve the violator with written notice as provided in subsection (a) above.

Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be approved by him before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
(1)  If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable to comply with any prohibition or limitations in this article, the facility responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the director so that corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a written report addressed to the director detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges shall be filed by the responsible industrial facility within five (5) days of the occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.

(3)  In order that employees of users may be informed of city requirements, users shall make available to their employees copies of this article, together with such other waste water information and notices which may be furnished by the city, from time to time, directed toward more effective water pollution control. A notice shall be furnished and permanently posted on the user's bulletin board advising employees whom to call in case of an accidental discharge in violation of this article. 
(4)  Any direct or indirect connection or entry point for persistent or deleterious wastes to the user's plumbing or drainage system should be eliminated.

    When the city finds that a discharge of waste water has taken place, in violation of prohibitions or limitations of this article, or the provisions of a waste water discharge permit, the director may issue an order to cease and desist, and direct that those persons not complying with such prohibitions, limits, requirements or provisions to: 
(1)  Comply forthwith;

    Any user, permit applicant or permit holder affected by any decision, action or determination, including cease-and-desist orders, made by the director, interpreting or implementing the provisions of this article or in any permit issued herein, may file with the director a written request for reconsideration within ten (10) days of such decision, action or determination, setting forth in detail the facts supporting the user's request for reconsideration. 
    If the ruling made by the director is unsatisfactory to the person requesting reconsideration, he may within ten (10) days after notification of the action, file a written appeal to the city council. The written appeal shall be heard by the city council within thirty (30) days from the date of filing. The city council shall make a final ruling on the appeal within fifteen (15) days of the close of the meeting. The director's decision, action, or determination shall remain in effect during such period of reconsideration.

But I desire the said City of Providence cause to be placed somewhere on or about said Homestead or grounds a bronze tablet reading substantially as follows:

B. Building Height
1. For a vacant parcel of land, building height shall be measured from the average, existing-grade elevation where the foundation of the structure is proposed. This method of building height applies to all structures unless specifically exempted by this Ordinance. For an existing structure, building height shall be measured from average grade taken from the outermost four (4) corners of the existing foundation. In all cases, building height shall be measured to the top of the highest point of the existing or proposed roof or structure. This distance shall exclude spires, chimneys, flag poles, and the like, as described in item 2 below. (Figure 2-4). For any property or structure located in a special flood hazard area, as shown on the official FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), building height shall be measured from base flood elevation, and where freeboard, as defined in Section 201, is being utilized or proposed, such freeboard area, not to exceed five feet, shall be excluded from the building height calculation; provided, however, that the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council design elevation maps may be used by an owner or applicant to establish a base flood elevation for a property that is higher than the official FEMA FIRMs.
2. The following structures or parts thereof are exempt from maximum height limitations, unless otherwise limited by any height restriction imposed by any airport authority, port authority, or other similar federal, state, or local authority.
a. Public utility poles, towers, and wires. This does not include wireless telecommunication towers and wind turbines that are regulated separately by this Ordinance.

However, building appurtenances shall be eligible for this exemption only if they meet the following standards:
i. The footprint of all building appurtenances shall not exceed 50% of the total floor area of the roof.
ii. All mechanical appurtenances or penthouses to house mechanical appurtenances roof equipment shall be set back from the edge of the roof a minimum distance of one foot for every two feet by which the equipment extends above the roof.
iii. The Downtown Design Review Committee may waive these regulations pertaining to rooftop mechanical equipment in the D-1 District to permit up to 100% of the roof to be covered by such structures.

E. Gross Floor Area (GFA)
The sum of the gross horizontal area of the floors of a building measured from the exterior face of exterior walls or from the centerline of walls separating two buildings, but not including interior parking spaces, loading spaces for motor vehicles, or any space where the floor to ceiling height is less than six feet.
F. Impervious Surface Coverage
Impervious surface coverage is a measure of intensity of land use that represents the portion of a site that is occupied by structures, pavement, and other impervious surfaces that do not allow for the absorption of water into the ground. Regardless of the surface treatment, all areas designated or used for parking or access to parking shall be considered impervious surfaces.
1. Maximum impervious surface of a lot is calculated as the percentage of all impervious surface area of the total area of the lot.
2. Maximum impervious surface of a specific yard is calculated as the percentage of all impervious surface area of the total yard area. Yard area is defined in item O below.
G. Lighting
1. Luminaire Height
The total height of a luminaire is measured to the top of the pole or luminaire, whichever is higher, from grade. (Figure 2-6)

Zoning Ordinance Article 2. Definitions and Rules of Measurement
2. Footcandle
A footcandle (FC) is a unit of illumination produced on a surface, all points of which are one foot from a uniform point source of one standard candle. Footcandle is measured utilizing a direct reading, portable light meter mounted in a horizontal position.
H. Lot
A lot is the basic development unit for determination of lot area, depth, and other dimensional regulations; or a parcel of land whose boundaries have been established by some legal instrument such as a recorded deed or recorded map and which is recognized as a separate legal entity for purposes of transfer of title. The following describes the types of lot configurations: (Figure 2-7)
1. An interior lot is a lot other than a corner or through lot, bounded by two interior side lot lines.
2. A corner lot is a lot situated at the junction of, and abutting on, two or more intersecting streets.
3. A through lot is a lot which fronts upon two parallel streets, or which fronts upon two streets which do not intersect at the boundaries of the lot.

Zoning Ordinance Article 2. Definitions and Rules of Measurement
I. Lot Area
The total area within the boundaries of a lot, excluding any street right-of-way, usually reported in acres or square feet. (Figure 2-8)
J. Lot Building Coverage
That portion of the lot that is or may be covered by buildings, accessory buildings, and other structures covered by a roof.
K. Lot Depth
The distance measured from the front lot line to the rear lot line. For lots where the front and rear lot lines are not parallel, the lot depth is an average of the depth. (Figure 2-8)
L. Lot Line
A line of record, bounding a lot, which divides one lot from another lot or from a public or private street or any other public or private space and includes: (Figure 2-9)
1. A front lot line is the lot line separating a lot from a street right-of-way. The front lot line of a corner lot may be any one of the lot lines abutting a street. A front lot line for a through lot is both lot lines that abut a street.
2. A rear lot line is the lot line opposite and most distant from the front lot line, or in the case of triangular or otherwise irregularly shaped lots, an assumed line at least ten feet in length entirely within the lot, parallel to and at a maximum distance from the front lot line.
3. An interior side lot line is a lot line that is perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to the front lot line and abuts another lot.
4. A corner side lot line is a lot line that is perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to the front lot line.
5. A street lot line is a lot line that abuts a street.
M. Lot Width
Lot width is the horizontal distance between the side lot lines measured at right angles to its depth along a straight line parallel to the front lot line at the minimum front setback line. (Figure 2-8)

N. Sign Dimension Measurement
1. Measurement of Sign Area
Sign area is measured as follows: (Figure 2-10)
a. For signs on a background, the entire area of the background is calculated as sign area, including any material or color forming the sign face and the background used to differentiate the sign from the structure against which it is mounted. Sign area does not include any supports or bracing.
b. For signs consisting of freestanding letters or logos, the sign area is calculated as the total area of each square, circle, rectangle, or triangle, or combination thereof, which encompasses each individual letter or logo. Sign area does not include any supports or bracing.
c. Window signs printed on a transparent film and affixed to the interior or exterior of a windowpane are calculated as individual letters or logos, provided that the portion of the transparent film around the perimeter of the individual letters or logos maintains 100% transparency of the window.
d. The sign area of a three-dimensional, free-form, or sculptural (non-planar) sign is calculated as 50% of the sum of the area of the four vertical sides of the smallest cube that will encompass the sign.
City of Providence 2-23
Zoning Ordinance Article 2. Definitions and Rules of Measurement
FIGURE 2-10
2. Measurement of Sign Height

O. Yards and Setbacks
A yard is the open space area between the building line of a principal building and the adjoining lot lines. A required setback is the required minimum distance a principal building shall be located from a lot line, which is unoccupied and unobstructed by any portion of a principal building or accessory structure, unless permitted by this Ordinance, and may be equal to or lesser than a yard. A setback is located along a lot line for the minimum depth specified by the zoning district in which such lot is located. A build-to zone or build-to line is considered a required setback. (Figure 2-12)
1. Front Yard and Front Setback
A front yard is located between a principal building line and the front lot line. A front setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building shall be located from the front lot line. The front yard and front setback extend the full width of the lot between side lot lines measured perpendicular to the front lot line.
2. Interior Side Yard and Interior Side Setback
An interior side yard is located between a principal building line and the interior side lot line. An interior side setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building shall be located from the interior side lot line. The interior side yard and interior side setback extend along the interior side lot line between the front and rear yard and setback, measured perpendicular to the interior side lot line. For rowhouse developments, the interior side yard and interior side setback are applicable to end units only. For semi-detached dwellings, the interior side yard and interior side yard setback do not apply to the lot line where the party wall is located.
3. Corner Side Yard and Corner Side Setback
A corner side yard is located between a principal building line and the corner side lot line. A corner side setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building shall be located from the corner side lot line. The corner side yard and corner side setback extend along the corner side lot line between the front yard or front setback and the rear lot line, measured perpendicular to the corner side lot line.
4. Rear Yard and Rear Setback
A rear yard is located between a principal building line and the rear lot line. A rear setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building shall be located from the rear lot line. The rear yard and rear setback extend between interior side lot lines, measured perpendicular to the rear lot line. In the case of a corner lot, the rear yard and rear setback extend between the interior side lot line to the required corner side setback for the lot, measured perpendicular to the rear lot line.

301 ZONING MAP
A. Maintenance of Zoning Map
The City Clerk is the custodian of the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map. The Department of Planning and Development is responsible for updating the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map when it is amended by the City Council and shall provide such amended text and maps to the City Clerk.
B. Location of Districts
1. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance are set forth in the Official Zoning Map, as periodically amended. The Official Zoning Map is incorporated into, and made an integral part of, this Ordinance.
2. It is the intent of this Ordinance that the entire area of the City, including all land and water areas, are included in the zoning districts established by this Ordinance. Any land lying within the City, but not shown on the Official Zoning Map as being included within a district, is classified as the R-1 District.
C. Interpretation of Boundary Lines
1. Right-of-Way Lines
Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with streets, highways, expressways, easements, railroads, or waterways (rivers, lakes, streams, or other bodies of water), the boundary line is construed to be the centerline of the right-of-way.
2. Property Lines
Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with a recorded property line, the property line is construed to be the boundary line of the district.
3. Scaled Lines
Where the district boundary lines do not coincide with a right-of-way line or recorded property line, the district boundary is determined by measuring such boundary line(s) by using the map scale as provided on the Zoning Map.
4. Clarification of Boundary Lines
The Zoning Board of Review decides any interpretations of zoning district boundary lines, where there is doubt as to the boundary between two zoning districts.
302 EXEMPTIONS FOR PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND PUBLIC UTILITIES
A. The provisions of this Ordinance do not apply to land located within public rights-of-way, except for encroachments into the public right-of-way authorized under this Ordinance.
B. The following utility uses are exempt from the provisions of this Ordinance and permitted in any district: wires, cables, conduits, vaults, laterals, pipes, mains, hydrants, valves and water supply wells. Electric substations are exempt from the demolition provisions of Article 6.
C. This exemption does not include utilities, power plants, solar energy systems (principal use), wind energy systems (principal use), or wireless telecommunications, as defined in Article 12, or amateur (HAM) radio equipment, solar energy systems (accessory use), or wind energy systems (accessory use). All such structures shall comply with this Ordinance and any other applicable City ordinances.

400 PURPOSE STATEMENTS
A. R-1A Residential District
The R-1A Residential District is intended for neighborhoods of lower density residential development. The R-1A District accommodates single-family dwellings on larger lots than those typically found in the City. Limited non-residential uses, which are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be allowed.
B. R-1 Residential District
The R-1 Residential District is intended for detached single-family dwellings of low density residential development. Limited non-residential uses, which are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be allowed.
C. R-2 Residential District
The R-2 Residential District is intended for areas of detached single-family and two-family, including semi-detached, residential development of moderate density. Limited non-residential uses, which are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be allowed.
D. R-3 Residential District
The R-3 Residential District is intended for higher density residential areas of detached single-family, two-family, and three-family residential development, as well as rowhouse development. Limited non-residential uses, which are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be allowed.
E. R-4 Residential District
The R-4 Residential District accommodates a variety of residential structures: single-family, two-family and semi-detached, three-family, rowhouses, and multi-family housing. The R-4 District accommodates higher density residential development in areas that minimize negative impacts to lower density residential neighborhoods. Limited non-residential uses, which are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be allowed.
F. RP Residential Professional District
The RP Residential Professional District is intended to preserve and enhance the residential integrity of select heavily traveled streets where certain residential-professional and low-intensity commercial uses are compatible. Compatible non-residential uses are those that can be accommodated within an existing residential structure to preserve the character of the street and its architecturally attractive and distinctive qualities.
401 USES
Article 12 lists permitted and special principal uses and temporary uses for the residential districts.
City of Providence 42
Zoning Ordinance Article 4. Residential Districts
402 DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
A. General Standards
Table 4-1: Residential District Dimensional Standards establishes the dimensional standards for the residential districts. These regulations apply to all uses within each district unless a different standard is listed for a specific use.
B. Front Setback Calculation
The front setback requirement in residential districts is a required build-to zone calculated according to an averaging provision, as follows:
1. The build-to zone is calculated as the average of the front setbacks of developed lots within 100 feet on either side of the subject lot on the same side of the street as the subject lot. Any lots within this distance that are only partially within this 100 feet are also included in the calculation. The resulting calculation can be increased or decreased by five feet to establish the build-to zone.
2. If there are no buildings on the same side of the street, developed lots within 100 feet in both directions on the opposite side of the street are used for averaging to calculate the required minimum front setback. Any lots within this distance that are only partially within this 100 feet are also included in the calculation. The resulting calculation can be increased or decreased by five feet to establish the build-to zone.
3. If there are no buildings on the same side or the opposite side of the street, the required front build-to zone is set as the area between 5% and 15% of the lot depth.
C. Interior Side Setback Applicability
1. For semi-detached dwellings, interior side yards are required only along the interior side lot line where the party wall between dwellings is not located
2. For rowhouse dwellings, interior side yards are required only for end units.
D. Existing Lots
Where a standard is indicated as applicable to existing lots, the standard is applicable to lots recorded prior to the effective date of this Ordinance. Where a standard is indicated as applicable to new subdivisions, the standard is applicable to new lots created by subdivision as of or after the effective date of this Ordinance.
E. RP District Conversions
The conversion of an existing residential structure to a non-residential use in the RP District shall comply with the dimensional standards for the original type of residential structure. Structures originally constructed as or new structures constructed for non-residential uses are subject to the standards for non-residential uses.
F. RP District Design Requirements
When new and existing structures are to be used for non-residential purposes, the principal structure shall be residential in character. The structure shall meet, to the extent possible, the design standards for the dwelling type. The structure and any non-residential use within shall maintain a residential appearance from the exterior, and the site shall be designed consistent with residential uses in the surrounding neighborhood including similar landscaping and minimal paving for parking and driveways.

Height bonuses are intended to give property owners incentives to provide additional community amenities, such as passive and active recreational open space, active ground floor land uses, mixed-use development, and transportation infrastructure, in conjunction with the proposed development.
2. For proposed developments within the ES Overlay District, the Design Review Committee is authorized to grant height bonuses of up to two stories above the maximum building height of the underlying zoning district if one or more of the following are provided as part of the proposed project.
a. Provision of 50% or more of off-street parking in a parking structure in conformance to the provisions set forth in this Section.
b. Provision of on-site, publicly-accessible open space for passive and/or active recreation within the ES Overlay District totaling a minimum of 10% of the lot area, with the condition that the open space is available for use every day, year-round, during daylight hours, and maintained by the property owner.
c. Provision of a minimum of 5,000 square feet of active ground floor uses fronting South Main Street, South Water Street, or Wickenden Street including but not limited to restaurants and cafes, sales and service retail, professional office space, art galleries, performance space, and community event space.
d. Provision of vertical mixed-use development, of which at least 50% is devoted to residential use.

1301 EXTERIOR LIGHTING
A. Purpose
Exterior lighting is used to illuminate uses, parking lots, signs, and other site elements on a property. When well designed and properly installed, exterior lighting improves visibility and safety, provides a sense of security, and complements the character of the City. Conversely, poorly designed and improperly installed lighting can be inefficient, cause glare, and create light trespass and sky glow. In order to ensure that exterior lighting is well designed, and impacts on adjacent properties are controlled, the following requirements control exterior lighting in the Citys zoning districts.
B. Lighting Plan Required
1. A lighting plan is required for all non-residential uses and multi-family and rowhouse dwellings. Single-family, semi-detached, two-family, and three-family dwellings are exempt from a required lighting plan but are subject to applicable lighting requirements.

This also applies to a simultaneous change in use of a group of uses on the same lot which together result in a need for an increase in vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of 10% or more. The percent increase is calculated by dividing the number of additional spaces required by the number of spaces required before the increase.
2. A change in use is eligible for a parking exemption per Section 1410.
3. A change in use is eligible for shared parking per Section 1411.
C. Change in Intensity of Use
Whenever the intensity of a use is increased based on an increase in the number of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement used to calculate the number of required number of vehicle and bicycle parking spaces, additional spaces shall be provided for that increase, except as described below:
1. Whenever there is an increase in the intensity of a use that creates a need for additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of 10% or more, the additional spaces are required. No additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces are required if the increase in intensity would result in an increase of spaces of less than 10%. This also applies to a simultaneous increase in intensity of a group of uses on the same lot which together result in a need for an increase in vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of 10% or more. The percent increase is calculated by dividing the number of additional spaces required by the number of spaces required before the increase.
City of Providence 14 - 2
Zoning Ordinance Article 14. Off-Street Parking and Loading
2. An increase in the intensity of a use is eligible for a parking exemption per Section 1410.
3. An increase in the intensity of a use is eligible for shared parking per Section 1411.
D. Grandfathered Deficiency of Required Vehicle and Bicycle Parking
1. In order to encourage the reuse of existing structures, this Ordinance allows for the grandfathered deficiency of vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of the immediate previous use. A property owner is required to show documentation of the grandfathered vehicle and bicycle spaces.
2. For illustrative purposes, the following example is provided. If the immediate previous use required ten vehicle parking spaces but was only able to provide four vehicle spaces, the six vehicle spaces that the use was unable to provide are grandfathered with the site. When a new use is undertaken in the structure that requires 12 vehicle spaces, it will be deficient eight vehicle spaces, as four are already constructed on the site. The six deficient vehicle spaces from the previous use are then applied to this eight vehicle space deficiency, meaning that the new user shall provide two more vehicle parking spaces or apply for a variance if unable to provide the additional vehicle spaces. See calculation below for further illustration of this example:
SAMPLE CALCULATION OF GRANDFATHERED PARKING PROVISION
STEP 1
IMMEDIATE PREVIOUS USE: Required Parking
10 spaces
Subtract
IMMEDIATE PREVIOUS USE: Actual Parking
4 spaces
GRANDFATHERED
6 spaces
STEP 2
NEW USE: Required Parking
12 spaces
Subtract
NEW USE: Actual Parking
4 spaces
NEW USE: Parking Deficiency
8 spaces
STEP 3
NEW USE: Parking Deficiency
8 spaces
Subtract
GRANDFATHERED
6 spaces
NEW USE: Additional Required Spaces
2 space
3. Following complete demolition of a structure, the new construction and use on the site shall meet all parking requirements and the grandfathered deficiency provision is no longer applicable.
E. Provision of Additional Spaces
Nothing in this Article prevents the voluntary establishment of additional off-street vehicle and bicycle parking spaces above that required by this Ordinance, unless the Ordinance specifies a maximum number of vehicle spaces in Section 1402.B. There is no limit on the number of bicycle parking spaces that may be provided.
F. Prohibition on Use of Parking Facilities
The sale, repair, or dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials, or supplies, or the display of goods in off-street parking areas is prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by this Ordinance.
1401 COMPUTATION OF REQUIREMENTS
This section describes how the number of vehicle, bicycle, and loading spaces are calculated based upon the requirements of this Article. The total number of required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces is based upon the requirements for the principal use or uses located on the lot.
A. Where multiple uses with different parking requirements occupy the same structure or lot, the required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces is the sum of the requirements for each use computed separately, unless otherwise permitted by this Ordinance.
City of Providence 14 - 3
Zoning Ordinance Article 14. Off-Street Parking and Loading
B. Space allocated to any off-street loading space shall not be used to satisfy the requirement for any off-street vehicle or bicycle parking space or access aisle or portion thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any off-street vehicle or bicycle parking space shall not be used to satisfy the replacement for any off-street loading space or portion thereof.
C. A fraction of less than one-half is disregarded, and a fraction of one-half or more is counted as one parking or loading space.
D. For uses where patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or open floor areas used for service, each 48 linear inches of benches, pews, or permanent seating areas, or five square feet of open floor areas used for seating is counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for the required number of spaces.
1402 REQUIRED OFF-STREET VEHICLE AND BICYCLE PARKING SPACES
A. General Requirements
1. Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, the minimum number of off-street vehicle and bicycle parking spaces to be provided for each use is listed in Table 14-1: Off-Street Vehicle and Bicycle Parking Requirements. Construction of all off-street parking shall be completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
2. Table 14-1 lists parking requirements for each use. In some cases, uses that are considered part of a generic use category are listed with specific vehicle parking requirements. These specific uses are listed only for the purposes of this section and do not indicate whether such uses are permitted or special uses within any district. Certain uses listed within the districts are not listed in Table 14-1 and therefore do not have vehicle parking requirements.
3. Certain uses listed within Table 14-1 are required to provide bicycle parking spaces. Of those uses required to provide bicycle spaces, some are also required to provide long-term spaces, where bicycles will be left for longer periods of time and require a safe and weatherproof storage area. The required number of long-term spaces is shown as a percentage of the required total bicycle spaces. All other required bicycle spaces shall be designed as short-term spaces, which are areas where bicycles will be left for short stops, requiring a high degree of convenience.
4. In all cases where bicycle parking is required, a minimum of two bicycle spaces shall be provided. After the first 25 required bicycle parking spaces are provided, additional bicycle parking spaces are required at a 50% reduction.
5. Where bicycle parking space requirements indicate Over 10,000sf GFA or other number threshold, this means that bicycle spaces are required only for structures over a certain gross floor area. In these cases, bicycle parking space requirements are calculated on the basis of the entire gross floor area.
6. Specific parking requirements may apply to the TOD Overlay District in Section 1106.
B. Maximum Vehicle Parking Limitations
The following vehicle parking maximums are applicable to all surface parking lots:
1. When surface parking lots are constructed for any commercial or office use over 20,000 square feet in gross floor area or any multi-tenant retail center or office park, the total number of vehicle parking spaces provided shall not exceed 135% of the required minimum. This vehicle parking maximum does not apply to vehicle parking spaces provided within a parking structure.
2. If a use is exempt from parking minimums, the maximum limitations of this section still apply if parking is voluntarily provided.
City of Providence 14 - 4
Zoning Ordinance Article 14. Off-Street Parking and Loading
C. Vehicle Space Reduction for Provision of Bicycle Spaces
The following reductions in the number of vehicle parking spaces are permitted when bicycle parking and facilities are provided. An applicant may only use one of these three options.
1. A non-residential use may use up to two required vehicle parking spaces as space for bicycle parking. The area of the vehicle parking spaces shall be used for bicycle parking.
2. Where a non-residential use provides shower and locker facilities for use by bicyclists, a reduction of four vehicle parking spaces is permitted.
3. Where a non-residential use provides additional bicycle parking spaces of 120% or more of that required, the non-residential use is permitted a vehicle parking space reduction of up to 10%.
D. Provision of Car- and Bike-Share Facilities
1. Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated parking spaces for car-share facilities. A car-share facility is a membership-based car-sharing service that provides automobile rental to members, billable by the hour or day; it is not considered a vehicle rental establishment. Spaces reserved for car-share facilities may count toward minimum parking requirements of this Ordinance.
2. Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated areas for bike-share facilities. A bike-share facility provides bicycle rentals to the public and it is not considered a vehicle rental establishment. When a minimum of 10 bicycles are provided by a bike-share facility, such facilities qualify for 5% of required vehicle spaces.
E. Provision of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated parking spaces for electric vehicle charging. Spaces reserved for electric vehicle charging count toward minimum parking requirements of this Ordinance.
F. Multi-Tenant Retail Center Parking Calculation
Parking for multi-tenant retail centers is calculated as one space required per 500 square feet of gross floor area, rather than by the individual uses. A multi-tenant retail center is defined as a group of two or more commercial establishments, primarily retail, but also including personal service, restaurant, office, and similar non-residential establishments, that is planned, owned, and/or managed as a single property. The two main configurations of multi-tenant retail centers are large shopping centers and strip centers. In addition, one bicycle space is required per 5,000 square feet of gross floor area with 25% of those required spaces designed as long-term bicycle parking.

Zoning Ordinance Article 14. Off-Street Parking and Loading
1403 REQUIRED OFF-STREET LOADING SPACES
A. Off-street loading spaces shall be provided for any use that distributes or receives materials or merchandise by trucks or other commercial vehicles in accordance with Table 14-2: Off-Street Loading Requirements. In the case of multi-tenant developments, required loading spaces are calculated on the basis of each individual tenant. For example, if only one commercial tenant of a multi-tenant development is over 20,000 square feet, only one loading space is required; if all tenants are under 20,000 square feet, no loading is required.
B. Structures that are 50 years of age or older and do not currently have any loading areas are exempt from off-street loading requirements.
C. If a use increases the floor area by 30% or more, accessory off-street loading spaces are required in accordance with Table 14-2.
D. No structure is required to provide more than five loading spaces.

1404 DESIGN OF VEHICLE PARKING SPACES
A. Permitted Vehicle Parking Locations
1. Residential Uses
a. All required off-street vehicle parking spaces for residential uses and the residential component of mixed-use developments shall be located on the same lot or on a separate lot from the lot containing the use for which parking is required, if the Director of Inspection and Standards finds that the proposed location is within a reasonable distance of the use, the off- site parking conforms to this Ordinance, and the off-site parking is not required for another use. Shared parking in accordance with Section 1411 is permitted. When parking is not located on the same lot, the property owner(s) shall be required to execute and file a lien with the Recorder of Deeds against both the lot containing the requiring parking and the lot for which the parking is being provided. The lien, which must also be signed by the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards, shall designate the use of the lot for off-street parking, and provide notice that insufficient parking exists on the original lot. The lien may be terminated by the parties, with the consent of the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards, only if it is no longer necessary for conformance.
b. For single-family, two-family, semi-detached, three-family, and rowhouse dwellings, required vehicle parking spaces are permitted in private driveways, but shall not encroach onto the public right-of-way.
c. Tandem vehicle parking is permitted for residential uses.
City of Providence 14 - 9
Zoning Ordinance Article 14. Off-Street Parking and Loading
d. For single-family, two-family, semi-detached, and three-family dwellings where there is alley access, all vehicle parking areas shall be accessed from the alley and all vehicle parking areas shall be located in the rear yard.
2. Non-Residential Uses
a. Vehicle parking for a non-residential use shall be located on the same lot or on a separate lot from the lot containing the use for which parking is required, if the Director of Inspection and Standards finds that the proposed location is within a reasonable distance of the use, the off- site parking conforms to this Ordinance, and the off-site parking is not required for another use. Valet parking services shall provide evidence of a lot reserved for vehicle parking. Shared parking in accordance with Section 1411 is permitted. When parking is not located on the same site, the property owner(s) shall be required to execute and file a lien with the Recorder of Deeds against both the lot containing the requiring parking and the lot for which the parking is being provided. The lien, which must also be signed by the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards, shall designate the use of the lot for off-street parking, and provide notice that insufficient parking exists on the original lot. The lien may be terminated by the parties, with the consent of the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards, only if it is no longer necessary for conformance.
b. Tandem vehicle parking is permitted for non-residential uses. If such tandem spaces are unattended (i.e., an attendant moves the vehicles), a management plan is required.
c. For educational facilities  university or college and healthcare institutions, required parking is fulfilled by all parking areas on the campus, including non-contiguous areas, as detailed in an institutional master plan.
B. Dimensions of Vehicle Parking Spaces
1. Off-street vehicle parking spaces shall be designed in accordance with Figure 14-1.
2. Parking facilities consisting of ten or more spaces may set aside up to 10% of the required spaces as compact car spaces.
C. Access Requirements for Off-Street Vehicle Parking Areas
1. Each off-street vehicle space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of adequate width to provide access to a vehicle parking space. All off-street parking facilities shall provide access in a manner that least interferes with traffic movement. For all uses except single-family, two-family, semi-detached, and three-family dwellings, the parking area shall be designed so that the driver of the vehicle proceeds forward into traffic rather than backs out.
2. All required off-street parking facilities shall have vehicular access from a street, alley, driveway, or cross-access connection.
D. Accessible Vehicle Parking Requirements
All parking lots shall comply with the regulations issued by federal agencies under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) for the amount and design of accessible vehicle parking spaces required in parking lots and structures.
E. Hydraulic Lifts
All hydraulic lifts shall be located within a parking structure.

F. Striping
Off-street parking areas of more than four spaces shall be marked by painted lines maintained in clearly visible condition, curbs or other means to indicate individual spaces. Signs or markers should be used as necessary to ensure efficient and safe circulation within the lot. Vehicle parking spaces for handicapped persons shall be identified with the appropriate sign and visible at all times of the year, regardless of plant growth or similar conditions.
G. Curbing and Wheel Stops
Wheel stops or curbing shall be provided to prevent vehicles from damaging or encroaching upon any adjacent parking or loading space, sidewalk, landscaped area, or parking lot island, fence, wall, or building.

Temporary storage tents for recreational vehicles are prohibited.
D. No recreational vehicle may be used for living, sleeping, or housekeeping purposes in any district and may not be hooked up to any public utilities.
E. All recreational vehicles shall be maintained in mobile condition. No recreational vehicle may be parked or stored in such manner as to create a dangerous or unsafe condition on the lot where it is parked or stored. If the recreational vehicle is parked or stored, whether loaded or not, so that it may tip or roll, it is considered to be a dangerous and unsafe condition.
1410 PARKING EXEMPTIONS
A. Applicability
When a use is exempt from vehicle parking requirements by this Article, bicycle parking is required unless bicycle parking is specifically exempted as well. If a use that is exempt from vehicle parking voluntarily provides parking, bicycle parking, as required by this Article, is required.
B. Exemptions from Parking Requirements
1. The D-1 District is exempt from all off-street vehicle and bicycle parking requirements.
2. Specific parking exemptions may apply to the TOD Overlay District in Section 1106.

City of Providence 14 - 17
Zoning Ordinance Article 14. Off-Street Parking and Loading
7. In the C-1 and C-2 districts, all lots of 10,000 square feet or less are exempt from parking requirements.
8. Existing structures as of the effective date of this Ordinance that currently do not provide any parking due to lack of sufficient space on the lot to accommodate parking are exempt from all off-street vehicle and bicycle parking requirements regardless of any change in intensity or use, subject to review and approval by the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards. The Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards may require the property owner to provide evidence that the structure has not historically provided parking. Once the principal building is demolished, this exemption is not longer valid. In addition, if the lot area is expanded (e.g., the adjoining lot is purchased), this exemption is not longer valid.
C. Exemption for Approved Parking Management Plan
1. For health care institutions and educational facilities - universities and colleges, exemptions to required off-street parking requirements may be granted based on submittal and approval of a parking management plan, which is approved by the City Plan Commission. Exemptions may be granted for the implementation and demonstrated effectiveness of parking and transportation alternatives that provide students, employees, and/or visitors with mobility options designed to reduce demand for parking and relieve congestion on adjacent streets.
2. When a healthcare institution or university of college educational facility has a noncontiguous campus, parking may be supplied on one part of the campus to meet the parking needs of the other noncontiguous part of the campus provided that a shuttle service is supplied by the institution to move students and staff between the non-contiguous campuses. This provision is applicable only if an institutional master plan, which includes a parking/shuttle plan, has been submitted and approved in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
3. Reductions in parking requirements will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with a potential reduction of up to 30% when it is clear that the parking and transportation alternative(s) will result in a corresponding reduction in parking demand. This reduction does not include any grandfathered shortfall.
4. A campus-wide parking management plan shall be submitted as part of the Institutional Master Plan, and shall include the following information:
a. The number, size, location, access, and general operation and management of all required and proposed on-site and off-site parking and loading spaces.
b. Traffic demand management strategies including, but not limited to:
i. Available public transportation options.
ii. Existing and proposed shuttle services.
iii. Bicycle parking.
iv. Facility design, operation, shared vehicle, and/or parking strategies.
v. Enforcement and controls.
vi. Overflow management strategies.
c. A parking and trip demand analysis prepared by a certified traffic engineer.
1411 SHARED PARKING
A. Off-street parking spaces for separate uses may be provided collectively if the aggregate number of spaces provided is not less than the sum of the spaces required in Table 14-3: Shared Parking Calculation. Multi-tenant retail centers are not eligible for shared parking. Mixed-use developments,
City of Providence 14 - 18
Zoning Ordinance Article 14. Off-Street Parking and Loading
multi-use office parks, and similar types of development, and property owners that establish cross-access easements are all eligible for shared parking.
B. Table 14-3 is applied in the following manner:
1. The required number of spaces for each use is calculated according to Table 14-1.
2. The required number of spaces for each use is then applied to the percentages for each timeframe according to the appropriate land use category in Table 14-3 to determine the number of required spaces. This is done for each timeframe category.
3. The numbers are summed for within each timeframe and the highest sum total in a timeframe is the required number of spaces.

Zoning Ordinance Article 14. Off-Street Parking and Loading
Per the Ordinance: The numbers are summed within each timeframe and the highest sum total in a timeframe is the required number of spaces. Therefore, with a straight parking calculation, 190 spaces are required. However, the shared parking provision allows this example multi-use office park to be constructed by-right with 154 spaces (the highest number of spaces within the various timeframes - the 9am to 5pm timeframe). This is because these timeframe calculations take into account the times of day the various uses utilize the most parking.

1502 LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS
A. Selection of Plant Materials
All plant materials shall be of good quality and meet American Association of Nurserymen (AAN) standards for minimum acceptable form, quality, and size for species selected, and capable to withstand the seasonal temperature variations of Rhode Island, as well as the individual site microclimate. The use of species native or naturalized to Rhode Island is encouraged. Size and density
City of Providence 15 2
Zoning Ordinance Article 15. Trees and Landscaping
of plant material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria that shall be considered when selecting plant material. Where appropriate, the use of drought and salt tolerant plant material is preferred.
B. Installation of Plant Materials
All landscape materials shall be installed in accordance with the current planting procedures established by the AAN. All plant materials shall be free of disease and installed so that soil of sufficient volume, composition, and nutrient balance are available to sustain healthy growth. Installation of plant materials during the appropriate growing season is encouraged.
C. Minimum Planting Sizes
1. Shade trees shall have a minimum trunk size of two inches in tree caliper at planting.
2. Evergreens trees shall have a minimum height of six feet at planting.
3. Single stem ornamental trees shall have a minimum trunk size of two inches in tree caliper at planting. Multiple stem ornamental trees shall have a minimum height of eight feet at planting.
4. Large deciduous and evergreen shrubs shall have minimum height of three feet at installation. Small deciduous and evergreen shrubs shall have a minimum height of 18 inches at installation. Large shrubs are those shrubs that reach five or more feet in height at maturity. Small shrubs are those shrubs that may grow up to five feet in height if left unmaintained, but are generally maintained at heights of 18 to 30 inches.
D. Species Diversity
Diversity is required in plant material for visual interest and to reduce the risk of losing a large population of plants due to disease.
E. Maintenance
1. Landscape material depicted on approved landscape plans is considered a required site element in the same manner as structures, parking, lighting, and other improvements. As such, the property owner is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of all landscape material, fences, walls, steps, retaining walls, and similar landscape elements.
2. All landscape material shall be maintained in good condition, present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance, and kept free of refuse and debris. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing plants shall be replaced within 60 days.
F. Tree Protection During Development
1. During development, all precautions shall be undertaken to prevent construction damage to existing trees, as described in the City Tree Ordinance of the Providence Code of Ordinances. Protection includes prevention of injury to the trunk, branches, and root systems.
2. No person may create a trench through the root system of an existing tree, expose the roots to the air overnight without a method for maintaining moisture, change the soil grade within the dripline of the tree, or cause soil compaction with the use of vehicles, machinery, or other method. The root systems of trees on adjacent lots shall also be protected.
1503 ON-SITE LANDSCAPING AND REQUIRED TREES
A. General Requirements
1. All portions of a lot not covered by structures or paved surfaces shall be landscaped with trees, shrubbery, grass, live groundcover, and other plantings. The landscape design may also include the use of stone, mulch beds, or other pervious landscaping materials (this excludes pervious pavement).
City of Providence 15 3
Zoning Ordinance Article 15. Trees and Landscaping
2. All existing plantings that are maintained on a site may be counted toward any required on-site landscaping.
3. Nothing in this section prohibits tree pruning to promote the health of a tree or for public safety purposes.
B. Significant Tree Preservation
1. A significant tree is any tree that measures 32 inches or more in diameter at four and one-half feet above the ground. No significant tree may be removed without the permission of the City Forester.
2. Any person wishing to remove a significant tree shall file a request with the City Forester. In order to grant permission to remove a significant tree, the City Forester shall make one or more of the following findings within 30 days of receipt of the request:
a. The tree is in poor health or diseased with an expected life span less than two years.
b. The removal of the tree is unavoidable because the tree poses a danger to property or human health, safety, and welfare.
c. The tree prevents the property owner from developing the property in conformance with this ordinance, and there are no alternatives to removal of the tree. In this case, the City Forester shall not approve removal of the tree until a permit for new construction has been approved.
3. Any person who removes a significant tree without prior permission from the City Forester or causes the death of a significant tree through negligent construction practices or other means, as determined by the City Forester, is subject to a one-time fine equivalent to the value of the tree. The tree value is established using the Trunk Formula Method set forth in the latest edition of Guide for Plant Appraisal, authored by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers, or the maximum fine allowed by Rhode Island General Laws, whichever is greater. Fines will be held by the Parks Department for forestry-related uses as determined by the City Forester.
C. Required Tree Canopy
1. Required Tree Canopy Percentage
Sufficient trees shall be retained and/or planted on a lot so that the square footage of vegetative canopy of such trees, when mature, equals a certain percentage of the square footage of the lot. This required percentage is established by district as follows:
a. All residential districts, and the PS, OS, and CD Districts: 30% of the square footage of the lot
b. I-1 and I-2 Districts: 30% of the square footage of the lot
c. D-1 District: 15% of the lot area not occupied by a structure
d. All other districts: 15% of the square footage of the lot
2. Calculation of Tree Canopy Coverage
The total canopy coverage for a lot is the sum of the canopy, at maturity, of the individual trees located on the lot. The square footage of canopy cover varies according to tree species. The City Forester maintains a list of trees species and the expected size of the canopy for each species, at maturity, when planted. Trees are classified as small, medium, or large and the canopy coverage credit for each classification is as follows:
a. Large: 1,000sf
b. Medium: 700sf
c. Small: 300sf
City of Providence 15 4
Zoning Ordinance Article 15. Trees and Landscaping
3. Tree Retention Bonus
Additional credit for canopy coverage may be granted for the retention of healthy trees of appropriate species and in the proper location, subject to the approval of the City Forester. The following thresholds and associated coverage bonus is as follows:
a. Tree diameter at four and one-half feet above the ground is between 10 and 19 inches: 300sf of canopy coverage credit
b. Tree diameter at four and one-half feet above the ground is 20 inches or greater: 700sf of canopy coverage credit
4. Street Tree Accommodation
Existing or planned street trees located in the public right-of-way directly adjacent to the lot line may be counted toward the canopy coverage for the lot.
5. Landscaping for Multiple Lots
For developments that encompass more than one lot, the percentage is calculated for the total canopy for the total area of all of the lots. For developments that span multiple blocks, the percentage required is calculated separately for each contiguous area of the development within a block.
6. Off-Site Planting Permission
Where existing conditions or other provisions of this Ordinance make it impracticable to meet the canopy coverage requirement on or adjacent to the site, the applicant shall plant sufficient trees to make up the shortfall in public rights-of-way within one-quarter mile of the lot, with the location to be determined by the City Forester.

4. Once the application is under consideration by the appropriate body, additional information or revisions requested during review do not constitute a substantive change to the application.
D. Concurrent Applications
When a development or proposal requires review by a board or commission and requires a variance or special use permit, the applications will be reviewed first by the board or commission, which shall make a preliminary determination and a recommendation to the Zoning Board of Review, then by the Zoning Board of Review, and then again by the board or commission.

iii. Granting the proposed special use permit will not be detrimental or injurious to the general health or welfare of the community.
c. To grant a special use permit for a health care institution or educational facility  college or university in a commercial or downtown district, the Zoning Board of Review, or the City Plan Commission, as part of unified development review, shall find that such uses are essential and desirable to the public convenience and welfare, are in conformance with the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, and that the following criteria have been met:

1902 VARIANCE
A. Authority
The Zoning Board of Review, or the City Plan Commission, as part of unified development review, will take formal action on variance applications.
B. Procedure
1. Upon receipt of a complete application for a variance, the Zoning Board of Review, or the City Plan Commission, as part of unified development review, will request that the Department of Planning and Development staff prepare a written report of the staffs findings and recommendations, which will be submitted to the applicable review body. The findings and recommendations shall include a statement on the general consistency of the application with the goals and purpose of the Comprehensive Plan.
2. The Zoning Board of Review, or the City Plan Commission, as part of unified development review, will hold a public hearing on the variance application in an expeditious manner, after receipt, in proper form, of an application, and shall give notice as required by Section 1801.
3. In granting a variance, the Zoning Board of Review, or the City Plan Commission, as part of unified development review, shall require that evidence to the satisfaction of the following standards be entered into the record of the proceedings:
a. That the hardship from which the applicant seeks relief is due to the unique characteristics of the subject land or structure and not to the general characteristics of the surrounding area; and is not due to a physical or economic disability of the applicant, excepting those physical disabilities addressed in Rhode Island General Laws §45-24-30(16).
b. That the hardship is not the result of any prior action of the applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the applicant to realize greater financial gain.
c. That the granting of the requested variance will not alter the general character of the surrounding area or impair the intent or purpose of this Ordinance or the Comprehensive Plan.
d. That the relief to be granted is the least relief necessary.
4. In addition, the Zoning Board of Review, or the City Plan Commission, as part of unified development review, requires that evidence be entered into the record of the proceedings showing that:
a. In granting a use variance, the subject land or structure cannot yield any beneficial use if it is required to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance. Nonconforming use of neighboring land or structures in the same district and permitted use of lands or structures in an adjacent district are not considered in granting a use variance.
b. In granting a dimensional variance, the hardship that will be suffered by the owner of the subject property if the dimensional variance is not granted will amount to more than a mere
City of Providence 195
Zoning Ordinance Article 19. Zoning Applications and Approvals
inconvenience. The fact that a use may be more profitable or that a structure may be more valuable after the relief is granted is not grounds for relief.
5. In addition to the above, the Zoning Board of Review, or the City Plan Commission, as part of unified development review, will consider the written opinion of the Department of Planning and Development prior to making a decision on a variance petition.
C. Conditions
The Zoning Board of Review, or the City Plan Commission, as part of unified development review, may impose such conditions regarding the proposed variance as it deems appropriate. Special conditions may be required, in the opinion of the Zoning Board of Review, or the City Plan Commission, as part of unified development review, to promote the intent and purposes of the Comprehensive Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. Failure to abide by any special conditions attached to approval constitutes a zoning violation. Those special conditions shall be based on competent credible evidence on the record, be incorporated into the decision, and may include, but are not limited to, provisions for:
1. Minimizing the adverse impact of the development upon other land, including the type, intensity, design, and performance of activities.
2. Controlling the sequence of development, including when it shall be commenced and completed.
3. Controlling the duration of use or development and the time within which any temporary structure shall be removed.
4. Assuring satisfactory installation and maintenance of required public improvements.
5. Designating the exact location and nature of development.
6. Establishing detailed records by submission of drawings, maps, plats, or specifications.
D. Expiration
Any variance granted by the City Plan Commission, in conjunction with a land development project or subdivision as part of unified development review, shall expire when the approval for the associated land development project or subdivision expires.
Any variance granted by the Zoning Board of Review shall expire six months after the date of the filing of the resolution in the Office of the Board unless the applicant, within the six months:
1. Obtains a legal, complete building permit for the project and proceeds with construction of the proposed improvements. For purposes of this section, demolition permits and foundation permits are not construed to be building permits.
2. Obtains a legal building permit or a certificate of occupancy when no construction is required.
E. Extension of Time
1. The Zoning Board of Review may, upon written request and for cause shown prior to the expiration of the initial six month period, renew the variance for a second six month period. The request for an extension need not be advertised.
2. If an applicant fails to obtain a legal building permit within the second six month period, the Zoning Board of Review may upon written request prior to the end of the second six month period, renew the variance for a third six month period provided that the applicant can demonstrate due diligence in proceeding and substantial financial commitment in promoting the subject of the variance since the date of the filing of the resolution. The request for the third six month period shall be advertised and notice given in accordance with Section 1801. A hearing will be held on the request.
3. No extension may be granted during an appeal to Superior Court.

City of Providence 1911
Zoning Ordinance Article 19. Zoning Applications and Approvals
which involve activity regulated by this section, Downtown Design Review Committee or staff approval is still required.
3. The type of review for all development in the D-1 District depends on the type of work being done.
a. Downtown Design Review Committee Review. The Downtown Design Review Committee will review all applications for waivers, development incentives, moving of structures, and demolition. Within the DD Downcity Overlay District, the Downtown Design Review Committee will also review all applications for major alterations, additions, and new construction. The review will be held during a regular meeting of the Downtown Design Review Committee open to the public, for which at least seven days advance written notice has been given by first class mail to the applicant, property owner, abutting property owners, and all others requesting notice of the Downtown Design Review Committee meetings.
b. Downtown Design Review Committee Staff Review.

However, within 15 days of receipt of a complete application for a major alteration, addition, or new construction that requires staff review, notice shall be sent by first class mail to the applicant, property owner, and abutting property owners, that notifies them that a complete application has been received.
4. A determination by the Downtown Design Review Committee or its staff shall be made within 60 days of receipt and determination of a complete application. This time period may be extended by mutual agreement between the applicant and the Downtown Design Review Committee or staff. In the event that the Downtown Design Review Committee makes a determination within the 60 day period that a particular application requires further time for additional study and information, the Downtown Design Review Committee has a period of up to 90 days from the date of acceptance of a complete application within which to act on such application.

iii. Granting of the waiver is in the best interest of good planning, urban design, and/or architecture practice, as evidenced by consistency with the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
2. Downtown District Demolition Waivers
a. Purpose
In order to preserve the urban fabric of the D-1 District, no building may be demolished, in whole or in part, until the Downtown Design Review Committee or the Capital Center Commission, as applicable, has granted a waiver to demolish the building and has approved plans for new construction. In reviewing an application for a demolition waiver, the Downtown Design Review Committee or the Capital Center Commission shall consider the historic value and architectural quality of the existing building, regardless of condition; the design of new structures for the site if demolition is approved; and how the design of new structures relates to adjacent structures. The intent of this section is that new construction shall immediately follow demolition. Demolition is only permitted by waiver from the Downtown Design Review Committee or the Capital Center Commission.
b. Authority
The Downtown Design Review Committee or the Capital Center Commission, as applicable, may approve demolition in the D-1 District. Demolition within the D-1 District is approved by the Downtown Design Review Committee, with the exception of the Capital Center Special Development District review, where the Capital Center Commission approves demolition and follows the same process as review by the Downtown Design Review Committee.
c. Procedure
i. A waiver application shall contain an analysis of the buildings historic or architectural significance, the reason(s) for the proposed demolition, and plans, with elevations, of proposed new construction. The staff shall certify the application complete in accordance with Section 1800.

iv. If the Downtown Design Review Committee finds that the building is eligible for demolition, and finds that the proposed new construction conforms to the standards of this section, the Downtown Design Review Committee will give preliminary approval for the demolition of the structure and preliminary approval for new construction. Preliminary approvals for demolition and new construction expire after one year unless extended by the Director of the Department of Planning and Development.
v. The Downtown Design Review Committee may, at the applicants expense, hire experts to opine on the validity of evidence and testimony submitted as part of a demolition application. This may include, but not be limited to, an initial evaluation of the historic or architectural significance of the building, and for structures found by the Downtown Design
City of Providence 1913
Zoning Ordinance Article 19. Zoning Applications and Approvals
Review Committee to be historically or architecturally significant, an appraisal of the property, and/or structural analysis of the building.
vi. Subsequent to the Downtown Design Review Committee granting preliminary approvals for demolition and new construction, the applicant shall present final plans for new construction to the Downtown Design Review Committee. The Downtown Design Review Committee shall review the plans pursuant to the guidelines and procedures of this section and the D-1 District. Concurrent with the issuance of a certificate of design approval, the Downtown Design Review Committee shall issue final approval for demolition.
vii. Subsequent to receiving a certificate of design approval and a final approval for demolition, the applicant shall apply to the Director for building and demolition permits. Such applications shall be made concurrently. The Director will not issue a demolition permit before the complete building permit for the new construction approved by the Downtown Design Review Committee has been issued. For purposes of this section, foundation permits are not construed to be building permits.
d. Eligibility for Demolition
A building is eligible for a demolition waiver if it meets both items i and ii below:
i. The proposed reuse of the site is a permitted use for the D-1 District and is in conformance with the regulations of the D-1 District.

(1) Retention of such building constitutes a hazard to public safety which hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the owner, including sale of the building on its present site to any purchaser willing to preserve such building.
(2) Preservation of such building would cause undue or unreasonable financial hardship to the owner, taking into account the financial resources available to the owner including sale of the building to any purchaser willing to preserve such building.
(3) The merits of the proposal for new construction far outweigh the merits of preserving the building.
e. Emergency Demolition
Should the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards determine that a structure is unsafe or hazardous and an imminent hazard to public safety for a reason such as being in danger of imminent collapse from damage caused by human action or an act of God, a committee consisting of the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards, Fire Marshal, Planning Director, a structural engineer to be hired under City auspices, and the Chair of the Downtown Design Review Committee, or their designees, shall convene immediately to evaluate whether the structure should be demolished. The committee shall evaluate all pertinent information including, but not limited to, the structural condition of the structure, the historic value of the structure, and the danger to the public. The Director may order partial or full demolition based on the consensus of the committee. If the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards, in consultation with on-site life safety officials, determines that the structure is in danger of imminent collapse or is an immediate danger to public safety and there is no time to convene the aforementioned committee, he/she may order the structure demolished immediately. The Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards shall issue a report to the Downtown Design Review Committee stating the reasons for the order.

1911 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS
A. Purpose
Before a property owner commences construction, alteration, repair, removal, or demolition of any existing structure or its appurtenances within a Historic District Overlay District, the owner shall be granted a certificate of appropriateness from the Historic District Commission. A certificate of appropriateness is required whether or not a building permit is required.
B. Initiation
A property owner, or person expressly authorized in writing by the property owner, shall file an application for a certificate of appropriateness for any development, including demolition, within a Historic District Overlay District. A property owner may only file an application for a certificate of appropriateness for property under his/her control.
C. Authority
1. The Historic District Commission, as applicable, will approve a certificate of appropriateness. The Historic District Commission may delegate to the staff authority to issue a certificate of appropriateness in certain circumstances without a public hearing in accordance with the Standards and Guidelines as adopted or by action of the Historic District Commission at a public hearing. The staff may not deny a certificate of appropriateness, but shall refer such action to the Historic District Commission for a hearing.
2. The Historic District Commission may, at the applicants expense, hire experts to opine on the validity of evidence and testimony submitted as part of a demolition application. This may include, but is not limited to, an initial evaluation of the historic or architectural significance of the building, and, for structures found by the Historic District Commission to be historically or architecturally significant, an appraisal of the property and/or structural analysis of the building.
D. Applicability
All construction, alteration, repair, removal, or demolition of any existing structure or its appurtenances within a Historic District Overlay District requires a certificate of appropriateness.
E. Procedure
1. Within 45 days of receipt of a complete application, the Historic District Commission shall hold a public meeting on an application for a certificate of appropriateness. Notice is required in accordance with Section 1801.
2. An application for a certificate of appropriateness may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied. The Historic District Commission shall issue written findings for the reasons and basis of each decision regarding the certificate of appropriateness. When denying an application, the Historic District Commission shall include the basis for its finding of denial that the proposed activity would be incongruous with those aspects of the structure, appurtenances, or the district which the Commission has determined to be historically or architecturally significant. The Historic District Commission shall send a copy of the decision to the applicant and to the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards and the action taken by the Historic District Commission is binding on the Director. No application may be denied without a hearing.
3. If the Historic District Commission fails to act within 45 days of receipt of a complete application, the application is deemed approved, unless an extension of time has been agreed to by the applicant and the Historic District Commission.
City of Providence 1921
Zoning Ordinance Article 19. Zoning Applications and Approvals
4. If the Historic District Commission makes a finding of fact within the 45 day period that a particular application requires additional time for study and information, then the Historic District Commission has an additional 90 days from the date of the receipt of a complete application to act upon such application. An extension of time may be agreed to by the applicant and the Historic District Commission beyond this 90 day period.
5. A certificate of appropriateness may be issued without a public hearing for ordinary maintenance or repair of any structure within an historic district provided that such maintenance or repair does not result in any change of design, type of material, or appearance of the structure or its appurtenances. The Historic District Commission may delegate to the staff the authority to approve and issue certificates of appropriateness in such circumstances.
F. Approval Standards
1. General
The Historic District Commission will evaluate all applications in accordance with the criteria established in its adopted Standards and Guidelines. The Historic District Commission acts only on exterior features of a structure and its appurtenances. In reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Historic District Commission has the power to call in experts to aid in its deliberations and may incorporate the conclusions of such experts in its decisions.
2. Special Criteria for Demolition
In order to preserve the historic fabric of the City, demolition of historic properties is discouraged. When reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness to demolish an historic structure or appurtenance, the Historic District Commission shall consider the following criteria, in addition to the provisions of the adopted Standards and Guidelines.
a. Structures Valuable to the City
In the case of an application for demolition of any structure, appurtenance, or a portion of a structure which the Historic District Commission deems so valuable to the City, the state, or the nation, that the loss thereof will be a great loss to the City, the state, or the nation, the Historic District Commission will endeavor to work out with the owner an economically feasible plan for the preservation of such structure on its present site. The Historic District Commission may issue a certificate of appropriateness to demolish only if it is satisfied that the retention of such structure constitutes a hazard to public safety which hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the owner, including sale of the structure to any purchaser willing to preserve such structure.
b. Structures Valuable for the Period
In the case of an application for demolition of any structure, appurtenance, or a portion of a structure deemed to be valuable for the period of architecture which it represents and its importance to the neighborhood within which it exists, the Historic District Commission may issue a certificate of appropriateness to demolish only if it finds that at least one of the following conditions exists:
i. Retention of such structure constitutes a hazard to public safety which hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the owner, including sale of the structure on its present site to any purchaser willing to preserve such structure.
ii. Preservation of such structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community.
iii. Preservation of such structure would cause undue or unreasonable financial hardship to the owner, taking into account the financial resources available to the owner including sale of the structure to any purchaser willing to preserve such structure.
iv. Preservation of such structure would not be in the interest of the majority of the community.
City of Providence 1922
Zoning Ordinance Article 19. Zoning Applications and Approvals
G. Demolition Regulations
1. Alternatives to Demolition
The Historic District Commission will assist the owner in identifying and evaluating alternatives to demolition, including sale of the structure on its present site. When considering an application to demolish a structure of historic or architectural value, in addition to any other criteria, the Historic District Commission shall consider the following:
a. Whether there is a reasonable likelihood that some person or group other than the current owner is willing to purchase, move, and preserve such structure.
b. Whether the owner has made continuing, bona fide and reasonable efforts to sell the structure to any such purchaser willing to move and preserve such structure.
2. Avoiding Demolition Through Owner Neglect
The City Council, or its designee, in consultation with the Historic District Commission, may identify structures of historical or architectural value whose deteriorated physical condition endangers the preservation of such structure or its appurtenances. The Council will publish standards for maintenance of properties within historic districts. Upon the petition of the Historic District Commission that a historic structure is so deteriorated that its preservation is endangered, the Council may establish a reasonable time of no less than 30 days within which the owner shall begin repairs. If the owner has not begun repairs within the allowed time, the Council or its designee shall hold a hearing at which the owner may appear and state his reasons for not commencing repairs. If the owner does not appear at the hearing or does not comply with the Council's orders, the Council or its designee may cause the required repairs to be made at the expense of the City and cause a lien to be placed against the property for repayment. The Historic District Commission will cooperate with and assist the City Council in exercising the provisions of this section.
3. Emergency Demolition
Should the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards determine that a structure is unsafe or hazardous and an imminent hazard to public safety for a reason such as being in danger of imminent collapse from damage caused by human action or an act of God, a committee consisting of the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards, Fire Marshal, Planning Director, a structural engineer to be hired under City auspices, and the Chair of the Historic District Commission, or their designees, shall convene immediately to evaluate whether the structure shall be demolished. The committee shall evaluate all pertinent information including, but not limited to, the structural condition of the structure, the historic value of the structure, and the danger to the public. The Director may order partial or full demolition based on the consensus of the committee. If the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards, in consultation with on-site life safety officials, determines that the structure is in danger of imminent collapse or is an immediate danger to public safety and there is no time to convene the aforementioned committee, he/she may order the structure demolished immediately. The Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards shall issue a report to the Historic District Commission stating the reasons for the order.
H. Inspections
The Historic District Commission may inspect work in progress after a certificate of appropriateness has been issued to insure that work is proceeding in accordance with the approval received. If the Historic District Commission finds that the work in progress does not conform to the certificate of appropriateness, the Historic District Commission will advise the Director of the Department of Inspection and Standards, who will enforce the requirements of the Certificate of Appropriateness in accordance with this Ordinance.
I. Appeals
An aggrieved party has the right to appeal a decision of the Historic District Commission to the Zoning Board of Review, and a further right of appeal from the Zoning Board of Review to the Superior Court, and from the Superior Court to the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari. The appeal to the Zoning Board

2000 GENERAL APPLICABILITY
2001 NONCONFORMING USE
2002 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE
2003 NONCONFORMING LOT
2004 NONCONFORMING SITE ELEMENTS
2005 NONCONFORMING SIGNS
2000 GENERAL APPLICABILITY
A. Authority to Continue
Any structure, use, lot, site element, or sign that legally existed as a nonconformity as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and any structure, use, lot, site element, or sign that has been made nonconforming as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and any subsequent amendments, may continue subject to the provisions of this Article so long as it remains otherwise legal. A structure, use, lot, site element, or sign that is illegal as of the effective date of this Ordinance, remains illegal if it does not conform with every requirement of this Ordinance.
B. Burden on Property Owner
The burden of establishing the legality of a nonconformity under the provisions of this Ordinance is the responsibility of the property owner of the nonconforming structure, lot, site element, or sign, or the operator of the use.
C. Safety Regulations
All police power regulations enacted to promote public health, safety, and welfare including, but not limited to, all building, fire, and health codes apply to nonconformities.
D. Relationship to Variances and Special Use Permits
Any use or dimensional variation that does not conform to this ordinance and which exists by virtue of a special use permit, use variance or a dimensional variance, granted by the Zoning Board of Review shall not be considered a nonconformity for the purposes of this Section. Such use or dimensional variation shall be considered a use by special use permit, use variance or dimensional variance, respectively. Any moving, addition, enlargement, expansion, intensification or change of such use to any use other than a permitted use shall require an application for a special use permit or variance from the Zoning Board of Review, in accordance with this ordinance.
2001 NONCONFORMING USE
A. Definition
A nonconforming use is the use of a structure or land that at one time was an allowed use within a zoning district but because of subsequent amendments to the Ordinance is no longer allowed.
B. Expansion
A nonconforming use of a structure or land cannot be expanded. This includes expansion, extension, or relocation of a nonconforming use to any other structure on the lot, additional gross floor area devoted to the nonconforming use, or occupying any land area currently not occupied by such nonconforming use.
C. Intensification
A nonconforming use of a structure or land cannot be intensified in any manner. Intensification includes, but is not limited to, increasing hours of operation, increasing the number of dwelling units, increasing the number of parking spaces, reducing total land area through a subdivision, or increasing the seating or occupancy capacity of any use. However, this does not prohibit the reconfiguration of existing dwelling units within a structure so long as such reconfiguration complies with the requirements of item
City of Providence 202 Zoning Ordinance Article 20. Nonconformities
B above.
D. Relocation
A nonconforming use cannot be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot. The nonconforming use may only be relocated to another structure or lot if the use conforms to all regulations of the zoning district where it is relocated.
E. Change of Use
1. Residential Districts
Within any residential district, a nonconforming use may not be changed to any other nonconforming use. Within residential districts, a portion of a building containing a nonconforming use may be converted to a single dwelling unit, regardless of the maximum number of units permitted by the dimensional regulations in this Ordinance.
2. Non-Residential Districts
Within any non-residential district, a nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use by special use permit if the Zoning Board of Review deems the proposed use to be less intensive than the existing use.
F. Discontinuation or Abandonment
1. If a nonconforming use is abandoned, it may not be reestablished. Abandonment of a nonconforming use consists of some overt act, or failure to act, which leads one to believe that the owner of the nonconforming use neither claims nor retains any interest in continuing the nonconforming use unless the owner can demonstrate an intent not to abandon the use. An involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, as by fire and natural catastrophe, does not establish the intent to abandon the nonconforming use. However, if any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one year, the owner of the nonconforming use is presumed to have abandoned the nonconforming use, unless that presumption is rebutted by the presentation of sufficient evidence of intent not to abandon the use.
G. Damage or Destruction
In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is structurally damaged or destroyed through no fault of the property owner or tenant, the nonconforming use may be re-established provided that no new nonconformities are created and the degree of the previous nonconformity is not increased. If the structure containing the nonconforming use is a nonconforming structure, the structure may only be rebuilt, restored, repaired, or reconstructed in accordance with Section 2002. However, if a building permit is not obtained within one year of the date of damage or destruction, then the nonconforming use may not be reestablished.
2002 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE
A. Definition
A nonconforming structure is a principal or accessory structure that at one time conformed to zoning district regulations but because of subsequent amendments to the Ordinance no longer conforms to applicable dimensional and/or bulk regulations. Certain nonconforming site elements are regulated separately by Section 2004.
B. Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair may be performed on any nonconforming structure. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity.
City of Providence 203 Zoning Ordinance Article 20. Nonconformities
C. Structural Alterations
No structural alterations are permitted on any nonconforming structure, except in the following situations:
1. When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore the structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with protecting public safety.
2. When the alteration will eliminate the nonconformity.
3. When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing nonconformity. For example, if a structure is nonconforming in terms of the required front setback (i.e., does not meet the required minimum), the structure may add a rear addition if it meets all other district regulations.
D. Relocation
A nonconforming structure cannot be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot unless such relocation would make the structure conforming. A nonconforming structure may be relocated to another lot if the structure conforms to all regulations of the zoning district where it is relocated.
E. Damage or Destruction
1. In the event that a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by the fault of the property owner or tenant, the structure, as restored or repaired, shall be rebuilt to comply with all requirements of this Ordinance.
2. In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed through no fault of the property owner or tenant, it may be repaired or rebuilt to the same size and dimension as previously existed, provided that a building permit is obtained within one year following the damage or destruction.
F. Extension of Walls for Nonconforming Single-Family, Two-Family, Semi-Detached, and Three-Family Dwellings
Where a single-family, two-family, semi-detached, or three-family dwelling is deemed nonconforming because of encroachment into the required interior side or rear yard, the structure may be enlarged or extended vertically or horizontally along the same plane as defined by its existing perimeter walls, so long as the resulting structure does not increase the degree of the existing nonconformity or otherwise violate this Ordinance. (Figure 20-1)
City of Providence 204 Zoning Ordinance Article 20. Nonconformities
FIGURE 20-1
2003 NONCONFORMING LOT
A. Definition
A nonconforming lot is synonymous with a substandard lot of record, as defined in Section 201.
B. Use
Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a nonconforming lot of record in a residential district may be used for a single-family dwelling.
C. Development
Development of a nonconforming lot shall meet all applicable dimensional or bulk regulations of the district in which it is located.
City of Providence 205 Zoning Ordinance Article 20. Nonconformities
D. Enlargement or Subdivision of Substandard Lots
Lawfully established lots which have less than the minimum area requirements, may be maintained and may be changed by adding additional land to such lots without prejudice to the rights of the owner of such lots pursuant to the provisions of this Section. Such lots may be reconfigured by adjusting lot lines so long as no new nonconformities are created.
E. Merger of Substandard Lots of Record
In all residential districts, two or more contiguous lawfully established substandard lots of record are considered to be one lot and undivided for the purpose of this Ordinance if all of the following conditions exist:
1. The lots are under the same ownership on or anytime after October 24, 1991.
2. One or more of the lots is less than 3,200 square feet.
3. The merger would not result in more than one principal building on the lot. For purposes of this provision, a garage is not considered a principal building.
4. The merger would not create a through lot.
A subdivision of lots that are merged by this section may be performed in accordance with the City Plan Commissions regulations, without zoning relief, to create lots that are conforming by dimension to the regulations of Table 4-1 for new subdivisions.
2004 NONCONFORMING SITE ELEMENTS
A. Definition
A nonconforming site element is a site development element, such as landscaping, fences or walls, lighting, parking, and site paving, that at one time conformed to the requirements of this Ordinance, but because of subsequent amendments, has been made nonconforming.
B. Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair to a nonconforming site element may be performed. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the previously existing nonconformity.
C. Required Conformance
All nonconforming site elements shall be brought into conformance when the following occurs:
1. The existing principal structure is demolished and a new structure is constructed.
2. A new principal structure is constructed.
3. The existing principal structure is increased in total building footprint by 30% or more.
4. An existing parking lot of 10 or more spaces is fully reconstructed or repaved or an existing parking lot area is expanded by 50%. Resealing or re-striping of an existing parking lot, which does not entail paving, resurfacing, or replacement of the asphalt, concrete, or other surface paving material, is not considered reconstruction.
5. When 50% or more of the length of a fence or wall is reconstructed along any one lot line, all fences or walls on the site shall be brought into conformance.
6. When 25% or more of exterior lighting fixtures are replaced, all exterior lighting on the site shall be brought into conformance.
City of Providence 206 Zoning Ordinance Article 20. Nonconformities
7. Landscaping shall be brought into conformance when any of the following development activities occur. The limits of disturbance is defined as the boundary within which all construction, grading, paving or repaving, landscaping, and related activities occur.
a. Full conformance is required for the entire development or area within the limits of disturbance, whichever is less.
b. If the area within the limits of disturbance equals more than 50% of the area of the lot or lots being developed, the entire development shall conform.

A. A nonconforming sign and sign structure may remain in use, so long as it remains otherwise lawful and has not been damaged, destroyed, or removed as described in Paragraph D below. The sign face of an existing nonconforming sign may be replaced, but the structure cannot be altered to accommodate such change.
B. No nonconforming sign and sign structure may be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same or other lot, unless the entire sign and sign structure conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in which the sign is relocated.
C. No nonconforming sign can be altered or enlarged in a way that increases the nonconformity of the sign or sign structure. This in no way precludes normal maintenance and cleaning or changing of the sign face.
D. In the event that any nonconforming sign and sign structure is damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than 50% of its value prior to the damage, the sign and sign structure cannot be restored or repaired unless it conforms to all applicable regulations for the district.
E. Any nonconforming sign that is located on property that has failed to maintain a valid business license or that becomes vacant and unoccupied for a period of one year or more is presumed abandoned. Abandoned nonconforming signs shall be removed by the owner of the sign or the property owner of the premises. No permits or approvals may be issued for buildings with nonconforming abandoned signs until such signs are removed. No business license may be issued for businesses with nonconforming abandoned signs after the date that such nonconforming signs are required to be removed or come into conformance.
