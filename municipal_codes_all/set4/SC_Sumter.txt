    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Sumter, South Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1998 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1998 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Dan Walker, Code Attorney, and Kim Ryder, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Linda Hammett, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(a)  The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted.

Sec. 1-9. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, when necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
(Code 1998, § 1-9) 
Sec. 1-10. - Certain ordinances, rights, rates, franchises, taxes, contracts and provisions not affected by Code. 
(a)  Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code shall affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture incurred before the effective date of this Code or any ordinance: 
(1)  Promising or guaranteeing the payment of money for the city, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the city or any evidence of the city's indebtedness, or any contract or obligations assumed by the city.

(8)  Adopting community antenna television system regulations. 
(9)  Providing for local improvements and assessing taxes therefor. 
(10)  Dedicating or accepting any plat or subdivision in the city, and establishing and amending zoning provisions. 
(11)  Adopting, extending or contracting the boundaries of the city. 
(12)  Prescribing the number, classification, or compensation of any city officers, employees or agents, not inconsistent herewith.

(Ord. No. 2319, § I, 6-17-2008; Ord. No. 2592, § I, 12-19-2017) 
Sec. 2-252. - Source selection and contract formation. 
(a)  Methods of source selection. Except where noted herein, all city contracts shall be awarded by one of the following methods: 
(1)  Invitation for bids (subsection 2-252(b)); 
(2)  Request for proposals (subsection 2-252(c)); 
(3)  Emergency procurement (subsection 2-252(d)); 
(4)  Small purchases (subsection 2-252(e)); 
(5)  Sole source (subsection 2-252(f)); or 
(6)  Project delivery methods (subsection 2-252(g)). 
(b)  Invitation for bids. 
(1)  Notice of invitation for bids. An invitation for bids shall include (or state where such information is available) a purchase or project description, together with the contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. The invitation for bids shall be publicly announced. The director shall determine in his or her discretion the appropriate method by which an invitation for bids is publicly announced. 
(2)  Receipt and opening of bids. All bids (whether sealed or not) received prior to the bid opening shall be kept secure and unopened. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The director or his or her designee shall tabulate the name of each bidder, the amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as he or she deems appropriate. The final bid tabulation shall be made available upon request to all bidders after contract award. 
(3)  Bid evaluation and bid acceptance. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids and any addenda thereto. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not set forth in such invitation for bids or addenda. Subject to the city's right to reject all bids, the selected bid shall be accepted unconditionally without alteration or correction, except as otherwise authorized in this ordinance or by the city manager in writing. Prior to accepting or rejecting the lowest bid, the director shall have the authority to negotiate with the low bidder for modifications of the low bid and the proposed contract, unless the invitations for bids specifically provides to the contrary. 
(4)  Correction or withdrawal of bids. Cancellation of awards. The director may permit, in his or her discretion, correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before bid opening, withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids after award, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes. 
After bid opening, and except as set forth in the next sentence, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the city or fair competition shall be permitted. The city manager, following consultation with the finance director and the director, may permit changes in bid prices after bid opening if (a) the bidder demonstrates a legitimate error in the bid and documents the need for and degree of the requested change, and (b) the change in price does not change the identity of the prevailing responsible/responsive bidder. The determination to permit such a change after bid opening shall be in writing and signed by the city manager, the finance director, and the director. 
(5)  Award. If an award is to be made, the contract shall be awarded by written notice or purchase order to the lowest responsible/responsive bidder. In determining responsibility, the director may consider: 
a.  The ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
b.  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the services promptly or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
c.  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the bidder; 
d.  The quality of performance of previous contracts or services by the bidder; 
e.  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with the laws and ordinances relating to the contract or services; 
f.  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or to provide the service; 
g.  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or contractual services to the particular use required; and 
h.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract. 
In addition, the director may allow the lowest local bidder (defined as a bidder maintaining a place of business physically located and operating within the limits of Sumter County), whose bid is within five percent of the lowest non-local bidder, to match the bid submitted by the non-local bidder and thereby be awarded the contract, if: 
1.  The total purchase price is $25,000.00 or more; 
2.  The local bidder has a valid business license issued by Sumter County or one of the municipalities within Sumter County, which business license was issued at least 12 months prior to bid opening date; and 
3.  For a period of 12 months or more the local bidder has maintained a physical business address (not including a Post Office Box) located within the limits of Sumter County; 
Provided, however, that if the procurement is to be made pursuant to state or federal guidelines that prohibit or restrict local preference, then there shall be no local preference. 
In the event two or more bidders are tied in price while otherwise meeting all of the required conditions, the contract shall be awarded to the local bidder. If two or more of such bids are submitted by local bidders, the director shall award the contract to one of the local tie bidders by drawing lots in public. If local bidders are not involved in the tie bids, the director shall award the contract to one of the outside tie bidders by drawing lots in public. 
(6)  Right of rejection and resolicitation. The director has the right, prior to award of the contract, to reject any and all bids for cause, or without cause, as he or she deems appropriate. The city has the right to determine not to award the contract to any bidder or to determine to resolicit bids based upon modified terms and conditions. 
(c)  Request for proposals. 
(1)  Selection committee. For each project in which a request for proposals is used, the director or the relevant department head will establish a selection committee (the "committee") of at least two members. The director and the relevant department head may be members of the committee. 
(2)  Notice of request for proposals. The request for proposals shall include (or state where such information is to be made available) a description of the project, enumerating all required services for the project. The request for proposals shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. The request for proposals shall be publicly announced. The director shall determine in his or her discretion the appropriate method by which a request for proposals is publicly announced. 
(3)  Receipt and safeguarding of proposals. All proposals (whether or not sealed) received prior to the proposal opening shall be kept secure and unopened. 
(4)  Evaluation factors. The request for proposals shall list evaluation criteria in the order of their relative importance, but need not require numerical weighting. No factors or criteria that are not included in the request for proposals may be used in evaluation, provided that the request for proposals may contain provisions allowing minor amendments to the evaluation criteria prior to award. If the request for proposals provides for numerical weighting of evaluation criteria, then the city must adhere to such weightings. The committee shall document the basis on which the award is made and shall make a determination of responsibility. The written documentation and determination may be included in the purchase order, or may be otherwise formalized in such method as may be determined by the director in his or her discretion. 
(5)  Negotiation. The committee will review all submissions, and may interview those responding persons deemed by the committee to be most qualified. Following such review, the committee shall determine the most qualified proposer, and may negotiate a contract with such proposer. In the event a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated with the most qualified proposer, the committee may negotiate a contract with the next most qualified proposer, and so on, until a satisfactory contract can be negotiated. Nothing contained herein requires the committee to negotiate a contract with an unqualified proposer or with a proposer who submits an unresponsive proposal. 
(6)  Local and/or DBE preference. The request for proposals may establish an evaluation criterion that favors local proposers and/or proposers that meet Federal guidelines as a "disadvantaged business enterprise," provided that such criterion may not exceed ten percent of the total scoring methodology. 
(7)  Right to withdraw and resolicit. Until award, the director has the right to determine not to award the contract to any proposer or to determine to resolicit proposals based upon modified terms and conditions. 
(d)  Emergency procurement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, the city manager or the director may make or authorize others to make emergency procurements when there exists an immediate threat to public health, welfare, critical economy and efficiency, or safety under emergency conditions, provided that such emergency procurements shall be made as competitively as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances. The director or the city's general counsel shall prepare a written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor (which determination may be included in the purchase order). 
(e)  Small purchases. Any procurement not exceeding $25,000.00 may be made by the director following procedures established by the director to ensure appropriate competitiveness. The general procedures for small purchases shall be set forth by the director in writing, and must be approved by the city manager. At a minimum, such procedures shall require the solicitation of informal or telephonic bids or proposals from at least three different, unrelated persons or entities. 
(f)  Sole source. A contract may be awarded for a property, supply, service, or construction item without competition if the director determines in writing (which determination may be included in the purchase order) that there is only one legitimate and efficacious source for the required property, supply, service, or construction item. After determining that a sole source purchase is warranted, the director has the authority to negotiate the price, terms, and conditions of the procurement. Examples of a permissible, non-competitive procurement include, but are not limited to, those situations where the director, or a requesting department head, has determined that the compatibility of equipment, accessories, services, systems, software, or replacement parts is of paramount importance. 
(g)  Project delivery methods. The city may use construction manager at-risk, design-build, design-build-operate-maintain and design-build-finance-operate-maintain services as alternative project delivery methods in appropriate circumstances. The director may determine in his or her discretion the appropriate procedure to award a contract for one of these delivery methods. 
(h)  Prequalification of bidders. 
(1)  The director may prequalify all prospective bidders or proposers. 
(2)  Notice of prequalification shall be publicly announced and shall set forth the criteria (or state where such criteria are to be made available) by which the qualifications of prospective bidders shall be determined. Only those criteria set forth in the prequalification notice may be considered in prequalifying bidders. The director shall make prequalification decisions in the exercise of his or her reasonable discretion, and shall make a written determination of the bases for the prequalification decision (which determination may be included in the purchase order). Prior to issuance of an invitation for bids or request for proposals, all prospective bidders or proposers that were provided with prequalification notices will be notified of the director's decisions relating to prequalification. 
(i)  Bond and security. 
(1)  Bid security may be required for all construction contracts entered into pursuant to an invitation for bids. If required, bid security shall be one or more bonds provided by one or more surety companies meeting the criteria established by the director. If required, bid security shall be in an amount equal to at least five percent of the bid, unless a higher percentage is specified in the invitation for bids. Any bid that does not comply with the bid security requirements shall be rejected. 
(2)  When a construction contract or other contract to improve real property is awarded and the value of such contract exceeds $50,000.00, the city shall require the contractor to provide a performance bond and a labor and material payment bond in the full amount of the contract. The bond must be secured by cash or must be issued by a surety company that is acceptable to the city. 
(3)  Nothing in subparagraph (2) above shall be construed to limit the authority of the city to require a performance bond or other security in addition to the bonds specified above. 
(4)  Bonding requirements may be temporarily waived for any emergency procurement. 
(j)  Exempted items. 
(1)  City council, upon recommendation of the city manager, may exempt by ordinance specific items, services, or projects from the purchasing procedures required in this division when council finds that such exemption is in the interest of the city and its citizens.

(5)  The director may procure goods or services pursuant to an existing contract held by another public procurement unit or co-operative purchasing entity, upon a determination that such contract was awarded pursuant to appropriately competitive procedures. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is hereby declared that contracts held by the State of South Carolina, any agency or political subdivision thereof, or the General Services Administration (GSA) for the purchase of goods or supplies were awarded pursuant to appropriately competitive procedures. 
(k)  Repeat orders. The director may approve the purchase of additional goods or services pursuant to a procurement for up to twelve months following the expiration of the awarded contract, provided that the per unit price of such goods or services may not exceed the per unit price specified in the original award by more than five percent.

ARTICLE III. - AIRPORT HAZARD REGULATIONS 

Sec. 7-35. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  It is hereby found that an obstruction has a potential for endangering the lives and property of users of Sumter Municipal Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction may affect existing or future instrument approaches of Sumter Municipal Airport; and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircrafts, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of Sumter Municipal Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared: 
(1)  That the creation or establishment of an obstruction has a potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by Sumter Municipal Airport; 
(2)  That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented; and 
(3)  The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of police power without compensation. 
(b)  It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment of hazards to air navigation, the elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation or the marking and lighting of the obstructions are public purposes for which a political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire lands or interest inland.

Sec. 7-36. - Short title; definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Airport means Sumter Municipal Airport. 
    Airport elevation means the highest point of an airport's usable landing area measured in feet from mean sea level (182 feet at Sumter Municipal Airport). 
    Airport hazard means any structure or object of natural growth located on or in the vicinity of a public airport, or any use of land near such airport, which obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or takeoff at such airport or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or takeoff of aircraft. 
    Airport height means, for the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this article and shown on the zoning map, the mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified. 
    Approach, transitional, horizontal, and conical zones apply to the area under the approach, transitional, horizontal, and conical surfaces defined in the Sumter Airport Hazard Zoning Map. 
    Non-precision instrument runway means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only horizontal guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in non-precision instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned, and for which no precision approach facilities are planned or indicated on a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) planning document or the military service's military airport planning document. 
    Person means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, joint stock association, or governmental entity. It includes a trustee, receiver, assignee, or similar representative of any of them.

The width of the primary surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) for the most precise approach existing or planned for either end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
    Runway means a defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
    Tree means any object of natural growth. 
    Visual runway means a runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures, with no straight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on an FAA-approved airport layout plan, a military service approved military airport layout plan, or by any planning document submitted to the FAA by competent authority. 
(Code 1998, § 3-26; Ord. No. 2052, § 3-26, 12-2-2003) 
Sec. 7-37. - Airport zones. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal zones, and conical zones as they apply to a particular airport. Such zones are shown on the Sumter Airport Hazard Zoning Map. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Approach zone. The inner end of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide for runway 5/23. The approach zone for runway 5 expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. The approach zone for runway 23 has an inner width of 1,000 feet, an outer width of 16,000 feet, and a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the edge of the primary surface (200 feet from the runway threshold). The approach zones for runways 14 and 32 are the same dimensions and they begin at the edge of the primary surface which is the same as the runway threshold for a non-hard surface. The approach zones for runways 14 and 32 have an inner width of 250 feet, an outer width of 1,250 feet, and a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet. 
(2)  Transitional zones. These zones are hereby established as the area beneath the transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward beginning at the sides of the primary surface and extend at a slope of 7:1 to a height of 150 feet (332 feet above MSL) above airport elevation. The surface extends at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically (7:1) from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional zones for those portions of the precision approach zones which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is hereby established at 150 feet (332 feet above MSL) above airport elevation and defined by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
(4)  Conical zone. The conical zone is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet at a slope of 20:1 and to a height of 200 feet above the elevation of the horizontal zone. The conical zone does not include the precision instrument approach zones and the transitional zones. 
(Code 1998, § 3-27; Ord. No. 2052, § 3-27, 12-2-2003) 
Sec. 7-38. - Airport zone height limitations. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be maintained in any zone created by this article to the height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows when they lie within the city limits: 
(1)  Approach zone. Slopes upward 34 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline. 
(2)  Transitional zones. Slopes upward and outward seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach zones, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 332 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping upward and outward seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach zones, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. 150 feet above the airport elevation or a height of 332 feet above mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical zone. Slopes upward and outward 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation. 
(b)  Excepted height limitation . Nothing in this article shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to 35 feet above the surface of the land. 
(c)  Maximum height in the city shall not exceed 480 feet AGL except for radio and television antennas which should not exceed heights in the attachment to the ordinance from which this chapter was derived. Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. 
(Code 1998, § 3-28; Ord. No. 2052, § 3-28, 12-2-2003) 
Sec. 7-39. - Use restrictions. 
    Not withstanding any other provisions of this article, no use may be made to land or water within any zone established by this article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft using the airport. 
(Code 1998, § 3-29; Ord. No. 2052, § 3-29, 12-2-2003) 
Sec. 7-40. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulation not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Sumter Airport Commission to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Sumter Airport Commission. 
(Code 1998, § 3-30; Ord. No. 2052, § 3-30, 12-2-2003) 
Sec. 7-41. - Permits. 
(a)  Future uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted by the zoning administrator upon determination that no provisions of this section and this article are violated. 
(1)  However a permit for a tree or structure of less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway except when such a tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone. 
(2)  Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient particulars to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 60 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of appeals for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this article. 
(e)  Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the Sumter Airport Commission, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard.

(b)  Exception. This chapter shall not require a license for performance of any kind of construction, alteration, repair, or work upon any property by the owner thereof, or:

Such verification is to be accomplished by such means as deemed sufficient by the building official.

ARTICLE IV. - ACCOMMODATIONS FEE 

Sec. 22-132. - Findings. 
    It is hereby found and declared by the city council, the governing body of the City of Sumter, South Carolina: 
(1)  Tourism is becoming a major industry in the city. The city supports this major industry and has recently undertaken the creation and development of a tax increment financing district in the downtown area of the city in order to revitalize and redevelop the city and to attract tourists to the community. 
(2)  Moreover, as the tourist industry grows and expands, the city must make provision to increase certain municipal services in order to accommodate the needs of tourists who visit from time to time. 
(3)  The cost of providing the special services required by the tourism industry should be apportioned equitably between the city's residents and those who visit the city and enjoy the special benefits the city provides to them. It is necessary for the promotion of the common interests of the residents of the city as well as those who are visitors to the city to provide a method to alleviate the added financial burden on city resources in providing the services and improvements needed to support tourism and the resulting transient population. 
(4)  In order to raise the necessary sums to defray a portion of those added costs, it is appropriate to impose a charge, the receipts of which will pay costs related to: 
a.  The provision of municipal services which serve such visitors or tourists; and 
b.  Capital projects which not only enrich the city's residents but also contribute to the tourism industry. 
(5)  Cognizant of the need for municipalities to be given direct statutory authorization to raise moneys earmarked to defray such costs related to the tourism industry, the state general assembly adopted Act No. 138 during its 1997 session, now codified, in part, as sections 6-1-500 to 6-1-570 (the "Enabling Act") of the South Carolina Code of Laws of 1976, as amended (the "S.C. Code"). While the general assembly utilized the terms "accommodations tax" as a means by which to designate the charge authorized to be imposed upon transients, as such term is defined in the Enabling Act, it is the intent of city council to impose such charge as an accommodations fee pursuant to the provisions of this article. 
(6)  It is a well established principle of state law that the use of a particular term is not determinative of its characterization. See Jackson v. Breeland, 88 SE 128, 103 SC 184 (1915). As set forth in Brown v. County of Horry, 417 SE2d 565,308 SC 180 (1992), the factors that are of paramount importance to the analysis of whether a charge constitutes a tax or a fee are the following: 
a.  The purpose behind its imposition; 
b.  The intended portion of the community that will be charged; and 
c.  The dedication of the sums so collected to the purpose for which it is charged. 
(7)  City council finds that its actions in: 
a.  Imposing an accommodations fee upon those persons utilizing the accommodations service businesses; and 
b.  Segregating the collections received from such fees in order that such sums are used only for tourism related costs and expenditures authorized by the Enabling Act; 
meet the test enunciated in Brown such that the charges imposed pursuant to the provisions of this article constitute fees.

Sec. 22-133. - Authority. 
    This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority of title 5 of the S.C. Code, including, without limitation, S.C. Code 1976, § 5-7-10, and S.C.

(2)  This fee does not apply to any facility consisting of less than six sleeping rooms, contained on the same premises that is used as an individual's place of abode. 
(3)  The gross proceeds derived from the lease or rental of sleeping accommodations supplied to the same person for a period of 90 continuous days are not considered proceeds from transients. 
(Ord. No. 1767, § 4, 6-27-2000)

(a)  Payment of the fee established herein shall be the liability of the consumer of the services for items described in section 22-135. The fee shall be paid at the time of delivery of the services or items to which the fee applies and shall be collected by the provider or seller of the service, services or items. 
(b)  The fee collected by the seller or provider of services or items as required under section 22-135 shall be remitted to the city as follows:

(3)  On an annual basis when the amount of average collections is less than $25.00 a month (annual gross receipts less than $10,000.00). 
(c)  Total collections and required reports shall be submitted to the city by the 20th day of the month and shall cover sales for the previous month. Payments covered under the provisions of subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be submitted quarterly by January 20th, April 20th, July 20th and October 20th for the previous quarterly sales or annually by January 20th for the calendar year sales as provided in subsection (b)(3) of this section. Any collections not remitted by the above stated deadlines shall be subject to a penalty of five percent of the unpaid amount for each calendar month or portion thereof after the due date until paid. The failure to collect from patrons the amount imposed by this article shall not relieve any establishment subject to this article from making the required remittance. 
(d)  Any person violating this article shall be deemed guilty of an offense and shall be subject to punishment pursuant to this Code upon conviction. Each day of violation shall be considered a separate offense. Punishment for violation shall not relieve the offender of liability for delinquent amount, penalties, and costs provided for herein.

Chapter 42 - FLOODS 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 42-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code 1976, title 5, chapters 7, 23, and 25 (articles 5 and 7) and title 6, chapter 7, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the council of the City of Sumter, South Carolina does ordain as follows in this chapter. 
(Code 1998, § 100; Ord. No. 2459, § 100, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 42-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Code 1998, § 110; Ord. No. 2459, § 110, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 42-3. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
(a)  It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(b)  Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(c)  The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of this chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
(d)  Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs.

The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facility or infrastructure that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Such repairs may be taken successively and their cost counted cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of " Substantial improvement. " 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have been placed on the repetitive loss list, incurred substantial damage, or substantial improvement, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions (does not include American with Disabilities Act compliance standards); or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced.

(17)  The President issued Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management in May 1977. E.O 11988 directs federal agencies to assert a leadership role in reducing flood losses and losses to environmental values served by floodplains. Proposed developments must go through an eight-step review process. Evidence of compliance with the executive order must be submitted as part of the review process. 
(18)  Perform an assessment of damage from any origin to the structure using FEMA's residential substantial damage estimator (RSDE) software to determine if the damage equal or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(19)  Perform an assessment of permit applications for improvements or repairs to be made to a building or structure that equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction. Cost of work counted for determining if and when substantial improvements to a structure occur shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total cost associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether substantial improvements will occur. The market value shall be determined by one of the following methods: 
a.  The current assessed building value as determined by the county's assessor's office or the value of an appraisal performed by a licensed appraiser at the expense of the owner within the last six months. 
b.  One or more certified appraisals from a registered professional appraiser in accordance with state law.

(a)  Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit progresses, the local floodplain administrator shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the floodplain administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(b)  Stop work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this article, the floodplain administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor. 
(c)  Revocation of permits. The floodplain administrator and/or designee may revoke and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Development permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any development permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. 
(d)  Periodic inspections. The floodplain administrator and each member of his inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(e)  Violations to be corrected. When the floodplain administrator finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property. 
(f)  Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the floodplain administrator shall give written notice, by certified or registered mail to the last known address or by personal service, that: 
(1)  The building or property is in violation of this chapter. 
(2)  A hearing will be held before the floodplain administrator at a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter. 
(3)  Following the hearing, the floodplain administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears appropriate. 
(g)  Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the floodplain administrator shall find that the building or development is in violation of this chapter, shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such period, not less than 60 days. The floodplain administrator may prescribe; provided that where the floodplain administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. 
(h)  Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order to the board of appeals by giving notice of appeal in writing to the floodplain administrator and the clerk within ten days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the floodplain administrator shall be final. The board of appeals shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
(i)  Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished at the discretion of the court. 
(j)  Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared in violation of this article and after all penalties are exhausted to achieve compliance with this article, the local floodplain administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate a section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with the article. Once a violation has been remedied, the local floodplain administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the section 1316 be rescinded.

ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 42-63. - General standards. 
    Development may not occur in the special flood hazard area (SFHA) where alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a development permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures cannot be located out of the floodplain and that encroachments onto the SFHA are minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated August 2008, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(3)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages. 
(4)  Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood plus two feet. This requirement does not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses, etc., as long as cut-off devices and back flow devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to the building. 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(8)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure which is in compliance with the provisions of this article, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this article. This includes post-FIRM development and structures. 
(9)  Nonconforming buildings or uses. Nonconforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, nothing in this article shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter. 
(10)  American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in section 42-64, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(11)  Critical development shall be elevated to the 500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year flood elevation data. 
(12)  All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent flotation and lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads. 
(13)  Whenever any portion of the floodplain is used, the volume of space occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely to the watercourse. 
(14)  Parking and storage. The utilization of enclosed areas shall be the minimum necessary to allow for vehicle parking or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the use of the premises. 
(15)  Finished construction. The interior portion of enclosed areas below the first floor elevation shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(Code 1998, § 400; Ord. No. 2459, § 400, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 42-64. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 42-4 or 42-38(11) the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with subsection (5) of this section. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with subsection (5) of this section. No basements are permitted. Structures located in A Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 42-37(7) and (8). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 42-94. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of section 42-94 must meet the nonresidential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this article. Structures which are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The maintenance plan must be approved by the local floodplain administrator and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to same. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (3)a. of this section must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance with section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, effective date May 25, 1990, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis at least 36 inches or less above the grade at the sight, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required. 
d.  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within floodprone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local floodplain administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator. 
(4)  Recreational vehicles. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the requirements of sections 42-37 and 42-63 and subsection (3) of this section. 
(5)  Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
2.  The bottom of each opening must be no more than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening. 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
4.  Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building. 
5.  Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area. 
b.  Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized. 
c.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
d.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except to enclose a single storage area and must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required, and cannot be temperature controlled. One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in subsections (1) through (3) of this section. 
e.  All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in subsections (1) through (3) of this section shall be of flood resistant materials. 
(6)  Accessory structures. A detached accessory structure or garage, the cost of which is greater than $3,000.00, must comply with the requirements outlined in FEMA's Technical Bulletin 7-93, Wet Floodproofing Requirements , or be elevated in accordance with the requirements of subsections (1) and (5) of this section, or floodproofed in accordance with subsection (2) of this section. When accessory structures of $3,000.00 or less are to be placed in the floodplain, the following criteria shall be met: 
a.  Accessory structures shall not be used for any uses other than parking of vehicles and storage. 
b.  Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential. 
c.  Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters. 
d.  Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
e.  Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be installed in accordance with section 42-63(4). 
f.  Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be provided below base flood elevation in conformance with subsection (5)a. of this section. 
g.  Accessory structures shall be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Material Requirements, dated August 2008, available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable flood resistant materials. 
(7)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-4, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
1.  It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the floodplain administrator. 
2.  A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision must be obtained upon completion of the proposed development. 
b.  If subsection (7)a. of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
c.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection (3) of this section and the encroachment standards of subsection (7)a. of this section are met. 
e.  Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the floodway configuration. 
(8)  Fill. Fill is discouraged because storage capacity is removed from floodplains. Elevating buildings by other methods must be considered. An applicant shall demonstrate that fill is the only alternative to raising the building to at least two feet above the base flood elevation, and that the amount of fill used will not affect the flood storage capacity or adversely affect adjacent properties. The following provisions shall apply to all fill placed in the special flood hazard area: 
a.  Fill may not be placed in the floodway unless it is in accordance with subsection (7)a. of this section. 
b.  Fill may not be placed in tidal or nontidal wetlands without the required state and federal permits. 
c.  Fill must consist of soil and rock materials only. Dredged material may be used as fill only upon certification of suitability by a registered professional geotechnical engineer. Landfills, rubble fills, dumps, and sanitary fills are not permitted in the floodplain. 
d.  Fill used to support structures must comply with ASTM Standard D-698, and its suitability to support structures certified by a registered, professional engineer. 
e.  Fill slopes shall be no greater than two horizontal to one vertical. Flatter slopes may be required where velocities may result in erosion. 
f.  The use of fill shall not increase flooding or cause drainage problems on neighboring properties. 
g.  Fill will meet the requirements of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, Ensuring That Structures Built on Fill in or Near Special Flood Hazard Areas Are Reasonably Safe from Flooding. 
h.  New buildings must be constructed on properly designed and compacted fill that extends beyond the building walls before dropping below base flood elevation (BFE), and has the appropriate protection from erosion and scour. The design of the fill must be approved and certified in writing by a state-registered civil engineer. 
(9)  Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires that flood data be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures that flood maps, studies and other data identified in section 42-4 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data. The following map maintenance activities are identified: 
a.  Requirement to submit new technical data. 
1.  For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical or scientific data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA as soon as practicable, but no later than six months of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals include, but are not limited to: 
(i)  Floodway encroachment that increase or decrease base flood elevations or alter floodway boundaries; 
(ii)  Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area; 
(iii)  Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and 
(iv)  Subdivisions or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with section 42-65(2). 
2.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to have the technical data, required in accordance with subsection (9) of this section, prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall also be the responsibility of the applicant. 
3.  The local floodplain administrator shall require a conditional letter of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for: 
(i)  Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevations; and 
(ii)  Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway. 
4.  Floodplain development permits issued by the local floodplain administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (9) of this section. 
b.  Right to submit new technical data. The floodplain administrator may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations to base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate documentation made in writing by the local jurisdiction and may be submitted at any time. 
(10)  Swimming pools. All pools, both above ground and below ground, located within the flood fringe of the SFHA must be designed and constructed to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement under flood conditions. Pools are not allowed in a mapped regulatory floodway or in any other floodway as established by this article. And in no case shall pools be allowed within 25 feet of the top bank of any stream. 
(11)  Swimming pool utility equipment rooms. If the building cannot be built at or above the BFE because of functionality of the equipment, then a structure to house the utilities for the pool may be built below BFE with the following provisions: 
a.  Meet the requirements for accessory structures in subsection (6) of this section. 
b.  The utilities must be anchored to prevent flotation and be designed to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood. 
(12)  Elevators. 
a.  Install a float switch system or another system that provides the same level of safety necessary for all elevators where there is a potential for the elevator cab to descend below the BFE during a flood per FEMA's Technical Bulletin 4-93, Elevator Installation for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
b.  All equipment that may be installed below the BFE, such as counter weigh roller guides, compensation cable and pulleys, and oil buffers for traction elevators and the jack assembly for a hydraulic elevator, must be constructed using flood resistant materials where possible per FEMA's Technical Bulletin 4-93, Elevator Installation for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
(Code 1998, § 410; Ord. No. 2459, § 410, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 42-65. - Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-4, are small streams where no base flood data has been provided or where no floodways have been identified. The following provisions apply within such areas: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within 100 feet of the stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered, professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied and base flood elevation data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions of this article and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established in accordance with section 42-38(11). Data from preliminary, draft, and final flood insurance studies constitutes best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical Bulletin 1-98, Use of Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Data as Available Data. If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR chapter 1, parts 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used. When base flood elevation data is not available from a federal, state or other source, one of the following methods may be used to determine a BFE. For further information regarding the methods for determining base flood elevation listed below, refer to FEMA's manual, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas." 
a.  Contour interpolation. 
1.  Superimpose approximate Zone A boundaries onto a topographic map and estimate a BFE. 
2.  Add one-half of the contour interval of the topographic map that is used to the BFE. 
b.  Data extrapolation. A BFE can be determined if a site within 500 feet upstream of a stream reach for which a 100-year profile has been computed by detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope characteristics are relatively similar to the downstream reaches. No hydraulic structures shall be present. 
c.  Hydrologic and hydraulic calculations. Perform hydrologic and hydraulic calculations to determine base flood elevation using FEMA-approved methods and software. 
(3)  In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data are not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates base flood elevation for all subdivision proposals and other proposed developments containing at least 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less. 
(Ord. No. 2459, § 420, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 42-66. - Standards for subdivision proposals and other development. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(b)  All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall have adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood damage. 
(c)  The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data to FEMA in section 42-64(9) when a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis is completed that generates base flood elevations. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and are subject to all applicable standards in these regulations. 
(Code 1998, § 430; Ord. No. 2459, § 430, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 42-67. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-4, are areas designated as shallow flooding. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor elevated at least as high as the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade; 
b.  Be completely floodproofed together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in section 42-38; 
c.  Structures constructed on slopes are required to have drainage paths around the structure to guide water away from the structure.

Sec. 42-94. - Agricultural structures. 
    Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure, provided it is used solely for agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure must meet all of the conditions and considerations of section 42-98, this section, and the following standards: 
(1)  Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed below: 
a.  Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for the storage of farm machinery and equipment; 
b.  Steel grain bins and steel frame corn cribs; 
c.  General purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock which are open on at least one side; 
d.  For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be issued for structures which were substantially damaged. New construction or substantial improvement of such structures must meet the elevation requirements of section 42-64(2); and 
e.  Detached garages and storage sheds solely used for parking and limited storage in connection with agricultural uses only, which are no greater than 400 square feet in area. 
(2)  The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an existing building which is substantially damaged, with flood resistant materials for the exterior and interior building components and elements below the base flood elevation; 
(3)  The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood velocities exceed five feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls; 
(4)  The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of section 42-64(5); 
(5)  Any mechanical, electrical or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure which is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions. The structure must comply with section 42-63(4); 
(6)  The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of section 42-64(7)a.; and 
(7)  Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain.

    In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(9)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and 
(10)  Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available.

Sec. 42-98. - Floodways. 
    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to the issuance of the variance.

    Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. The following conditions shall apply to all variances: 
(1)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  The local floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this article. Violations must be corrected in accordance with section 42-39(5).

--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2542, § 1, adopted April 5, 2016, did not specifically amend the Code. Therefore, such ordinance has been added as §§ 66-41-66-45 at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 66-41. - Development and implementation of standards and policies. 
(a)  In addition to the initial standards and policies approved herein, the council intends to develop additional standards and policies to be applied to new commercial and residential development within the city and its surrounding areas. Such standards and policies may address, without limitation, annexation, provision of utilities, payment of development fees, acceptance of dedicated property, maintenance covenants, financial support, and other related matters. The standards and policies shall be approved by ordinance as the council deems prudent. The standards and policies so developed shall be assembled in an indexed fashion and shall be retained in a central location, available for public review, by the city clerk. 
(b)  The city manager of the city is hereby authorized to establish procedural, explanatory, technical, and ministerial rules and guidelines to carry out the intent and purposes of the standards and policies approved by the council. Such rules and guidelines need not be approved by council, but must be reported to council prior to their effectiveness. 
(c)  The rules and guidelines established by the city manager shall be subject to and controlled by such standards and policies as may be approved by the council, including those set forth herein. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the rules and guidelines established by the city manager and the expressed will of the council (whether contained in an ordinance, resolution, voice vote, council minutes, or any other official expression of council's will), the act of council shall take precedence. 
(Ord. No. 2542, § 1, 4-5-2016) 
Sec. 66-42. - Provision of utility service. 
(a)  The city will generally adhere to a policy of requiring new development to pay all costs incurred in connecting to the city's existing water and sewer system. The specific provisions in this section 66-42 shall be read in light of this general policy. The provisions of this section 66-42 shall apply to residential and commercial development only. Water and/or sewer service may be provided to industrial customers (whether inside the municipal limits of the city or not) on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the city manager and approved by the council. 
(b)  The owners and/or developers of all new developments shall be responsible, at no cost to the city, for the installation of service taps in accordance with the city's specifications. Unless there is a written agreement to contrary, signed by the city manager and approved by the council, the city will not pay any "tap reimbursements" or other amounts calculated by reference to the cost of obtaining utility service. 
(c)  The owners and/or developers of all new developments shall be responsible, at no cost to the city, for the costs of extending existing city water and sewer lines to connect such developments to the city's existing water and sewer system. Such costs shall be deemed to include not only the installation of new lines, but also the upsizing of any existing lines that may be required to deliver safe and efficacious water and/or sewer service. 
(d)  The city will generally provide combined water and sewer service to locations within the municipal limits of the city pursuant to a generally applicable rate schedule. The city may elect, however, not to provide water and/or sewer service to certain locations within the municipal limits of the city if constrained by treatment or transmission capacity, or if service is otherwise commercially impracticable. 
(e)  The city may, in its discretion, provide combined water and sewer service to locations outside the municipal limits of the city. As a condition of providing such water and sewer service, the city may require annexation prior to connection or commencement of service. In any event, even if the city does not require prior annexation, such service will be provided only if the customer executes and delivers an enforceable agreement to be annexed into the city upon the city's request. The agreement shall clearly express that the city has no obligation to annex such property at any particular time, but instead shall retain the discretion to annex such property at the most advantageous time. The annexation agreement shall also require that any proposed development at the service location conform to the city's planning and zoning standards, rules, and processes. This agreement must be recorded in the chain of title for the served property in order to bind successor purchasers. 
(f)  The city may, in its discretion, provide water-only service to new development within the municipal limits of the city pursuant to a generally applicable rate schedule. Unless otherwise approved by council, the city will not provide sewer-only service to new development within the municipal limits of the city. For purposes of this paragraph, "new development" means commercial or residential service locations that do not have a certificate of occupancy or a utility availability letter from the city as of the effective date of this article. 
(g)  Other than for industrial customers, unless otherwise approved by council, the city will not provide water-only or sewer-only service to locations outside the municipal limits of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2542, § 1, 4-5-2016) 
Sec. 66-43. - Dedication and acceptance; maintenance agreements. 
(a)  The city will accept dedication of property or infrastructure from a developer only on the following conditions: (i) the property or infrastructure must be in a condition acceptable to the city, and if applicable shall have been designed and engineered to the city's standards; (ii) the documents and agreements pursuant to which the dedication is accomplished shall describe with specificity the exact property or infrastructure to be conveyed, and shall specifically exclude or include (as the case may be) related or appurtenant property and infrastructure; and (iii) the grantor of such property or infrastructure shall be required to make appropriate representations, warranties, covenants, and undertakings as may be acceptable to and required by the city manager in his sole discretion. 
(b)  The city will not accept any dedication of property or infrastructure without an accompanying maintenance agreement requiring the grantor to maintain the dedicated property or infrastructure for a period of not less than two years from the date of dedication. The property or infrastructure subject to the maintenance agreement shall be exactly identical in nature and scope to the dedicated property or infrastructure. Such maintenance agreement shall be supported by a letter of credit guaranteeing payment in the amount required by the city's zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2542, § 1, 4-5-2016) 
Sec. 66-44. - Annexation. 
(a)  Annexation into the city shall not be as of right. Prior to the city's approval of any annexation of any new residential or commercial development, the city staff may prepare a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed annexation. The form of the analysis may be established by the city manager, but it must at a minimum project the additional costs to the city, and the offsetting additional revenues, resulting from the annexation. 
(b)  To the extent practicable, the city may time annexations in a manner that minimizes the initial costs to the city of accepting such annexations. For example, the city manager is authorized to actively seek to minimize the period of time between the date of the annexation and the date that the first tax payments with respect to the annexed property will be received by the city. Therefore, the city will generally accept annexations on or immediately prior to the last day on which properties may be added to the next succeeding annual tax bill. The city manager may also consider the costs of utility, fire, police, and other municipal services in determining a prudent time for the completion of new annexations. 
(Ord. No. 2542, § 4, 4-5-2016) 
Sec. 66-45. - Council approval. 
    The standards and policies established pursuant to this article (whether contained herein or subsequently established by the city manager) shall be treated as prudential guidelines, and not as enforceable rules or laws. Therefore, no private citizen shall have a right to enforce such standards and policies, and the council may by affirmative action override such standards and policies on a case-by-case basis.

(c)  The city council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
(2)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
(d)  Adoption. The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

(1)  Type 1 stormwater management and sediment control plans shall be submitted for all land disturbing activities with disturbed areas of one acre or greater. Type 1 plans shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 82-135. 
(2)  Type 2 stormwater management and sediment control plans shall be submitted for all land disturbing activities less than one acre which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale. A Type 2 plan shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 82-136. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 3.7, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-63. - Approval or disapproval of application. 
(a)  Specific requirements of the permit application and approval process are generally based on the extent of the land disturbing activity. The permit application and approval procedure is as follows: 
(1)  For land disturbing activities involving less than one acre of actual land disturbance which are not part of a larger common sale, the person responsible for the land disturbing activity shall submit a Type 2 stormwater management and sediment control plan. This plan does not require preparation or certification by the designers specified in section 82-157(b). 
(2)  For land disturbing activities disturbing one acre or more, a Type 1 stormwater management and sediment control plan is required. However, the use of measures other than ponds to achieve water quality improvements are recommended on sites containing less than ten disturbed acres. Plans and specifications for these activities will be prepared by the designers specified in section 82-157(b). Upon receipt of a completed application for sediment and stormwater management, the appropriate plan approval agency shall accomplish its review and have either the approval or review comments transmitted to the applicant within 20 working days. If notice is not given to the applicant or if action is not taken by the end of the 20-day working period, the applicant's plan will be considered approved. 
(3)  These requirements may be modified on a case-by-case basis to address specific stormwater quantity or quality problems or other regulatory requirements. Requests for waivers or variances from these requirements will be made in accordance with the provisions of sections 82-58 and 82-59. 
(4)  When the land disturbing activity consists of the construction of a pond, lake or reservoir which is singly built and not part of a permitted land disturbing activity, the following procedures will apply: 
a.  A stormwater management and sediment control plan will not be required if the pond, lake or reservoir is permitted under the S.C. Dams and Reservoirs Safety Act or has received certificate of exemption from the S.C. Dams and Reservoirs Act. Best management practices should be used to minimize the impact of erosion and sediment. 
b.  A stormwater management and sediment control plan will be required for the construction of all ponds, lakes or reservoirs not meeting the conditions in this article that otherwise meet the size requirements for stormwater management and sediment control plan approval. 
(b)  A stormwater management and sediment control plan or an application for a waiver shall be submitted to the appropriate plan approval agency by the person responsible for the land disturbing activity for review and approval for a land disturbing activity, unless otherwise exempted. The stormwater management and sediment control plan shall contain supporting computations, drawings, and sufficient information describing the manner, location, and type of measures in which stormwater runoff will be managed from the entire land disturbing activity. The appropriate plan approval agency shall review the plan to determine compliance with the requirements of these regulations prior to approval. The approved stormwater management and sediment control plan shall serve as the basis for water quantity and water quality control on all subsequent construction. 
(c)  All stormwater management and sediment control plans submitted for approval shall contain certification by the person responsible for the land disturbing activity that the land disturbing activity will be accomplished pursuant to the approved plan and that responsible personnel will be assigned to the project. 
(d)  All stormwater management and sediment control plans shall contain certification by the person responsible for the land disturbing activity of the right of the commission or implementing agency to conduct on-site inspections. 
(e)  The stormwater and sediment management plan shall not be considered approved without the inclusion of an approval stamp with a signature and date on the plans by the appropriate plan approval agency. The stamp of approval on the plans is solely an acknowledgement of satisfactory compliance with the requirements of these regulations. The approval stamp does not constitute a representation or warranty to the applicant or any other person concerning the safety, appropriateness or effectiveness of any provision, or omission from the stormwater and sediment plan. 
(f)  Approved plans remain valid for five years from the date of an approval. Extensions or renewals of the plan approvals will be granted by the plan approval agency upon written request by the person responsible for the land disturbing activity. 
(g)  Approvals of land disturbing activities which were approved by the commission or its designee prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall remain in effect for the original term of the approval. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 3.8, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-64. - Other authorization or requirement. 
    Where any authorization, bonds, permits or other securities are required by applicable federal, state or local laws, regulations or ordinances for any part of the proposed work to be done under the plan, the applicant shall, upon request, furnish the city with satisfactory evidence that such requirements have been met before the commencement of work under an approved application. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 3.9, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-65. - Extension of time. 
    If the applicant is unable to complete the work within the time specified in the approved plan and grading permit, he may, prior to the expiration of such time, present in writing a request for an extension of time, setting forth the reasons for the requested extension.

Secs. 82-68-82-92. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - AUTHORIZATION FOR DISCHARGES OF STORMWATER FROM CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY 

Sec. 82-93. - Operator requirements. 
    Construction site operators must complete, and submit to the city, the appropriate NOI form as specified below to receive coverage under the NPDES general permit for stormwater discharges from construction activities as regulated by SCDHEC. The term "operator" means any person associated with a construction project who meets one of the following two criteria: 
(1)  The person has operational control over construction plans, SWPPPs, and specifications, including the ability to request modifications to those plans, SWPPPs, and specifications by a qualified individual identified in section 82-157(b). This person is typically the owner or developer of the project or a portion of the project (subsequent builders), and is considered the primary permittee; or 
(2)  The person has day-to-day operational control of those activities at a construction site, which are necessary to ensure compliance with a SWPPP for the construction site or other permit conditions. This person is often referred to as the operator of day-to-day site activities (ODSA) and is typically a contractor or a residential builder who is hired by the primary permittee. This person is considered a secondary permittee for a residential development. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 4.1, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-94. - Operator categories. 
(a)  Primary permittee. 
(1)  An owner, developer or operator of a project is a primary permittee. This person may include, but is not limited to a developer, landowner, realtor, builder, utility provider, public or private entity, etc. The primary permittee's responsibility to comply with requirements of the permit extends until coverage is terminated in accordance with requirements of article IX of this chapter. The primary permittee must submit a complete and accurate NOI as described in section 82-98. The primary permittee may rely on, or require, secondary permittees and/or contractors to assist with project activities necessary to ensure compliance with the permit and implementation of the OS-SWPPP. 
(2)  The primary permittee on any construction site subject to the permit is responsible for preparation of the site-specific C-SWPPP as described in article VI of this chapter. 
(3)  The primary permittee on any construction site shall either enforce compliance with the approved, site-specific OS-SWPPP or report activities, which are not in compliance with the OS-SWPPP, to the city when a secondary permittee fails to implement the appropriate BMPs or other measures as outlined by the OS-SWPPP or alternate permit conditions. 
(b)  Secondary permittees. 
(1)  An individual lot owner or residential builder that conducts land disturbing activity at a construction site, that is limited to an individual lot or a group of lots that are part of a LCP previously approved by the city, is a secondary permittee. 
(2)  Residential subdivisions; individual and/or multiple lots: 
a.  Individual lots or a collection of individual lots within a residential subdivision that are part of a larger common plan (LCP) are regulated regardless of lot size or ownership. If the primary permittee obtains coverage under the permit for the development and then sells lots within the development, then coverage under the permit may either continue with the primary permittee or the primary permittee may require that the new lot owner (or new lot owner may choose to) obtain their own coverage under the permit as a secondary permittee. The primary permittee must inform the new owner of the individual lot notice of intent requirements and make the OS-SWPPP and a copy of the CGP available to the new owner who would be seeking individual lot coverage under the permit. When a secondary permittee elects to not follow the drainage provisions in the primary permittee's approved OS-SWPPP, the city may require the secondary permittee to request coverage under the permit as a primary permittee. 
b.  Each individual lot owner or residential builder obtaining their own coverage under the permit will be issued a new NPDES permit coverage number and assigned a state file number linked to the LCP by SCDHEC. 
c.  For projects covered under the 2006 CGP and where an individual lot owner or residential builder has signed a co-permittee agreement, those individual lot owners or residential builders may continue to work under that agreement as a co-permittee as long as the project's coverage remains active and under the control of the operator to whom coverage was originally granted. 
(3)  Lot owners obtaining their own coverage under the permit shall: 
a.  Complete, and submit to the city, an individual lot notice of intent (IL-NOI) meeting the requirements set forth in section 82-98(c) at least seven business days prior to the commencement of construction activities by the secondary permittee at the site. 
b.  Indicate on the NOI that the new lot owner will follow the approved on-site SWPPP (OS-SWPPP) and individual lot controls developed for the LCP or develop a sediment and erosion control plan meeting the requirements set forth for a comprehensive SWPPP (C-SWPPP) in section 82-156(g). 
c.  Individual lot owners and residential builders with multiple lots within an LCP may submit only one individual lot NOI for coverage under the permit. 
(4)  Contractors. 
a.  Contractors employed by the primary or secondary permittee, whose work at a construction site may disturb soils or whose work may otherwise be necessary to implement the approved on-site SWPPP (OS-SWPPP), must complete a project-specific contractor certification form meeting the requirements set forth in section 82-98(c). Each contractor must also attend and document attendance at a pre-construction conference as defined in sections 82-96 and 82-195. All contractors and subcontractors identified in the plan to perform construction related work intended to disturb soils at the site that may affect the implementation of the SWPPP must sign the certification statement given below: 
"I certify by my signature below that: 
1. I or I on behalf of my company, as the case may be, participated in a pre-construction conference on-site or, when allowed, offsite with the individual who is responsible for the operational control of the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) or the duly authorized representative, and/or the preparer of the SWPPP or person with registration equivalent to that of the preparer of the SWPPP; and 
2. I or I on behalf of my company accept the terms and conditions of the SWPPP as it pertains to the portion or portions of the plan I or my company am responsible for, and as required by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Construction Activities permit SCR100000 issued to the Owner/Operator of the construction activity for which I or my company have been contracted to perform construction related professional services. I understand that I, and my company, as the case may be, may be legally accountable to the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) and/or the local implementing authority (City of Sumter), under the authorities of the CWA and the S.C. Pollution Control Act, to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the SWPPP." 
b.  This form is to be submitted to the primary permittee or secondary permittee (as applicable) prior to commencement of construction activities and is to be retained with the approved OS-SWPPP at the site. Contractors are responsible for ensuring that their activity is in compliance with the approved OS-SWPPP and other permit conditions. 
c.  The date of the signature, the title of the person providing the signature, and the name, address, and telephone number and employer identification number (EIN) of the contracted firm, shall also be provided. In the event the primary permittee amends the SWPPP, such amendments should be incorporated to the plan and the contractors and subcontractors should acknowledge by signature. Contractors who have completed their work prior to the amendments do not have to sign the amendments. 
d.  All contractors are subject to SCDHEC and city enforcement actions if permit conditions are not met. Enforcement actions may be taken against any specific contractor or combination of contractors, with consideration given to the party responsible for the violation. The primary permittee submitting the NOI shall retain all contractor certifications for at least three years after a contractor has completed work at the site. Contractors who sign the certification may be liable to SCDHEC or city enforcement actions related to their work at the site. All certifications must be included in the SWPPP. 
e.  Copies of all contractor certifications and a copy of this permit shall be kept with the SWPPP. If additional contractors are added later on, the original and one copy of the additional contractor certifications must be submitted along with the monthly reports or copies of the inspection forms submitted after the signing of the certification. For construction sites that disturb less than ten acres, the primary permittee of the facility covered by this permit shall make all contractor certifications available to SCDHEC and the city upon request. The department and/or city may on a case-by-case basis require the submittal of the contractor certifications. 
(5)  Utility providers and utility contractors. Utility providers and utility contractors that are responsible, either directly or indirectly, for the construction, installation, and maintenance of conduits, pipes, pipelines, cables, wires, trenches, vaults, manholes, and similar structures or devices for the conveyance of natural gas (or other types of gas), liquid petroleum products, electricity, telecommunications (telephone, data, television, etc.), water or sewage are required to complete a contractor certification form or as an alternative, may submit an annual blanket notice of intent (AB-NOI) to SCDHEC. Utility operators shall submit their AB-NOI approved by SCDHEC to the city prior to the commencement of site activities. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 4.2, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-95. - Previously permitted projects. 
    For projects covered under the 2006 CGP and where a contractor has signed a co-permittee agreement as required by that permit, those contractors may continue to work under that agreement as a co-permittee as long as that project's coverage remains active and under the control of the permittee to whom coverage was originally granted.

(Ord. No. 2469, § 4.7, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-100. - Submission deadlines. 
(a)  Deadlines. Deadlines for submission of an initial or a modified notice of intent application and other required information are defined below for new and ongoing projects. A "new project" is defined as one that commenced construction after January 1, 2013. An "ongoing project" is one that commenced construction before January 1, 2013. 
(b)  New projects. 
(1)  To obtain coverage under the permit, the applicant must submit a complete and accurate NOI and other information required in section 82-99 to the city prior to commencement of construction activities. Land disturbing activities may not commence until written approval is granted by SCDHEC. 
(c)  Permitted ongoing projects. 
(1)  If the applicant previously received authorization to discharge for the current phase of their project under the 2006 CGP, they shall be granted coverage under the permit as long as the construction site complies with the SWPPP requirements of article VI of this chapter. There will be no additional fees associated with an extension of coverage for existing sites under the permit. However, the city may, at its discretion, require an applicant to confirm their intent to be covered under the permit following its effective date. 
(2)  For projects covered under the 2006 CGP, any individual or group that has signed a co-permittee agreement may continue to conduct work as a co-permittee as long as the project's coverage remains active and under the control of the operator to whom coverage was originally granted. 
(d)  New owner/operator of ongoing projects. 
(1)  Where the operator changes (new owner), after the initial NOI and comprehensive SWPPP (C-SWPPP) have been approved, the city must be notified in writing within seven calendar days. Accompanying this notification, the new operator must submit one of the following: 
a.  A new NOI and C-SWPPP, when the new operator does not agree to comply with the approved C-SWPPP and/or elects to modify the approved C-SWPPP; or 
b.  A new NOI and compliance statement, when the new operator agrees to comply with the approved C-SWPPP. Note that the C-SWPPP must still be updated, if not already completed, in compliance with section 82-156(g). 
The new operator may not commence work at the construction site until approved by the city and SCDHEC. The new NOI and C-SWPPP must reference the project's name and tracking number assigned to the initial operator's NOI and C- SWPPP. 
(2)  If the construction site under the control of the new owner is inactive and all areas disturbed have reached stabilization, the NOI may not need to be submitted immediately. Written notification to the city should: 
a.  Identify both the previous owner and new owner that will obtain operational control at a construction site; 
b.  Identify the construction site as inactive; 
c.  Identify each project area and the stabilization status (either as temporary stabilization or final stabilization); 
d.  Provide a detailed explanation for delayed commencement of construction at the construction site under the direction of the new owner and proposed plans, schedule, dates, etc., for recommencement under the new owner; and 
e.  A NOI will need to be submitted before any additional construction activities are to be implemented at the construction site. 
(3)  If the site under the control of the new owner is inactive and all areas disturbed have not reached stabilization, the new owner must obtain permit coverage and provide stabilization as defined in article II of this chapter. Stabilization measures may be implemented prior to issuance of new permit coverage. 
(4)  If the new owner or operator has elected to modify the layout of the construction site, thereby altering the approved comprehensive SWPPP, then the new owner or operator must apply for new coverage under the permit. 
(5)  If upon the sale or transfer of the construction site's ownership does not change the signatory requirements for the NOI, but the site's owner or developer's company name has changed, an updated NOI should be submitted to the city along with written notification defining the proposed sale or transfer of ownership. If the new operator agrees to comply with an existing comprehensive SWPPP already implemented at the site, a SWPPP acceptance and compliance statement should be included in the notification to the city. If the new operator does not agree to comply with an existing C-SWPPP, a new C-SWPPP must be submitted with the NOI to apply for new coverage under the permit. 
(6)  Each new owner/operator will be subject to the standard NPDES permit coverage fee of $125.00 for construction sites. There will be no additional review fees associated with the sale or transfer of ownership for existing permitted construction sites when no major modifications to an SWPPP occurs. 
(7)  If the transfer of ownership is due to foreclosure or a permittee filing for bankruptcy proceedings, see section 82-97. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 4.8, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-101. - Late notifications. 
    NOIs submitted after initiating clearing, grading, filling and excavation activities (including borrow pits and stockpile material storage areas), or other similar construction activities for projects or sites required to obtain authorization under the permit are considered late. When a late NOI is submitted, authorization for discharges occurs consistent with section 82-103. The city or SCDHEC may take enforcement for any un-permitted discharge or violations of laws or regulations that occur between the time construction commenced and discharge authorization. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 4.9, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-102. - Where to submit. 
    The applicant must send a complete and accurate NOI application to the city. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 4.10, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-103. - Authorization to discharge. 
(a)  Authorization to discharge shall be granted by SCDHEC within seven business days of SCDHEC receipt of NOI, submittal review fees and written approval from the city. 
(b)  If SCDHEC does not send a letter authorizing coverage, denying coverage, providing review comments, or advising that a review of the C-SWPPP will take place, the authorization to discharge will be automatically granted. 
(c)  If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' 404 permit or SCDHEC 401 water quality certification is required by section 404 or 401 of the CWA for permanent or temporary stormwater control structures, SCDHEC may not grant the applicant coverage under the permit until the 404 and 401 permits have been issued and are effective. 
(d)  In situations where the 404 permit decision will not affect the implementation of a SWPPP, SCDHEC will issue approval of the SWPPP and grant coverage under the permit before the 404 permit decision is effective. 
(e)  In situations where the 404 permit decision will affect only a portion of the project area, the city may grant the unaffected portion of the project area coverage under the permit. The remaining portion of the project area will be considered after the 404 permit is issued and effective. 
(f)  In situations where the entire project area is affected by the 404 permit decision, the department will not grant coverage under this general permit until the 404 permit decision is issued and effective. 
(g)  When permanent or temporary structures will be placed in state navigable waters, the department will address any issues related to state navigable waters' program under S.C. Code Reg. 19-450 during the review of the C-SWPPP rather than requiring a separate state navigable waters permit. This provision will only apply to activities that will not require a 404 permit or a 401 certification.

ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLANS 

Sec. 82-156. - General information. 
(a)  A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) is a requirement for coverage under the NPDES permit. The applicant shall submit a complete comprehensive SWPPP (C-SWPPP) as defined in subsection (g) of this section for city and SCDHEC review and approval. After C-SWPPP approval, a condensed version of the C-SWPPP labeled as the on-site SWPPP (OS-SWPPP), as defined in subsection (h) of this section must be kept at the construction site until final stabilization is reached and coverage under the permit has been terminated. 
(b)  At least one C-SWPPP must be developed for each construction site seeking coverage under the permit and a qualified individual, when applicable, as defined by section 82-157(b), in accordance with good engineering practices (GEP) must prepare the C-SWPPP. 
(c)  The C-SWPPP must be submitted with the NOI for the application to be deemed complete. 
(d)  The C-SWPPP is to be consistent, at a minimum, to the standards listed in S.C. Code Reg. 72-300, unless specifically exempted by S.C. Code Reg. 72-302.A. 
(e)  The comprehensive stormwater pollution prevention plan (C-SWPPP) must: 
(1)  Be site-specific; 
(2)  Identify all potential sources of pollution which may reasonably be expected to affect the quality of stormwater discharges from the construction site; 
(3)  Describe practices to be used to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharges from the construction site; 
(4)  Ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit when properly implemented; and 
(5)  If the C-SWPPP must be prepared by an individual identified in section 82-157(b), the C-SWPPP must contain the following certification: 
a.  "I have placed my signature and seal on the design documents submitted signifying that I accept responsibility for the design of the system. Further, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the design is consistent with the requirements of Title 48, Chapter 14 of the S.C. Code 1976 as amended, pursuant to S.C. Code Reg. 72-300 et seq. (if applicable), and in accordance with the terms and conditions of SCR100000." 
(f)  The permittee must implement the approved C-SWPPP at the construction site as written from commencement of construction activities until final stabilization has been reached. The approved, C-SWPPP to be implemented will be a condensed version, as defined in subsection (h) of this section, and will be labeled as the on-site SWPPP (OS-SWPPP). 
(g)  Comprehensive SWPPPs. 
(1)  Each comprehensive SWPPP (C-SWPPP) must be designed, approved, and implemented to meet all applicable requirements outlined by the permit. A C-SWPPP is to accompany the notice of intent when the permittee is seeking coverage under the permit. The C-SWPPP is to include all applicable items outlined in section 82-163. Once approved, the C-SWPPP will be condensed into the on-site SWPPP, as outlined in subsection (h) of this section, before undergoing implementation. The construction site plans are referenced as part of the contents of a C-SWPPP but do not have to be bound to the C-SWPPP. The construction site plans should be submitted as a separate document. 
(2)  For nonlinear construction sites disturbing more than five acres, the comprehensive SWPPP must be submitted with a phased erosion prevention and sediment control plan in accordance with section 82-163(i)(2). 
(3)  For any C-SWPPPs associated with a larger common plan (LCP), specifically associated with residential development, the C-SWPPP must be designed in a manner that the entire project site, during construction and through final build out, is in compliance with the requirements herein. A C-SWPPP designed to the above conditions will allow secondary permittees to apply for individual lot coverage under the NPDES permit by referencing and implementing the approved OS-SWPPP. 
(h)  On-site SWPPPs. 
(1)  An on-site SWPPP is a derivative of the comprehensive SWPPP and is created after the C-SWPPP has been submitted to and approved by the city and SCDHEC. Once the on-site SWPPP is created from the approved C-SWPPP, it is to be stored at the construction site as required by section 82-161. 
(2)  The on-site SWPPP must include the same stormwater management and sediment control plan, and the same construction site plans included in the comprehensive SWPPP approved for the site. 
(3)  Each on-site SWPPP will act as the construction site's living documentation that will be followed as the stormwater pollution prevention plan is implemented, updated as modifications are made, and used as a record log as stages of the approved OS-SWPPP are completed until the construction site has reached final stabilization and coverage under the permit has been terminated. 
(4)  The contents of the on-site SWPPP include all items required for the review and approval of the C-SWPPP under section 82-163 except for engineering reports, section 82-163(h). 
(5)  The contents of the on-site SWPPP must also include the following additional documents which may not be required to be a part of the C-SWPPP prior to approval: 
a.  SCDHEC construction general permit. One copy of the permit, excluding the appendices. Provisions may be made for the copy of general permit to be accessed electronically as long as a hard copy can be made available by the end of the working day when required. 
b.  Notice of intent. A stamped and approved copy of the NOI. 
c.  NPDES coverage approval letter. The letter generated once the C-SWPPP is determined to be in compliance with the permit. 
d.  City approval. Any additional letters, approvals, or certifications necessary to implement the OS-SWPPP, when necessary. 
e.  USACOE approvals. Certifications necessary to allow impacts to waters of the state or jurisdictional wetlands, when necessary. 
f.  Contractor certifications. Certifications necessary to allow contractors to conduct construction activities within the construction site. 
g.  Recordkeeping. Any logs necessary to track the progress, compliance, modifications and those associated with the construction site. These logs may include, but are not limited to, a pre-construction conference log, an inspection log, a stabilization log, a rain log, a contractor log and/or any additional recordkeeping as deemed necessary by the permittee, contractor, SCDHEC or the city.

(Ord. No. 2469, § 6.4, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-160. - Reviews and approvals. 
(a)  The C-SWPPP is required to be submitted for review and approved by the city and SCDHEC before construction activities may commence. 
(b)  Any major modification, as referenced in section 82-162(c), to any SWPPP is required to be submitted to and approved by the city and SCDHEC before implementation of any major modifications may commence. 
(c)  Minor modifications, as referenced in section 82-162(d), may be made to any SWPPP by the permittee without approval. However, these modifications must be recorded in the on-site SWPPP and be made available upon request by the city or SCDHEC. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 6.5, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-161. - Availability. 
(a)  A copy of the OS-SWPPP, as defined by section 82-156(h), must be retained at the construction site or a nearby location easily accessible during normal business hours, from the date of commencement of construction activities to the date that final stabilization is reached. 
(b)  If a location within the construction site is unavailable to store the on-site SWPPP when no personnel are present, notice of the plan's location, along with any updated contact information, must be posted near the main entrance at the construction site. 
(c)  Contractors and/or builders, who have day-to-day operational control over OS-SWPPP implementation, must have a copy of this SWPPP available at a central location within the construction site for the use by all those identified as having responsibilities under the OS-SWPPP. 
(d)  For linear construction of roads and utilities (i.e., electrical power lines, gas lines, main sewer trunk lines, and water distribution lines), which are not part of a LCP, where it is not practical to have the OS-SWPPP on location, the permittee and/or operator must upon request make the OS-SWPPP available by the end of normal business hours, or by the following business day under extenuating circumstances. 
(e)  On-site SWPPPs must be made available upon request and at the time of a construction site inspection by EPA, SCDHEC or city representatives. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 6.6, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-162. - Modifications. 
(a)  Each SWPPP must be modified if during inspections or investigations by city, state or federal officials, it is determined that any SWPPP is ineffective in either eliminating, when reasonably possible, or significantly minimizing pollutants in stormwater discharges from the construction site. 
(b)  Each SWPPP must be modified as necessary to include additional or modified BMPs, which are designed to correct problems identified during the construction site inspection by any qualified inspector, as identified in section 82-196(e), or by city, state or federal officials. Revisions to each SWPPP must be completed within seven calendar days following the inspection. Implementation of these additional or modified BMPs must be accomplished as described in section 82-163(f). 
(c)  Major modifications. Each SWPPP must be modified and submitted for review and approval by the city and SCDHEC if any of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  Whenever there is a significant change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance at the construction site resulting in discharges that will cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to violations to the state's water quality standards. 
(2)  Whenever a change in the design, construction, operation, or maintenance calls for a revision of any approved SWPPP based on the following list of modifications: 
a.  Modifications that will affect the hydrology or trapping efficiency calculations including: 
1.  Resizing sediment or detention basins to meet flow or volume requirements of a site redesign. 
2.  Deletion of sediment or detention basin or sediment trap. 
3.  Relocation of sediment or detention basins resulting in increases/decreases in receiving drainage area and/or resulting in a new/relocated basin outlet location, which is directed towards an outfall that was not approved within the C-SWPPP. 
4.  Addition/removal of sediment or detention basin. 
5.  Modification of sediment or detention basin outlet structure. 
6.  Changes in grading that alter drainage patterns that may result in increased or decreased flow to a sediment or detention basin. 
7.  Amending construction sequence in a fashion that the detention basin is not installed before grubbing operations begin. 
b.  Point discharge or outfall location changes. 
c.  Any modification to regulated water quality structural control measures. 
d.  Adding a new point discharge. 
e.  Addition of impervious area due to revised site development plans.

g.  Changes to navigable water crossing. 
h.  Addition of sediment trap when required to obtain 80 percent trapping efficiencies for disturbed areas not previously permitted or redirected away from an approved water quality BMP. 
i.  Site layout changes that require redesigning the stormwater management system. 
j.  Any additional modifications as determined by the city or SCDHEC. 
(d)  Minor modifications. The permittee must modify the on-site SWPPP and keep a record of each modification within the on-site SWPPP if any of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  Addition of BMPs. Addition of silt fence, slope drains, inlet protection, outlet protection that does not involve additional wetland impacts, or check dams to improve the overall stormwater management and sediment control at the construction site. 
(2)  BMP relocations. Relocation of construction entrance, pond inlet pipes (within a pond), and any other proposed BMP to improve the overall stormwater management and sediment control at the construction site. 
(3)  Removal of disturbed areas. As long as the removal of the disturbed area does not also remove any BMPs (ponds, traps, etc.) that are required to meet the state's water quality or quantity standards. Removal of disturbed area only qualifies for disturbed area that was included in the initial coverage approval and that was never disturbed (i.e., cleared, grubbed or graded). 
(4)  Modifying individual lot drainage. Unless the changes affect the inflow to a detention structure or analysis point, to which the lot drains, that was not previously approved. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 6.7, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-163. - Submittal requirements. 
(a)  Narrative. Each C-SWPPP must include a project narrative that accurately addresses the following requirements for each construction site: 
(1)  Scope of project outlined, including a detailed description of pre- and post-development conditions. 
(2)  Description of existing and potential flooding problems at the site due to pre-construction drainage conditions, and any potential flooding problems within the surrounding area that may be a direct result of current site conditions or the proposed site development. Identify if the site is located within a floodplain. 
(3)  The function of the project (e.g., low density residential, shopping mall, highway, etc.). 
(4)  Estimates of the total area expected to be disturbed by excavation, grading, or other construction activities, including dedicated off-site borrow and fill areas. 
(5)  Information regarding the required on-site support activities (e.g., concrete and asphalt batch plants, etc.). 
(6)  Identification of prior uses of the construction site or potential sources of pollution that may reasonably be expected to cause or contribute to a violation of any applicable water quality standard based upon the existing condition of the construction site. 
(b)  Stormwater management and sediment control. Each C-SWPPP must include a stormwater management and sediment control section that accurately addresses the following requirements for each construction site: 
(1)  Industrial stormwater discharges. Identify and describe the location of any stormwater discharge associated with industrial activity other than construction activities at the construction site. This includes stormwater discharges from dedicated asphalt plants and dedicated concrete plants, which are covered by the permit. 
(2)  Water quality BMPs. Identify and describe all pollution control measures (i.e., BMPs) that will be implemented as part of the construction activities to control pollutants in stormwater discharges. 
(3)  Erosion prevention BMPs. Identify and describe all temporary and final stabilization practices for the construction site, including a schedule of when the practices will be implemented. Use of impervious surfaces for stabilization should be avoided. 
(4)  Structural control measures and floodplain placement. Identify and describe all structural practices used to divert flows from exposed soils; to retain/detain flows; or to otherwise limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from exposed areas of the construction site. Placement of structural practices in floodplains must be in accordance with applicable regulations. 
(5)  Post-construction water quality BMPs. Identify and describe all post-construction stormwater management measures (LIDs, BMPs, etc.) that will be installed during the construction process to control pollutants in stormwater discharges after construction operations have been completed. 
(6)  Construction debris management. Identify and describe all measures to prevent the discharge of building or other similar materials to surface waters of the state, except as authorized by a permit issued under section 404 of the CWA. 
(7)  Construction entrances and dust control. Identify and describe all measures to minimize off-site vehicle tracking of sediments onto paved surfaces and the generation of dust. 
(8)  Stock pile management. Identify and describe potential construction and waste materials expected to be stored on-site. The controls, including storage practices such as roll off containers, spill prevention, and response practices used to minimize exposure of these waste materials to stormwater discharges must also be identified and described. 
(9)  Additional on-site and off-site pollution identification. Identify and describe potential pollutant sources from areas other than construction (including stormwater discharges from dedicated asphalt plants and dedicated concrete plants), and controls and measures that will be implemented at those sites to minimize pollutant discharges. 
(c)  Sequence of construction. 
(1)  The C-SWPPP must include a sequence of construction that accurately describes the nature of the construction activity for each construction site. The sequence of construction must include, at a minimum, the intended sequence and timing of all planned major construction activities that disturb soils such as clearing and grubbing, installing sediment basins prior to remaining land disturbance, initial and final grading, and cut and fill activities at the construction site. 
(2)  When phased erosion prevention and sediment control plans are required, pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of this section, each phase must include a phase-specific sequence of construction that accurately describes the nature of all construction activity for each phase at the construction site. 
(3)  The sequence of construction must be included within the construction site plans, per subsection (i) of this section. The sequence of construction should begin with the installation of any construction entrances and installation of perimeter controls, and should end with the removal of all temporary sediment and erosion control measures and the conversion of any BMPs required to be converted into permanent control measures, once the site has been finally stabilized. The level of detail will vary based on the nature and complexity of the construction project. 
(d)  Site features and sensitive areas. 
(1)  The C-SWPPP must identify and delineate all waters of the state (WoS), including wetlands, located within the disturbed area and/or the total area associated with the construction site. The C-SWPPP must also identify all WoS, including wetlands, which are located immediately adjacent to or within the surrounding area of the construction site. The C-SWPPP must also identify receiving waters, including wetlands and state navigable waters. The following must be addressed when a WoS is required to be identified: 
a.  An additional, separate plan sheet, provided within the construction site plans when necessary that delineates all WoS within the construction site's limits of disturbance, and that identifies all WoS within the surrounding or adjacent areas. This plan sheet must identify all impacted areas with a description of the activities, whether permanent or temporary, and any other relevant information. 
b.  If impacts to WoS, outlined areas of impacts and labeled that no work can begin in this area until all necessary USACOE permits and SCDHEC 401 certifications have been obtained. 
c.  If structural BMPs are proposed to be installed within a WoS, the C-SWPPP must specifically address the requirements listed in subsection (f)(1)g of this section. 
(2)  Buffer zone management. In order to minimize sediment discharges, during construction, if surface waters are located on or immediately adjacent to the construction site, the C-SWPPP must address any stormwater discharges from the construction site to such waters so that these discharges are treated by an undisturbed buffer zone that is capable of achieving maximum pollutant removal. 
a.  Requirements. The C-SWPPP must identify an undisturbed buffer zone that meets the following criteria when surface waters are located on or immediately adjacent to the construction site: 
1.  30-foot, natural buffer. Provide and maintain, at a minimum, a 30-foot undisturbed buffer zone during construction. This natural buffer should be located between the surface waters and the outermost sediment and erosion controls at the construction site; 
2.  45-foot, extended natural buffer around sensitive waters. Provide and maintain, at a minimum, a 45-foot undisturbed buffer during construction where the surface waters are classified as sensitive waters. This extended natural buffer should be located between the surface waters and the outermost sediment and erosion controls at the construction site; 
3.  Velocity dissipation requirements. All discharges into a buffer zone should be nonchannelized and nonconcentrated to prevent erosion, and must first be treated by the construction site's sediment and erosion controls. Velocity dissipation measures may be implemented within a buffer zone via subsection (d)(2)c.4. of this section; 
b.  Compliance options. The C-SWPPP must identify and address each applicable buffer zone management requirement through one of the following compliance options: 
1.  Option A. Provide the entire buffer width. Provide and maintain, at a minimum, the required buffer zone in addition to the required erosion prevention and sediment control BMPs for the construction site. C-SWPPPs pursuing this option must also include the following: 
(i)  Narrative. A narrative detailing that a buffer zone is to be maintained at a length of the required buffer width; and 
(ii)  Maintenance notes. A list of standard notes addressing the maintenance of the buffer zone and supporting BMPs. These notes may be located within the construction site plans.

(e)  Sources of pollution. 
(1)  The C-SWPPP must identify potential sources of pollution, including sediment and fertilizers, which are likely to affect the quality of stormwater discharges from the construction site. Identified sources of pollution must be addressed in the C-SWPPP. A few examples of sources of pollution are listed in subsection (b) of this section.

Each erosion prevention BMP must be designed, installed and maintained to achieve maximum pollutant removal, to the extent that the permittee's discharges shall not cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards, as outlined below and by the design criteria identified in S.C. Code Reg. 72-307, unless specifically exempted by S.C. Code Reg. 72-302.A. 
b.  Stabilization. Except as provided below, initiate soil stabilization measures as soon as practicable whenever land disturbing activities have been temporarily or permanently ceased, but in no case more than 14 days after land disturbing activity in that portion of the construction site has temporarily or permanently ceased. 
1.  Where snow cover or frozen ground conditions preclude stabilization by the 14th day, stabilization measures must be initiated as soon as practicable. 
2.  Where construction activity on a portion of the construction site is temporarily ceased, and earth-disturbing activities will be resumed within 14 days, temporary stabilization measures do not have to be initiated on that portion of the construction site. 
c.  Sediment control BMPs. Each sediment control BMP must be designed, installed and maintained to achieve maximum pollutant removal, to the extent that the permittee's discharges shall not cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards, as outlined below and by the design criteria identified in S.C. Code Reg. 72-307.C.(5).(a), 72-307.C.(5).(b) and 72-307.C.(5).(c), unless specifically exempted by S.C. Code Reg. 72-302.A. 
1.  Inlet protection. Inlet protection must be provided at all existing and newly installed inlets that receive stormwater runoff from the disturbed areas. 
2.  Outlet protection. Outlet protection must be provided at all existing and newly installed outlets, within the construction site's boundary, that discharge stormwater runoff from the disturbed areas. Silt fences may not be used as outlet protection. 
3.  Sediment basins. For common drainage outfalls that serve an area with ten or more disturbed acres, a sediment basin, or equivalent sediment control BMPs, which meets the criteria identified in S.C. Code Reg. 72-307.C.(5), must be provided where attainable until final stabilization of the construction site is achieved. For common drainage outfalls serving an area of less than ten acres, sediment basins are still recommended where applicable. In addition the sediment basin must be designed to meet the following requirements: 
(i)  When computing the number of acres draining into a common drainage outfall, it is not necessary to include flows from off-site areas and flows from on-site areas that are undisturbed or have undergone final stabilization, and have been diverted around both the disturbed area and the sediment basin. 
(ii)  In determining whether installing a sediment basin is attainable, the SWPPP preparer may consider factors such as soils, slope, available area on-site, etc. If a sediment basin is determined to be not attainable, sediment traps or equivalent sediment control BMPs should be used (e.g., silt fences, vegetative buffer strips, rock check dams, rock sediment dikes, or a combination of these). 
(iii)  In any event, the SWPPP preparer must consider public safety as a design factor for the sediment basin, and alternative sediment controls must be used where construction site limitations would preclude a safe design. 
(iv)  Unless infeasible, properly design, install and maintain porous baffles, or similar control measures capable of enhancing settling capabilities and restricting the accumulation of sediment around the outlet structure, in all temporary sediment traps and sediment basins to reduce velocity, turbulence, and improve sediment trapping efficiency. 
(v)  Unless infeasible, sediment forebays, or similar control measures capable of providing sediment trapping at inlets of sediment basins, should be installed as practicable based on sediment storage requirements of each sediment basin. 
(vi)  Unless infeasible, each sediment basin must be equipped with a cleanout stake indicating when the basin is to be cleaned.

This outlet structure should be capable of conveying the flow for the ten-year, 24-hour event. 
d.  Runoff control and conveyance measures BMPs. Each runoff control and conveyance measure BMP must be designed, installed and maintained to achieve maximum pollutant removal, to the extent that the permittee's discharges that shall not cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards, as outlined below and by the design criteria identified in S.C.

1.  Permanent conveyance measures. Each conveyance measure must be stabilized and capable of handling the 25-year, 24-hour storm event with non-erosive flow conditions during construction and post-construction. If the velocity exceeds four feet per second, then permanent velocity dissipation measures, devices, and/or erosion prevention BMPs must be installed to provide non-erosive flow conditions. 
2.  Temporary conveyance channels. Design channels to avoid disturbed areas and to reduce erosion. Divert concentrated flows of stormwater running onto the site and within the construction site to avoid contact with soils exposed during construction, unless infeasible. Prevent erosion of channel embankments, outlets, adjacent streambanks, slopes and downstream waters during discharge conditions through the use of velocity dissipation devices (e.g., check dams, sediment traps, riprap, or grouted riprap at outlets) within and along the length of any constructed stormwater conveyance channel, and at any outlets to provide a non-erosive flow velocity. 
3.  Stabilization of conveyance channels. Complete stabilization of stormwater conveyance channels (within seven days of channel construction). Examples of vegetative and nonvegetative stabilization techniques include channel liners, rolled erosion control products (e.g., erosion control blankets and turf reinforcement mats), riprap, geotextiles, or other armoring materials that are suitable for use in areas with concentrated or channelized flow. Application of mulch, hydromulch, tackifier, or similar erosion prevention practices that are erodible, conveyable, or that obstruct flow when used in areas with concentrated or channelized flow in stormwater conveyance channels is prohibited. 
4.  Storm drainage systems. No new point discharges onto adjacent property where there was not a point discharge previously, unless written permission from the adjacent property owner is provided. A 20-foot minimum buffer should be provided, where feasible, between the property line and the discharge point. Level spreaders, plunge pools, etc., shall be provided when the proposed outlet is near the property line and not directed to an existing outfall, such as a creek or ditch. All outlets from a storm sewer system shall not discharge on fill slopes. 
5.  Velocity dissipation devices. Appropriate velocity dissipation devices and/or erosion prevention BMPs must be placed at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive flow from the structure to a watercourse so that the natural physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected. Silt fences may not be used as an energy dissipater.

2.  Outline the limits of disturbance on the construction plans and label areas within the construction site that are not to be disturbed. 
3.  Stabilize exposed areas as soon as practical to limit the duration of large areas of exposed soil. 
4.  Implement temporary seeding techniques. 
d.  Minimize the disturbance of existing steep slopes (i.e., slopes of 30 percent (~3H:1V) or greater), unless infeasible. If steep slopes must be disturbed, or are created through grading activities, the C-SWPPP must: 
1.  Divert flows around steep slope disturbances. Divert concentrated or channelized flows of stormwater away from and around areas of disturbance having steep slopes; 
2.  Use BMP controls. Use appropriate erosion prevention and sediment control BMPs such as permanent seeding with soil binders, erosion control blankets, surface roughening, continuous slope length reduction through terracing or diversions, gradient terraces, interceptor dikes and swales, grass-lined channels, pipe slope drains, subsurface drains, level spreaders, rock ditch checks, seep berms, and sediment dikes; and 
3.  Stabilize promptly. Initiate stabilization measures on any exposed steep slope area where land disturbing activities have permanently or temporarily ceased, and will not resume for a period of seven calendar days; 
e.  Minimize sediment discharges from the site during construction activity. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment controls must address factors such as the amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of the resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes expected to be present on the construction site, while minimizing sediment discharges to the maximum extent practical. 
f.  Provide and maintain natural buffers around surface waters and, after stormwater runoff is treated by the construction site's BMPs, direct the construction site discharges into these vegetated areas to increase sediment removal and maximize stormwater infiltration, unless infeasible (see subsection (d)(2) of this section) during construction activity. 
g.  Minimize soil compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. 
(2)  Soil stabilization. Permittees are required to initiate stabilization measures as soon as practicable whenever any clearing, grading, excavating or other earth disturbing activities have permanently or temporarily ceased on any portion of the site and will not resume for a period exceeding 14 calendar days. Stabilization must be completed as soon as practicable. For areas where initiating stabilization measures is infeasible (e.g., where snow cover, frozen ground, or drought conditions preclude stabilization), initiate vegetative or non-vegetative stabilization measures as soon as practicable. 
(3)  Trenches and excavations dewatering. Permittees are required to minimize the discharge of pollutants from dewatering trenches and excavations. Discharges are prohibited unless managed by appropriate BMPs for stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. 
(4)  Pollutant discharge minimization during construction activity. Permittees are required to design, install, implement, and maintain effective pollution prevention measures to minimize the discharge of pollutants during construction activity. At a minimum, such measures must be designed, installed, implemented and maintained to: 
a.  Minimize the discharge of pollutants from equipment and vehicle washing, wheel wash water, and other wash waters. Wash waters must be treated in a sediment basin or alternative control that provides equivalent or better treatment prior to discharge; 
b.  Minimize the exposure of building materials, building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, sanitary waste and other materials present on the site to precipitation and to stormwater; and 
c.  Minimize the discharge of pollutants from spills and leaks and implement chemical spill and leak prevention and response procedures. 
(5)  Prohibited discharges. The following discharges from sites are prohibited: 
a.  Wastewater from washout of concrete, unless managed by an appropriate control; 
b.  Wastewater from washout and cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds and other construction materials; 
c.  Fuels, oils, or other pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance; and 
d.  Soaps or solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing. 
(k)  Management of non-stormwater discharges. 
(1)  The C-SWPPP must identify all allowable sources of non-stormwater discharges, except for flows from fire fighting activities that are combined with stormwater discharges associated with construction activity at the site. non-stormwater discharges should be eliminated or reduced to the extent where these discharges shall not cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards. 
(2)  The C-SWPPP must identify and ensure the implementation of appropriate pollution prevention measures for the non-stormwater component of the discharge. 
(l)  Documentation of permit eligibility related to total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). For construction sites with stormwater discharges to a receiving water that is identified as being impaired or has an EPA established or approved TMDL the following requirements must be addressed by the C-SWPPP: 
(1)  Receiving water with TMDLs. If a TMDL, that is applicable to stormwater construction discharges, has been established and is in effect for any receiving waters downstream of a construction site, then the C-SWPPP must address the following: 
a.  Include documentation supporting a determination of permit eligibility with regard to waters that have a TMDL that is effective and applicable to stormwater construction discharges; 
b.  Include documentation of whether the construction site's stormwater discharge is identified, either specifically or generally, in a TMDL and if there is any associated allocations, requirements, and assumptions identified for the construction site's discharge; 
c.  Identify if a specific waste load allocation (WLA) has been established that would apply to the construction site's stormwater discharges, and incorporate that allocation into the stormwater management plan by implementing any necessary steps and/or BMPs to meet that allocation; and 
d.  Identify measures to be taken by the operator so that the construction site's discharge of pollutants is consistent with the allocations, assumptions, and requirements contained in the TMDL, only the pollutants applicable to stormwater discharges, including any specific WLA that has been established. 
(2)  Receiving waters with impairments. If the receiving water is listed on the most current S.C. Code Reg. 303(d) List of Impaired Waters, the C-SWPPP must be developed so that any stormwater discharges from the construction site do not cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above any state water quality standard. For receiving waters listed for a sediment or a sediment-related parameter (i.e., BIO (macroinvertebrate), turbidity, total phosphorous and total nitrogen, chlorophyll-a) the C-SWPPP must address the following: 
a.  Carefully evaluate all selected BMPs and their performance such that the construction site's stormwater discharges will not cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above any state water quality standard. 
b.  For construction sites that disturb 25 acres or more and which have stormwater discharges draining directly to an impaired water body via structures or ditches, the C-SWPPP must contain a written quantitative and qualitative assessment that the BMPs selected will control the construction site's stormwater discharges so that they will not cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above any state water quality standard.

ARTICLE VII. - IMPLEMENTATION, INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS AND OFF-SITE DAMAGE CORRECTION 

Sec. 82-195. - Pre-construction conferences. 
(a)  A pre-construction conference must be held for each construction project or site with an approved on-site stormwater pollution prevention plan (OS-SWPPP). Each contractor, subcontractor, blanket utility provider, etc., who will work at a site must attend this conference in person. The primary purpose of this conference is for: 
(1)  The preparer of the SWPPP or someone with a registration equivalent to that of the preparer of the SWPPP; and/or 
(2)  The person with operational control of the plans and specifications (the primary or secondary permittee) or their duly authorized representative (as defined in section 122.22(b) of S.C. Code Reg. 61-9)). 
(3)  Review and explanation of the on-site SWPPP (OS-SWPPP) so that all are aware of the requirements before they start performing construction-related (land disturbing) activities that may affect the implementation of the approved OS-SWPPP. This conference may be held simultaneously with all contractors and builders present or may be conducted separately with one or more contractors, subcontractors, etc., present. 
(b)  Linear construction of roads or utilities (such as roads and utility construction including electrical power lines, gas lines, main sewer trunk lines, and water distribution lines) that are not part of a larger common plan (i.e., subdivision or other type of development) are considered to be linear construction projects or linear construction sites under the permit. Linear construction performed as a part of or within an LCP project or site, is considered to be linear construction activities under the permit and not linear construction projects or sites. 
(c)  Pre-construction conference location requirements are defined below. 
(1)  For nonlinear construction projects/sites that disturb ten acres or more, the pre-construction conference must be held on-site unless it is justified in the SWPPP and approved by the department to conduct the conference off-site. 
(2)  For nonlinear construction projects/sites that disturb less than ten acres, conferences may be held off-site unless specifically required in writing or as a condition of the approved OS-SWPPP by the department or the respective MS4 to be conducted on-site. 
(3)  For linear construction projects/sites that are not part of a larger common plan (LCP), subdivision or other type of development, conferences may be held off-site unless specifically required in writing or as a condition of the approved OS-SWPPP by the department or the respective MS4 to be conducted on-site. 
(4)  For linear construction activities (within a LCP), conferences must be held in accordance with disturbed area (< ten acres or > ten acres) criterion established for nonlinear projects/sites in subsections (c)(1)and (2) of this section. 
(5)  In addition, the person conducting the conference (owner/operator) may choose, at their discretion, to hold a conference normally held off-site, on-site. 
(d)  Each pre-construction conference must also specifically address section 82-162, detailing how each type of modification, major and minor, will be addressed and processed at the construction site to maintain compliance with the permit. 
(e)  Persons conducting this conference must document each contractor, subcontractor, blanket utility, etc., attending the conference. This documentation must be maintained with the on-site SWPPP (OS-SWPPP), and include dates, locations, times, as well as, identification of those in attendance. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 7.1, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-196. - Inspections. 
(a)  Scope. Construction site inspections are to be conducted on a routine basis, as outlined in subsection (b) of this section, and must include all areas disturbed by construction activity, including perimeter BMPs and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation. Each inspection must look for the evidence of, or the potential for, inefficiencies within the implemented OS-SWPPP, whether the inefficiencies are a direct result of improper design, installation or maintenance, by inspecting, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  All areas of the site disturbed by construction activity and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation; 
(2)  All stormwater conveyance systems for any evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering these systems; 
(3)  All BMPs identified in the OS-SWPPP; 
(4)  All discharge locations to ascertain whether the implemented BMPs are effective in preventing the discharge of sediment from the site. Where discharge locations are inaccessible, nearby downstream locations must be inspected to the extent that such inspections are practicable; and 
(5)  Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site must be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking. 
If inspection responsibilities are not shared between the primary and secondary permittees, each secondary permittee must provide their own inspections for the portions of the site for which their coverage includes. 
(b)  Frequency. After construction activities begin, inspections must be conducted at a minimum of at least once every calendar week and must be conducted until final stabilization is reached on all areas of the construction site. An inspection is recommended within 24 hours of the end of a storm event of 0.5 inches or greater. 
(1)  The department on a case-by-case basis may require any permittee who has coverage under this CGP to conduct inspections on a more frequent basis than prescribed in this CGP. Examples include, but are not limited to, permittees who have compliance problems and permittees whose construction site's stormwater discharges to sensitive waters (such as waters classified as trout waters, outstanding resource waters, shellfish harvesting waters, etc.). 
(2)  Inspection frequencies for portions of the construction site that have reached temporary or final stabilization may be reduced to at least once every month, as long as the stabilization is maintained and there is no additional disturbance in these areas. Once a definable area has reached final stabilization, the permittee may mark this on the on-site SWPPP and no further inspection requirements apply to that portion of the site (e.g., land disturbing activities around one of three buildings in a complex are completed and the disturbed area has reached final stabilization, one mile of a roadway or pipeline project is completed and the disturbed area has reached final stabilization, etc.). Inspection of common BMPs, such as sediment basins, sediment traps, may be required to resume if areas that drain to them become disturbed during future construction. 
(c)  Linear site inspection frequency. Utility line installation, pipeline construction, and other examples of long, narrow, linear construction activities may limit the access of inspection personnel to the areas described in subsection (a) of this section. Inspection of these areas could require that vehicles compromise temporarily or even permanently stabilized areas, cause additional disturbance of soils, and increase the potential for erosion. 
(1)  In these circumstances, controls must be inspected on the same frequencies as other construction projects, but representative inspections may be performed. For representative inspections, personnel must inspect controls along the construction site for 0.25 mile above and below each access point where a roadway, undisturbed right-of-way, or other similar feature intersects the construction site and allows access to the areas described above. 
(2)  The conditions of the controls along each inspected 0.25 mile segment may be considered as representative of the condition of controls along that reach extending from the end of the 0.25 mile segments to either the end of the next 0.25 mile inspected segment, or to the end of the construction site, whichever occurs first. Representative inspections must include any areas where stormwater discharges to sensitive waters (such as waters classified as trout waters, outstanding resource waters, shellfish harvesting waters, etc.). 
(d)  Rain gauge. Permittees shall either maintain an on-site rain gauge or use data from a certified weather record (such as a personal weather station or an airport) located within a reasonable proximity of the construction site, to record rainfall records from any significant rainfall event, 0.5 inches or greater. These recorded rainfall amounts must be maintained in a rain log located in the on-site SWPPP. Rainfall records for the day of an inspection and any significant rainfall events since the last inspection must be reported on each weekly inspection report. 
(e)  Inspector qualifications. Inspections must be conducted by qualified personnel (provided by the permittee) as outlined by the following: 
(1)  For projects that disturb more than one acre "qualified personnel" means a person knowledgeable in the principles and practice of erosion and sediment controls who possesses the skills to assess conditions at the construction site that could impact stormwater quality and to assess the effectiveness of any BMPs selected to control the quality of stormwater discharges from the construction site. This person must be either the preparer of the C-SWPPP or an individual who is under the direct supervision of the preparer of the approved C-SWPPP and who meets the requirements in this section or an individual who has been certified through a construction site inspector certification course that has been approved by SCDHEC. Inspections may also be conducted by a person with a registration equivalent to the registration of the preparer of the C-SWPPP and who meets the qualifications of this section or an individual who is under the direct supervision of the person with an equivalent registration and who meets the requirements in this section. 
(2)  For projects that disturb one acre or less, and that are not part of a larger common plan, the permittee or his designee may perform these inspections provided the preparer of the C-SWPPP or someone with a registration equivalent to that of the preparer of the C-SWPPP explains the OS-SWPPP including implementation along with the inspection requirements to the person who will be conducting the inspections. 
(3)  The city reserves the right to require that inspections be performed by an inspector meeting the requirements of subsection (e)(1) of this section for construction sites less than one acre in size that drain to sensitive waters, when deemed necessary. 
(f)  Inspection reports. For each inspection required above, the permittee must complete an inspection report. At a minimum, the inspection report must include: 
(1)  The inspection date; 
(2)  Names, titles, and, if not previously given in an inspection report, the qualifications of personnel making the inspection, unless those qualifications change; 
(3)  Weather information for the period since the last inspection (or since commencement of construction activity if the first inspection) including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of each storm event, approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event (in inches), and whether the permittee knows if any discharges occurred. At the very least, the total rainfall (in inches) since the time of the last inspection must be recorded; 
(4)  Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring at the time of the inspection; 
(5)  Location of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from the site; 
(6)  Location of BMPs that need maintenance; 
(7)  Location of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate for a particular location; 
(8)  Location where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the time of inspection; 
(9)  Corrective action required including any changes to the OS-SWPPP necessary and implementation dates; 
(10)  Site name, operator name and permit number; 
(11)  Verification that all BMPs and stormwater controls identified in the OS-SWPPP have been installed and are operating as designed; and 
(12)  The city reserves the right to request monthly inspection reports on a case by case basis. 
(g)  Inspection records. A record of each inspection and of any actions taken in accordance with this section must be retained as part of the on-site SWPPP for at least three years from the date that permit coverage expires or is terminated. The qualified inspector, as identified in subsection (e) of this section, must sign the inspection report. 
(h)  Primary permittees. Inspectors employed by the primary permittee retain the authority to inspect, report, and document areas of the construction site that are under direct control of the secondary permittee, but only when a lack of compliance by the secondary permittee inhibits the primary permittee's ability to maintain compliance with the overall OS-SWPPP or the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 7.2, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-197. - Maintenance. 
(a)  The city shall provide procedures to ensure that deficiencies indicated by inspections are rectified. The procedures shall include the following: 
(1)  Notification to the person responsible for maintenance of deficiencies including a time frame for repairs; 
(2)  Subsequent inspection to ensure completion of repairs; and 
(3)  Effective enforcement procedures or procedures to refer projects to the commission if repairs are not undertaken or are not done properly. 
(b)  Construction maintenance. All BMPs and other protective measures identified in the OS-SWPPP must be maintained in effective operating condition. If site inspections required by section 82-196 identify BMPs that are not operating effectively, maintenance must be performed within seven calendar days, before the next inspection, or as reasonably possible, and before the next storm event whenever practicable to maintain the continued effectiveness of stormwater controls. If periodic inspection or other information indicates that a BMP has been used inappropriately, or incorrectly, the permittee must address the necessary replacement or modification required to correct the BMP within a time frame of 48 hours of identification. If existing BMPs need to be modified or if additional BMPs are necessary to comply with the requirements of the permit and/or the state's water quality standards, implementation must be completed before the next storm event whenever practicable. If implementation before the next storm event is impracticable, the situation must be documented in the OS-SWPPP and alternative BMPs must be implemented as soon as reasonably possible. Sediment from sediment traps or sedimentation basins must be removed as indicated in the OS-SWPPP or when the design capacity has been reduced by 50 percent, whichever occurs first. Sediment collected by silt fences, or another sediment control measure, must be removed when the deposited sediment reaches one-third of the height of the above-ground portion of these BMPs, or before it reaches a lower height based on the manufacturer's specifications. 
(c)  Permanent maintenance. Permanent stormwater management structures must be routinely maintained to operate per design. The city requires inclusion of a permanent stormwater management maintenance agreement and a maintenance plan to ensure proper operation. Provide a detailed proposed maintenance plan for permanent stormwater management structures proposed for the project in the narrative. The maintenance agreement and maintenance plan, when required, must be identified and located in the C-SWPPP. 
(d)  Maintenance agreements. Permanent stormwater management maintenance agreement must meet the following information as a minimum: 
(1)  Signed notarized agreement from the responsible party or individual accepting ownership and maintenance of each permanent stormwater control device/structure, including any permanent LID and/or proprietary control devices (oil-water separators, etc.), underground detention structures, exfiltration systems and nontraditional stormwater controls (constructed wetlands, bioretention, etc.) incorporated into the construction process. 
(2)  A generic template of a maintenance agreement may be found at www.scdhec.gov/environment/ocrm/docs/SW/pond_maint.pdf. 
(3)  This template may be modified to identify each permanent structure for the applicant's project. 
(4)  The city must be notified in writing of any changes in maintenance responsibility for the stormwater devices at the site (include this statement in agreement). 
(e)  Maintenance plans. All maintenance plans must meet the following information as a minimum: 
(1)  Description of maintenance plan to be used. 
(2)  Make sure that detailed or manufacturer-specific maintenance procedures are included for any permanent LID and/or proprietary control devices (oil-water separators, etc.), underground detention structures, exfiltration systems and nontraditional stormwater controls (constructed wetlands, bioretention, etc.) incorporated into the construction process. 
(3)  Identify each maintenance activity (e.g., inspection, mowing, removing debris, etc.) to be completed. Typical maintenance items to be addressed include but not limited to: 
a.  Grass to be mowed; 
b.  Trees to be removed from within the pond and on the embankment; 
c.  Trash and sediment to be removed from inside of and around the pond outlet structure; 
d.  Orifices to be cleaned and unclogged; 
e.  Outlet pipe to be cleaned, inspected, and repaired; 
f.  Sediment accumulation to be removed from pond; 
g.  Pond bottom to be regraded to provide proper drainage towards the outlet discharge point; 
h.  Energy dissipator to be cleaned and repaired; 
i.  Emergency spillway, if applicable, to be inspected and repaired; and 
j.  Erosion on side slopes, if present, to be addressed. 
(4)  Schedule or frequency for completing each maintenance activity of maintenance procedures (e.g., every six months). 
(f)  Secondary permittee common BMP maintenance requirement. It shall be the responsibility of the secondary permittee to either maintain or coordinate the maintenance of any common stormwater BMPs, accepting stormwater discharges from any area associated with their work, with the primary permittee or the party responsible for permanent maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 7.3, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-198. - Off-site damage correction. 
(a)  The following criteria shall be used by the appropriate implementing agency in evaluating and for correcting off-site damages resulting from the land disturbing activity: 
(1)  Determine the extent of damage by sediment resulting from noncompliance with the approved stormwater management and sediment control plan (SWMSCP or SWPPP); 
(2)  Determine the classification of the impaired waterbody, if any; for the purposes of administering this article, off-site damages shall include any restrictions to flow or reduced flow/capacity of stormwater management devices that serve more than a single residential/commercial/industrial lot; 
(3)  Determine the impact and severity of the damage resulting from noncompliance with the approved stormwater management and sediment control plan; 
(4)  Develop an agreement with landowners for cleanup and corrections, including a schedule of implementation; and 
(5)  Evaluate the alternatives for correction of the damage and prevention of future damage. 
(b)  Failure to implement the agreement in the required schedule will constitute a violation of these regulations.

Sec. 82-221. - Requiring an individual or an alternate general permit. 
(a)  In accordance with section 122.28(b)(3) of S.C. Code Reg. 61-9, SCDHEC may require the applicant to apply for and/or obtain an individual NPDES permit. Any interested person may petition SCDHEC to take action under this subsection. If SCDHEC requires the applicant to apply for an individual NPDES permit, SCDHEC will notify the applicant in writing that a permit application is required. This notification will include a brief statement of the reasons for this decision and an application form. In addition, if the applicant is an existing permittee covered under the permit, the notice will set a deadline to file the application, and will include a statement that on the effective date of issuance or denial of the individual NPDES permit or the alternative general permit as it applies to the permittee, coverage under this general permit will automatically terminate. SCDHEC may grant additional time to submit the application upon the applicant's request. If the permittee is covered under the permit and the permittee fails to submit in a timely manner an individual NPDES permit application as required by SCDHEC, then the applicability of the permit to the permittee is automatically terminated at the end of the day specified by SCDHEC as the deadline for application submittal. 
(b)  If an alternate general permit that is more appropriate for the applicant's construction activity is available, SCDHEC may grant the applicant coverage under the alternate general permit in lieu of granting the applicant coverage under the permit. In accordance with applicable state law and regulation, the applicant has a right to appeal SCDHEC's decision. 
(c)  An applicant may request to be excluded from the coverage of the permit by applying for an individual permit. In such a case, the applicant must submit an individual application in accordance with the requirements of section 122.26(c)(1)(ii) of S.C. Code Reg. 61-9, with reasons supporting the request, to: Stormwater Permitting Section Bureau of Water SCDHEC, 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, SC 29201. The request may be granted by issuance of an individual permit or an alternative general permit if the applicant's reasons are adequate to support the request. 
(d)  When an individual NPDES permit is issued to an applicant, who is otherwise subject to the permit, or an applicant is authorized to discharge under an alternative NPDES general permit, the applicability of the permit to the permittee is automatically terminated on the effective date of the individual permit or the date of authorization of coverage under the alternative general permit, whichever the case may be. If the permittee, who is otherwise subject to the permit, is denied an individual NPDES permit or an alternative NPDES general permit, the applicability of the permit to the permittee is automatically terminated on the date of such denial, unless otherwise specified by SCDHEC.

Sec. 82-222. - Releases in excess of reportable quantities. 
(a)  The permittee must prevent or minimize the discharge of hazardous substances or oil in stormwater discharges from the construction site in accordance with the C-SWPPP. The permit does not relieve the permittee of the federal reporting requirements of 40 CFR part 110, 40 CFR part 117 and 40 CFR part 302 relating to spills or other releases of oils or hazardous substances. 
(b)  Where a release containing a hazardous substance or oil in an amount equal to or in excess of a reportable quantity established under either 40 CFR part 110, 40 CFR part 117 or 40 CFR part 302, occurs during a 24-hour period: 
(1)  The permittee must notify the city and SCDHEC's emergency response section at (803) 253-6488 and the National Response Center (NRC) (800) 424-8802 in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 110, 40 CFR part 117 and 40 CFR part 302 as soon as site staff have knowledge of the discharge; and 
(2)  The permittee must modify the C-SWPPP as required under section 82-162 within 14 calendar days of knowledge of the release to: provide a description of the release, the circumstances leading to the release, and the date of the release. In addition, the permittee must review the C-SWPPP to identify measures to prevent the reoccurrence of such releases and to respond to such releases, and the permittee must modify the C-SWPPP where appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2469, § 8.3, 8-6-2013) 
Sec. 82-223. - Attainment of water quality standards after authorization. 
(a)  The permittee must select, install, implement and maintain BMPs at the construction site that minimize pollutants in the discharge as necessary to meet applicable water quality standards. In general the C-SWPPP developed, implemented, and updated consistent with article VI of this chapter is considered as stringent as necessary to ensure that site discharges do not cause or contribute to a violation of any applicable water quality standard. 
(b)  All written responses required under this part must include a signed certification consistent with section 122.22 of S.C. Code Reg. 61-9.

ARTICLE XII. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 82-330. - Findings. 
    The city council makes the following findings of fact: 
(1)  Stormwater management activities, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of the city's stormwater system, including pipes, ditches, channels, catchbasins, outfalls and drainage easements, are critical to reducing pollution, sedimentation, flooding and erosion. These maintenance activities and practices help to protect the health and safety of the city's residents. 
(2)  A schedule of stormwater utility service charges based on the area of impervious coverage on each property is an appropriate means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities throughout the city. Such charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, allocations of other revenues available to the city, special service fees, special assessments, and other revenues as deemed appropriate by the city council. 
(3)  Credits against stormwater utility service charges are an appropriate means of adjusting fees, rates, rentals, charges, fines, and penalties in certain cases, and should be granted for properties providing on-site or off-site services, systems, facilities, activities, or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of said property on the city's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, and that such credits should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities, or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city manager or designee. 
(4)  The stormwater fee schedule will be applicable for the duration of an initial two-year interim period. During this interim period, a stormwater utility rate study will be developed to determine the accurate fees needed to manage, protect, regulate and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities of the city, and to determine what fees are appropriate, fair, and reasonable to charge the citizens of the community in the future. The stormwater utility rate study shall establish the appropriate credits that may be available once the accurate fees have been determined. The base rate will be revised upon completion of the rate study to meet long term needs of the stormwater management program. 
(5)  The runoff associated with impervious surfaces on each property is the principal factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and that the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge. 
(6)  All revenues raised through the implementation of the stormwater utility shall be allocated specifically to stormwater management services and stormwater management systems. Such revenues shall be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating, and non-operating costs and debt service of bonds for stormwater management purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2403, § 1, 6-21-2011) 
Sec. 82-331. - Authority. 
    This article may be cited as the stormwater utility ordinance and is adopted pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 48-14-10 et seq., S.C. Code 1976, § 5-7-30 and S.C. Land Resources Conservation Commission Regulations 72-300 to 72-316.

(3)  Terms used in present tense shall include the future, and terms used in the singular include the plural, and plural the singular, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary. 
(b)  The city council hereby establishes a stormwater utility within the stormwater utility department under the direction of public services. The utility shall support stormwater management throughout the city's incorporated limits, and shall provide for the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation and enforcement, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. 
(c)  The city council directs that a stormwater fund be established in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including, but not limited to, rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by city council. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the stormwater fund, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility fund may be applied to stormwater management operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(d)  The city council hereby transfers to the stormwater utility the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and other interests and assets including, but not limited to, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment. The city council declares that the economic value to the city of the stormwater systems, facilities, and other interests and assets hereby transferred to the utility is equal to the economic value to the city of the utility assuming future responsibility for the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of the stormwater systems, facilities, and programs.

    Credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge or other fees, rates, rentals, charges, fines, and penalties to an individual property based on: the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility; and/or continuing provision of a service or activity that reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities; and/or on the direct discharge of runoff to a receiving water that is not operated, maintained, improved, and regulated, now or in the future, by the city. 
    Customers of the stormwater utility includes those persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater, stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program. 
    Developed land means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 200 contiguous square feet of impervious surfaces as defined in this article. 
    Impervious surfaces means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
    Industrial properties includes all properties developed for uses other than residential and commercial properties, as defined in this article. 
    Residential properties includes, but is not limited to, the following categories which will be identified as the appropriate dwelling unit classifications to be utilized in applying the stormwater utility fee structure to the designations contained within the city: single-family, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, mobile home parks, mobile home lots. 
    Stormwater management services means those activities and functions conducted by the city that together result in the collection, conveyance, and disposal of stormwater runoff, including support activities and functions necessary to accomplish the mission of the stormwater management program, and shall include but not be limited to the administration, engineering, operation and maintenance, regulation and enforcement, and improvement of systems and facilities, review of development proposals and of the installation and maintenance of stormwater systems on private properties, provision of stormwater quality management programs to eliminate or mitigate the impact of pollutants contained in stormwater runoff, and flood emergency response and recovery measures.

(b)  The notice must describe the year, make, model and serial number of the vehicle; set forth where the motor vehicle is being held; and inform the owner and any lienholders of the right to reclaim the vehicle within 30 days after the date of the notice, by payment of all fines, penalties and immobilization, impoundment and storage fees. The notice must further state that the failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise any right to reclaim within the specified time constitutes waiver of any right, title and interest in the vehicle and consent to the sale of the vehicle at a public auction. 
(c)  If the certified letter is returned unclaimed; the identity of the last owner cannot be determined; the registration contains no address for the owner; or if it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and address of all lienholders, notice by single publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area is sufficient to meet all requirements of notice. The notice by publication may contain multiple listings of vehicles. This notice by publication must meet the same time restrictions and content requirements prescribed for notice by mail. 
(d)  No lienholder is subject to any penalty imposed unless the vehicle has been declared a public nuisance as a result of the actions of the lienholder, the lienholder's agent or the lienholder's servant. If the owner fails to exercise the right to recover a vehicle seized and a lienholder who is not legally responsible for the penalties presents a legal and timely proof and claim for the vehicle, the vehicle will be released to the lienholder upon payment of any towing or storage fee due. Release is further conditioned upon lienholder's written agreement that, if the lienholder sells or returns the vehicle to the owner or person who accrued the parking tickets, immediate payment of all accrued fines and penalties shall be paid to the city. 
(e)  If a vehicle which has been impounded as a result of this article has not been reclaimed as provided in this article, the chief of police may sell the vehicle at a public auction. The purchaser of the vehicle takes title to it free and clear of all liens and claims of ownership, shall receive a sales receipt from the chief of police, and shall be entitled to register the purchased vehicle and receive a certificate of title. The sales receipt at such sale shall be sufficient title only for purposes of transferring the vehicle to a demolisher for demolition, wrecking or dismantling, and in such case no further titling of the vehicle shall be necessary. The expenses of the auction, the costs of towing and storing the vehicle, the wheel immobilizer assessment, the fines and penalties, and all notice and publication costs incurred shall be reimbursed from the proceeds of the sale of the vehicle. Any remainder of the proceeds from the sale shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days and then shall be deposited in the general fund of the municipality. 
(Code 1976, § 19-194; Code 1998, § 86-67; Ord. No. 1489, § 19-197, 11-21-1995) 
Sec. 94-68. - Claims of, and awards to, owners or lienholders. 
(a)  The city council shall hear and determine requests for reimbursement by any owner or lienholder whose vehicle is sold pursuant to this article. All claims must be made within two years of the date that the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle were paid into the general fund of the municipality. Total reimbursement to all claimants shall not exceed the net amount deposited into the general fund as a result of the sale of the vehicle. If prior reimbursement claims have been honored, subsequent reimbursement claims are limited to the amount of proceeds remaining for that vehicle. 
(b)  The city assumes no liability for loss or damage to any person or to any vehicle or its contents as a result of immobilization, towing, impoundment, notice, forfeiture or sale pursuant to this article and specifically limits recovery to the net amount received as the result of the sale. 
(Code 1976, § 19-195; Code 1998, § 86-68) 
Sec. 94-69. - Criminal penalty for failure to pay parking tickets. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any vehicle owner who has not invoked the exceptions set forth in section 94-39 to allow a ticket for a stopping, standing or parking violation to remain unpaid over 60 days. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person identified by the vehicle owner pursuant to the exceptions set forth in section 94-39 to allow a parking fine accrued while such person was in possession of a vehicle to remain unpaid over 60 days. 
(c)  When a parking ticket remains outstanding after 30 days, the owner of the vehicle receiving the parking violation will be noticed that the outstanding ticket is past due. 
(d)  The name and address of the owner shall be determined by using the records of the appropriate agency of record for the vehicle in question; a letter sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the name and address recorded by that agency, constitutes proper notice. 
(e)  The notice must: 
(1)  List the fine increases set forth in section 94-62; 
(2)  State the amount of all fines, penalties, and other cost accrued as of the date of the notice; 
(3)  Give notice that penalties will continue to accrue unless the current amount due is paid within ten days of the date of the notice; 
(4)  State that, if the fine remains unpaid after 60 days, criminal prosecution for failure to pay a traffic ticket will occur; and 
(5)  Identify procedure to request a court hearing. 
(f)  Notice is properly served by personal delivery to the individual to be served or by leaving a copy of the notice at the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode with a person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein, or by delivering a copy to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. Proper service may also be accomplished by certified mail with return receipt requested or priority mail with delivery confirmation. 
(g)  Failure of the person noticed to pay or protest the parking fines, penalties and other costs within ten days after written notice constitutes prima facie evidence of intent sufficient to prosecute for failure to pay a parking ticket. 
(h)  When the owner invokes section 94-39 and properly identifies a person in possession of the vehicle at the time of violation, the notice set forth in subsection (c) of this section shall be mailed to that person. 
(i)  The charge of failure to pay a parking ticket shall be brought in municipal court or other court of appropriate jurisdiction. A person convicted of this offense is guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon conviction, the person shall be required to pay all outstanding fines, penalties and costs and shall be sentenced in accordance with section 1-7.

DIVISION 4. - SHORTAGES AND DROUGHT 

Sec. 98-118. - Declaration of policy and authority. 
(a)  The objective of this drought response division is to establish authority, policy and procedure by which the city (water system) will take the proper actions to manage water demand during a drought-related shortage. The division satisfies the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000 and has the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use, sanitation, and fire protection and of allocating water for other purposes in an equitable manner. 
(b)  This division outlines the actions to be taken for the conservation of water supplied by the city (water system). These actions are directed both towards an overall reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply. 
(c)  To satisfy these goals, the city (water system) hereby adopts the following regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water. This division is hereby declared necessary for the protection of public health, safety and welfare and shall take effect upon its adoption by the city (water system). 
(d)  If it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to drought, the city (water system) is authorized to issue a proclamation that existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual water-use demands. The proclamation is an attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent that water-use for human consumption, sanitation, fire protection, and other essential needs becomes endangered. 
(e)  Immediately upon issuance of such a proclamation, regulations and restrictions set forth under this division shall become effective and remain in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the proclamation rescinded. 
(f)  Water uses that are regulated or prohibited under this division are considered to be non-essential and continuation of such uses during times of water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water, subjecting the offenders to penalties. 
(Ord. No. 1998, § A, 4-15-2003) 
Sec. 98-119. - Moderate drought phase. 
    Upon notification by the drought response committee that a moderate drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or upon determination by the city (water system) that a moderate water supply shortage exists based on trigger levels, the city (water system) will seek voluntary reductions from its customers in the use of water for all purposes and voluntary reductions on using water during certain peak water demand periods. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of 20 percent in residential water use and 15 percent in other water uses such as commercial, industrial, institutional and irrigation; and a reduction in overall water use of 15 percent. To accomplish this, the city (water system) will take the following actions: 
(1)  Issue a proclamation to be released to local media, the city's (water system) customers and to the state department of natural resources drought information center that moderate drought conditions are present. 
(2)  Provide written notification to the state department of natural resources drought information center, and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the service area of the water system the voluntary conservation measures that the customers are requested to follow during moderate drought conditions, including: 
a.  Reduce residential water use to 75 gallons per person per day and a maximum of 300 gallons per household per day; 
b.  Eliminate the washing down of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, tennis courts and other hard surfaced areas; 
c.  Eliminate the washing down of buildings for purposes other than immediate fire protection; 
d.  Eliminate the flushing of gutters; 
e.  Eliminate the domestic washing of motorbikes, boats, cars, etc.; 
f.  Eliminate the use of water to maintain fountains, reflection ponds and decorative water bodies for aesthetic or scenic purposes, except where necessary to support aquatic life; 
g.  Reduce watering of lawns, plants, trees, gardens, shrubbery and flora on private or public property to the minimum necessary. Encourage outdoor watering to be done during off-peak hours; 
h.  Reduce the amount of water obtained from fire hydrants for construction purposes, fire drills or for any purpose other than firefighting or flushing necessary to maintain water quality; and 
i.  Limit normal water use by commercial and individual customers including, but not limited to, the following: 
1.  Stop serving water in addition to another beverage routinely in restaurants; 
2.  Stop maintaining water levels in scenic and recreational ponds and lakes, except for the minimum amount required to support aquatic life; 
3.  Cease water service to customers who have been given a ten-day notice to repair one or more leaks and have failed to do so. 
(3)  Intensify maintenance efforts to identify and correct water leaks in the distribution system. 
(4)  Cease to install new irrigation taps on the water system. 
(5)  Continue to encourage and educate customers to comply with voluntary water conservation. 
(Ord. No. 1998, § B, 4-15-2003) 
Sec. 98-120. - Severe drought phase. 
    Upon notification by the drought response committee that a severe drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or upon determination by the city (water system) that a severe water supply shortage exists, the city (water system) will seek voluntary reduction in the use of water for all purposes and mandatory restrictions on non-essential usage and restrictions on times when certain water usage is allowed. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of 25 percent in residential water use, 20 percent in all other water use categories, and a reduction in overall water use of 20 percent. To accomplish these goals, the city (water system) will take the following actions:

(Ord. No. 1998, § C, 4-15-2003) 
Sec. 98-121. - Extreme drought phase. 
    Upon notification by the drought response committee that an extreme drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or upon determination by the city (water system) that an extreme water supply shortage exists based on the trigger levels, the city's (water system) will impose mandatory restrictions in the use of water for all purposes and on the times when certain water usage is allowed. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of 30 percent in residential water use, 25 percent in all other categories of water uses and a reduction in overall water use of 25 percent. To accomplish these goals, the city (water system) will take the following actions: 
(1)  Issue a proclamation to be released to the local media, the city (water system) customers and to the state department of natural resources drought information center that extreme drought conditions are present. 
(2)  Provide written notification to the state department of natural resources drought information center and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the service area of the water system the mandatory restrictions to be placed on the use of water supplied by the utility, including: 
a.  Limiting residential water use of 55 gallons per person per day and a maximum of 225 gallons per household or REU per day. 
b.  Eliminate landscape irrigation by the utility's customers. 
c.  Mandatory restrictions on the use of water supplied by the utility for activities including: 
1.  Eliminate the washing down of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, tennis courts and other hard surfaced areas; 
2.  Eliminate the washing down of buildings for purposes other than immediate fire protection; 
3.  Eliminate the flushing of gutters; 
4.  No domestic washing of motorbikes, boats, cars, etc.; 
5.  Eliminate the use of water to maintain fountains, reflection ponds, and decorative water bodies for aesthetic or scenic purposes, except where necessary to support aquatic life; 
6.  Eliminate filling or maintaining public or private swimming pools; and 
7.  Eliminate obtaining water from fire hydrants for construction purposes, fire drills, or any purpose other than firefighting or flushing necessary to maintain water quality. 
d.  Limit normal water use by commercial and individual customers including, but not limited to, the following: 
1.  Stop serving water in addition to another beverage routinely in restaurants; 
2.  Stop maintaining water levels in scenic and recreational ponds and lakes, except for the minimum amount required to support fish and wildlife; 
3.  Limit irrigating golf courses and any portion of their grounds; 
4.  Cease water service to customers who have been given a ten-day notice to repair one or more leaks and have failed to do so; and 
5.  Limit expanding commercial nursery facilities, placing new irrigated agricultural land in production, or planting or landscaping when required by site design review process. 
(3)  Intensify maintenance efforts to identify and correct water leaks in the distribution system. 
(4)  Continue to cease installation of new irrigation taps on the water system. 
(5)  Outline other conservation measures; examples are: 
a.  Place a moratorium on the issuance of all new water service collections and contracts for all new water main extensions. As part of the public information process, provide notice to developers of the moratorium; 
b.  Encourage all residential water customers to voluntarily reduce overall monthly water usage to 70 percent of the customer's monthly average. 
1.  If voluntary reduction of usage is not successful, the city (water system) may, at its option, implement the following excessive use rate schedule for water: 
(i)  Tier I: 0-7,000 gallons/REU: Regular rate. 
(ii)  Tier II: 7,000-10,000 gallons/REU: Two times regular rate. 
(iii)  Tier III: Over 10,000 gallons/REU: Three times regular rate. 
2.  The following excessive use rate may also be utilized for industrial, commercial, institutional and recreational customers, if voluntary reduction of usage is not successful. 
(i)  Tier I: 75 percent of normal usage: Regular rate. 
(ii)  Tier II: 100,000 gallons greater than 75 percent: $5,000.00 plus all other charges. 
(iii)  Tier III: 100,000-500,000 gallons greater than 75 percent of normal usage: $10,000.00 plus all other charges. 
(iv)  Tier IV: 500,000-1,000,000 gallons greater than 75 percent of normal usage: $25,000.00 plus $5,000.00 for each additional 100,000 gallons over 1,000,000 gallons. 
(v)  Tier V: Greater than 1,000,000 gallons greater than 75 percent of normal usage: $25,000.00 plus $5,000.00 for each additional 100,000 gallons over 1,000,000 gallons. 
c.  Impose a drought surcharge per 1,000 gallons of water that increases with higher usage. The general principle behind the drought surcharge is that the fee is imposed on water use in excess of 70 percent of normal REU use. The drought surcharge is a temporary fee imposed during the current water supply shortage and is not a cost-based rate. The drought surcharge is temporary and will be terminated at such time as the city (water system) determines the water supply is above the trigger levels. 
d.  If the conservation measures of this division or plan prove inadequate to mitigate the effects of the drought conditions or water supply availability, the city (water system) may take additional actions including, but not limited to: 
1.  Decreasing the gallon/REU limits in the different tiers; and 
2.  Reduction of water system pressure as needed. 
(6)  Publicize widely the penalties to be imposed for violations of mandatory restrictions and the procedures to be followed if a variance in the restrictions is requested. 
(7)  Expand the use of education and public relations efforts as conducted under the moderate and severe drought phase and emphasize the penalties associated with violating the mandatory restrictions. 
(8)  Provide written notification monthly to the state department of natural resources drought information center regarding the success of the mandatory restrictions.

(1)  First violation: $50.00 surcharge shall be added to the customer's water bill; 
(2)  Second violation: An additional $100.00 surcharge shall be added to the customer's water bill; 
(3)  Third violation: The customer's water service shall be terminated and restored only after payment of a surcharge of $200.00 in addition to all previously assessed surcharges. 
(b)  Law enforcement agencies and other authorized agencies or designated employees in the respective jurisdiction which is being supplied water by the city (water system) shall diligently enforce the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 1998, § F, 4-15-2003) 
Sec. 98-124. - Variances. 
(a)  Customers, who in their belief are unable to comply with the mandatory water use restrictions of this drought response ordinance, may petition for a variance from restrictions by filing a petition with the city (water system) within ten working days after the issuance of the proclamation requiring water use restrictions. All petitions for variance shall contain the following information: 
(1)  Name and address of the petitioner; 
(2)  Purpose of water usage;

(10)  Steps the petitioner is taking to meet the restrictions from which the variance is sought and the expected date of compliance; and 
(11)  Other information as needed. 
(b)  In order for the variance to be granted, the petitioner must demonstrate clearly that compliance with the division cannot be technically accomplished during the duration of the water supply shortage without having an adverse impact upon the best interests of the community. The city (water system) is authorized to grant the request for variance. 
(c)  In addition, the city (water system) is authorized to grant temporary variances for existing water uses otherwise prohibited under the division if it is determined that failure to grant such variances could cause an emergency condition adversely affecting health, sanitation and fire protection for the public. No such variance shall be retroactive or otherwise justify any violation of this division occurring prior to the issuance of the variance. Variances granted by the city (water system) shall include a timetable for compliance and shall expire when the water supply shortage no longer exists, unless the petitioner has failed to meet specified requirements.

Sec. 98-274. - Bypass. 
(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, or damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice at least ten days before the date of the bypass. A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
(d)  The bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(2)  There was no feasible alternative to the bypass; 
(3)  The user submitted notice as required under subsection (c) of this section.

    Upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

c. Because of these conditions, the application of the ordinance to the
particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably
restrict the utilization of the property.
d. The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to
adjacent property or to the public good, and the granting of the variance
will not harm the character of the district.
2. The Board may not grant a variance the effect of which would be to:
a. Allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in a zoning
district;
b. Extend physically a nonconforming use of land;
City  Zoning and Development Article 1 | 11
Standards Ordinance
January 2014
c. Change zoning district boundaries shown on the Sumter City-County

granted, shall not be considered grounds for a variance.

location, character, or other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as
the Board may consider advisable to promote the public health, safety, or general
welfare.
c. Special Exception:
1. Special exceptions are subject to the terms and conditions for the use set forth for
such uses in the Zoning Ordinance.
2. Permits for Special Exceptions shall be evaluated by the Board of Zoning Appeals
on the basis of the following criteria:

which it is located.
c. That the special exception will not discourage or negate the use of
surrounding property for use(s) permitted by right.
3. In granting a special exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such
additional stipulations, conditions, or safeguards as, in its judgment, will enhance
the siting of the special exception. At the conclusion of the review, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall approve the application with specific modification, or
disapprove the application. If approved, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
instruct the Zoning Administrator to issue such permits contingent on the specific
modification imposed. If disapproved, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify

reasons therefore.

materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.

legislative governing body, a property owner may appeal by filing a petition in writing
setting forth plainly, fully, and distinctly why the decision is contrary to law. The
petition must be filed with the circuit court within thirty (30) days of:
1. the report of an impasse as provided in the South Carolina Circuit Court
Alternative Dispute Resolution Rules; or
2. the failure to approve the settlement by the local governing body.
g. The circuit court judge must approve the settlement if the settlement has a rational basis
in accordance with the standards of this chapter. If the mediated settlement is not
approved by the court, the judge must schedule a hearing for the parties to present
evidence and must issue a written opinion containing findings of law and fact. A party
may appeal from the decision:
1. in the same manner as provided by law for appeals from other judgments of the
circuit court; or
2. by filing an appeal pursuant to subsection (f).
1.o.11. Notice of appeal, transcript; supersedeas.
a. Upon filing of an appeal with a petition as provided in Section 1.o.8.a. or Section
1.o.10.f., the clerk of the circuit court must give immediate notice of the appeal to the
secretary of the HPDRC and within thirty (30) days from the time of the notice, the
HPDRC must file with the clerk a duly certified copy of the proceedings held before the
HPDRC, including a transcript of the evidence heard before the HPDRC, if any, and the
decision of the HPDRC including its findings of fact and conclusions.
b. The filing of an appeal in the circuit court from any decision of the HPDRC does not ipso
facto act as a supersedeas, but the judge of the circuit court may, in his discretion, grant a
supersedeas upon such terms and conditions as may seem reasonable and proper.
1.o.12. Determination of appeal; costs; trial by jury.
a. At the next term of the circuit court or in chambers upon ten days notice to the parties,
the resident residing judge of the circuit court of the county must proceed to hear and
pass upon the appeal on the certified record of the HPDRC proceedings. The finings of
fact by the HPDRC are final and conclusive on the hearing of the appeal, and the court
may not take additional evidence. In the event the judge determines that the certified
record is insufficient for review, the matter must be remanded to the HPDRC for
rehearing. In determining the questions presented by the appeal, the court must
determine only whether the decision of the HPDRC is correct as a matter law. In the
event that the decision of the HPDRC is reversed by the circuit court, the HPDRC must
be charged with the costs which must be paid by the governing authority which
established the HPDRC.

subsection prohibits a property owner from subsequently electing to assert a pre-existing
right to trial by jury of any issue beyond the subject matter jurisdiction of the HPDRC.

(22) day suspense.
City Zoning and Development Article 3 | 70
Standards Ordinance
January 2014
During such study, the applicant shall be notified of any discrepancies, and advised of
the willingness of the staff to confer with the applicant for the purpose of assisting in
bringing the material submitted into conformity with the requirements of this
Ordinance or the Comprehensive Plan.
In the course of such conferences any recommendation for change shall be recorded
in writing, with reasons cited, and shall then become part of the record in the
application process. Applicants shall indicate, in writing, their disagreements and
reasons and such response by the applicant shall be included in the record.
At the conclusion of the review stage, the planning staff shall report to the Planning
Commission as to:
1. The type of PD proposed, physical characteristics of the land, relation of the
proposed development to the surrounding areas and existing and probable
future development;
2. The relationship of the PD proposed to major roads, utilities and other
facilities and services;
3. Adequacy of evidence of unified control and suitability of any proposed
agreements, contracts, deed restrictions, sureties, dedications, contributions,
guarantees, or other instruments, or the need for such instruments, or for
amendments in those proposed;
4. The suitability of plans proposed, or the desirability of amendments, with
reasons therefore;
5. Desirable specific modifications in regulations or the Comprehensive Plan as
applicable in a particular case, based on determinations that such
modifications are necessary or justified in the particular case by demonstrating
that the public purpose of the PD District or other regulations would be met to
at least an equivalent degree by the proposal of the applicant. Based on such
findings, the planning staff shall recommend approval of the PD amendment
as proposed, approval conditioned on specific stated modifications, or
disapproval, with recorded reasons therefore.
b. Review Stage: After the sixty (60) day period for the PD subdivision or site plan
application process is concluded, the Planning Commission shall have thirty (30) days
from the Planning Commission meeting, at which the PD application is considered, to
prepare a report and make a recommendation to the City or County Councils on a PD
application. In making its report, the Planning Commission should consider the
following factors:
1. The relationship of the request to the Sumter 2030 Comprehensive Plan;
2. Whether the request violates or supports the Plan;
3. Whether the permitted uses would be appropriate in the area concerned;
City Zoning and Development Article 3 | 71
Standards Ordinance
January 2014
4. Whether adequate public facilities such as roads, water & sewer facilities,
drainage facilities, and schools and other public services exist or can be
provided to serve the needs of the development.
c. City or County Council Action: Action by the City or County Council shall be
provided by Ordinance generally. City or County Council shall grant or deny the PD
application within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the Planning Commissions
recommendation.
Either Council may grant the application, may include specific modifications to the
proposal or other applicable regulations, or may deny the application. If the
Ordinance is granted, the City or County Council shall approve the application as
recommended by the Planning Commission or approve the application with
modifications, which shall be binding on the applicant. If modifications are required,
the City or County Council shall officially state its reasons in the record.
If an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan is involved, neither Council shall
proceed on the PD amendment until the Comprehensive Plan amendment is
completed.
If the application is granted, the development shall be required to be in accord with
the approved PD, meeting the requirements of these and other regulations, as
supplemented or modified by the City or County Council in the particular case as part
of the amendment action, and shall conform to any time or priority limitation
established by the City or County Council on the beginning or completion of the
development as a whole or in specified stages.
In taking action to amend the Official Zoning Map(s) to establish the approved PD,
City or County Council shall pass upon the adequacy of the application, in form
and/or substance relative to any agreements, contracts, deed restrictions, sureties, or
other instruments involved, and before development may proceed, such instruments
shall be approved by the appropriate city or county officers and departments.
3.p.9. Staff Action on Approved PD Amendments: Once a PD District is established on the
official zoning map, no building permit shall be issued therein unless the City or County of
Sumter has approved plans and reports for the development as adopted by the City or County
Council, whole or in stages that are deemed satisfactory in relation to the total development.
Upon approval, building permits shall be issued in such manner as for building permits
generally. All plans and reports approved shall be binding on the applicant(s) and any successors
in title so long as the PD zoning is applicable.
3.p.10. Changes in Approved Plans: Minor changes in approved final plans and reports may
be approved by the planning staff only upon findings identical to those required for original
approval. Major changes shall be subject to further amendatory action by the Planning
Commission and City or County Council.

SECTION Q: AIRFIELD COMPATIBILITY (ACD)
DISTRICTS
3.q.1. Purpose: The intent of the ACD is to prevent incompatible land uses or the creation of
flight hazards which would impair the utility and public investment of the Shaw Air Force Base
and the Sumter Airport.
3.q.2. Types of Districts: With the ACD there are several overlay districts which are shown on
the Official Zoning Map(s) as follows:
a. APZ-1, Accident Potential Zone I;
b. APZ-2, Accident Potential Zone II;
c. DNL-1, Day-Night Noise Level Zone I;
d. DNL-2, Day-Night Noise Level Zone II;
e. DNL-3, Day-Night Noise Level Zone III;
f. NA, Noise Attenuation District.
3.q.3. Restrictions Within the Airfield Compatibility Districts: Land designated APZ-1,
APZ-2, DNL-1, DNL-2, or DNL-3 may not be used for any purpose other than those indicated
by Exhibit 7, and under the conditions attached thereto. Property owners or land users should
consult both the text of this Section and the Official Zoning Map to determine the location of
properties in question and the limitations imposed thereon by this Section.
3.q.4. Land Use: The use of land within these zones shall be subject to the following safety and
performance standards and the requirements of Exhibit 3-8. Where permitted uses listed in
Exhibit 3-8 are at variance with the applicable residential or non-residential zoning districts
within which they are proposed, the more restrictive shall apply.
a. Safety Standards  the concentration of persons per use shall be in compliance with
Exhibit 3-7.
1. Maximum Number of Persons  The maximum number of persons per use
shall be a function of the number of hours of operation per day of the use and
shall be expressed on an acre per hour basis. Furthermore, a structure or use
or contiguous structure or use, shall not accommodate a gathering of
individuals, including employees and non-employees, that would result in an
average density of greater than twenty-five (25) persons per acre per hour
during a 24-hour period or that would exceed fifty (50) persons per acre at any
given time.
Such limitations shall be a special condition of the issuance of the building
permit and the certificate of occupancy. The occupant of any such premises
City Zoning and Development Article 3 | 73
Standards Ordinance
January 2014
shall not permit such limitations to be exceeded. The premises shall thereafter
continuously be posted with a form of notice of such limitations, as prescribed
by the Sumter City-County Planning Commission.
2. Concentrations of Persons Per Acre Standard

*Concentrations of persons per acre cannot exceed 50 persons per acre at any time.
Note: Fractions in the maximum persons allowed column are rounded to the lowest whole number.
3. Formula  The maximum persons per acre per hour for the duration of
Time that persons are expected to be on site during a 24-hour period may be
determined as follows:
a. Average densities of persons per hour during a 24-hour period are
determined by calculating the number of persons per acre expected on a
site, multiplying by the number of hours they will be on the site, and
dividing the total by 24.
Example #1: One 8-hour shift of 30 workers on a one (1) acre site.
30 persons expected x 8 hours on site = 240
240 = average density of 10 persons per acre per hour
during a 24-hour period.
Example #2: Two 8-hour shifts of 30 workers on a one (1) acre site.
30 persons expected x 16 hours on site = 480
480 = average density of 20 persons per acre per hour
during a 24-hour period.
City Zoning and Development Article 3 | 74
Standards Ordinance
January 2014
b. The maximum number of persons allowed per acre per hour is calculated
by dividing 24 hours by the number of hours persons will be on the site,
and multiplying the results by 25 persons per acre per hour.
Example #3: A use on a one (1) acre site has two 8-hour shifts.
24 hours x 25 persons = 37.5 maximum
16 hours
3.q.5. Performance Standards: Height and size requirements shall be evaluated in accord with
the Ordinance Regulating the Height of Structures and other Activities in the vicinity of Shaw
Air Force Base, as adopted October 13, 1981.
a. Setbacks: Front 50 feet
Rear 50 feet
Side Interior Side  20 feet
Exterior Side  50 feet
b. Off-Street Parking: Off-street parking for uses within this district shall comply
with Article 8, Section I as appropriate.
3.q.6. Prohibited Uses: All uses indicated by a NO in the applicable sub-zone column of
Exhibit 3-8 are expressly prohibited.
3.q.7. Non-Conforming Uses: The regulations prescribed by this section shall not be construed
to require the removal, lowering of the height or other changes or alteration of any structure or
use not conforming to the regulations as of December 30, 1991, or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of any non-conforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in
the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of
which has begun or plans or residential plats which have been filed in the Planning Commission
Office prior to December 30, 1991.
3.q.8. Permits: Building permits and sign permits shall be required for all construction, in
accordance with Section 1.p.1.
a. Future Uses: Each application for a building permit shall indicate the purpose for
which the permit is desired, with sufficient information to determine whether the
resulting use or structure would conform to the regulations herein prescribed.
b. Existing Uses: Any existing non-conforming use or structure may be replaced,
substantially altered, or rebuilt in accord with the permit requirements in Article Six,
Section A; provided such non-conforming use will not:
1. Create a flight hazard or use not authorized by this Ordinance, or
City Zoning and Development Article 3 | 75
Standards Ordinance
January 2014
2. Permit a non-conforming use or structure to be made or become a greater
hazard to air navigation or less compatible in use than it was on December 30,
1991, or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
3.q.9. Variance Permits: The Sumter City-County Board of Appeals shall have the power to
grant variances to the Safety Requirement Standards and/or the Performance Standards
Regulations of this Section and to authorize the issuance of variance permits therefor as defined
in Article 1, Section H of this Ordinance; provided that the Commander of Shaw Air Force Base,
or his designee, shall be notified of any variance being requested and shall be asked for
comments on such requests.
3.q.10. Other Ordinance: Adoption of this Ordinance shall not invalidate any existing
Ordinance, and shall be used in addition to such Ordinances, such as the Ordinance Regulating
the Height of Structures and other Activities in the Vicinity of Shaw Air Force Base, as adopted
on October 13, 1981.

a. Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses in
order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to
establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this ordinance have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.

adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
b. Findings and Rationale. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the City Council, and on
findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases of City of

A comparative analysis of infractions in Texas alcohol establishments and adult

the City Council finds:
1. Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a
wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and
property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public
indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on
City  Zoning and Development
Standards Ordinance Article 4 | 15
January 2014
surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing
the risk of adverse secondary effects.
2. Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to
minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be
separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects
associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually
oriented businesses in one area.
3. Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the City
has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial
government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is one of the Citys
rationales for this ordinance, exists independent of any comparative analysis
between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the
Citys interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future
secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may
locate in the City. The City finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this
ordinance are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
The City hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to
the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and
reports related to such secondary effects.
4.o.2. Buffer Distance for Sexually Oriented Business in LI-W District: It shall be unlawful to
establish, operate, or cause to be operated a sexually oriented business in the LI-W District unless
the sexually oriented business is at least one thousand (1,000) feet from any dwelling, church or
religious institution, public or private school and/or educational facility, public park or recreational
facility, a residential district (R-15, R-9, R-6. GR, RMF), or any other sexually oriented business.
4.o.3. Buffer Distance for Sexually Oriented Business in HI District: It shall be unlawful to
establish, operate, or cause to be operated a sexually oriented business in the HI District unless the
sexually oriented business is at least seven-hundred-fifty (750) feet from any dwelling, church or
religious institution, public or private school and/or educational facility, public park or recreational
facility, a residential district (R-15, R-9, R-6. GR, RMF), or any other sexually oriented business.
4.o.4. Measurement Method: For the purpose of this section, measurements shall be made in a
straight line in all directions without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest part
of the structure containing the sexually oriented business to the closest point on a property boundary
of any church or religious institution, public or private school and/or educational facility, public
park or recreational facility, a residential district (R-15, R-9, R-6. GR, RMF), or any other sexually
oriented business. Measurements shall be made in a straight line in all directions without regard to

ARTICLE SIX
NONCONFORMING ZONING USES AND SITES
SECTION A: PURPOSE OF ARTICLE AND DEFINITIONS
6.a.1. Purpose: The use of or improvements to real property may become nonconforming when
standards established by this Ordinance change. Specifically, legal nonconforming zoning uses
and legal nonconforming sites (structures and lots) were initially lawful and existed prior to the
adoption of this Ordinance or prior to an amendment hereto but, due to the enactment of this
Ordinance or such amendment, no longer conform to the requirements herein. To the extent that
such nonconforming uses and nonconforming sites have been in continual use, they have been
allowed to remain in use despite the noncompliance with this Ordinance.
The purpose of this Article Six is to allow the continued use and operation of these
nonconforming uses and nonconforming sites pursuant to the requirements of this Article Six.
The goal is not to encourage the persistence of nonconformities, but to ease the burden on
property owners and eventually to ensure that all zoning uses, structures, and lots comply with
the requirements of this Ordinance.
6.a.2. Definitions
a. Development Standards: At any given time, the then-current development
standards applicable to a property or structure pursuant to this Ordinance.
b. Discontinuance: With respect to:
1. Nonconforming Uses, the discontinuance or cessation of operations or
business activity at a structure for a continuous period of not less than six
months;
2. Nonconforming Sites, the discontinuance or cessation of operations or
business activity at a structure for a continuous period of not less than
eighteen months
c. Nonconforming Use: Any use of property that is not a permitted use pursuant to t
he current zoning classification or otherwise is not in compliance with this
Ordinance.
d. Nonconforming Site: Any structure, building, house, shed, accessory dwelling,
or improvement on real property, or any parcel, lot, or unimproved real property,
that does not comply with Development Standards.
e. Project: Any improvement, upfit, renovation, rehabilitation, restoration, removal,
or addition to a structure or lot that occurs after a discontinuance and within
twelve months following the resumption of operations or business activity at such
structure or lot.

Standards Ordinance
January 2014
SECTION B: NONCONFORMING USES
6.b.1. Proof of Legal Nonconformance and Continuance of Use: A Nonconforming Use may
continue to operate pursuant to this Article. The Property Owner or permit Applicant bears the
full burden of proof that any non-conforming situation is a legally established one and has been
in continuous operation. Evidence may include proof of business license, utility statements,
business transition receipts, tax returns, or other documentation. The Zoning Administrator shall
determine whether a situation is a Nonconforming Use as defined in this Article Six. A structural
improvement qualifying as a Nonconforming Use may be increased in size by no more than five
(5%) percent of the gross floor area, if the minimum lot areas, yard setbacks, and off-street
parking requirements of this Ordinance are met.
6.b.2. Loss of Nonconforming Use Status. If a Nonconforming Use is subject to a
Discontinuance, then any subsequent use or operation must be in full compliance with all
applicable zoning requirements in this Ordinance.
6.b.3. Accidental Destruction. If a Nonconforming Use is discontinued due to fire or other
natural causes, the Nonconforming Use may be reestablished within six months after the fire or
other natural cause..
SECTION C: NONCONFORMING SITES
6.c.1. Proof of Legal Nonconformance and Continuance: A Nonconforming Site may
continue to operate pursuant to this article. The Property Owner or permit Applicant bears the
full burden of proof that any Nonconforming Site is a legally established one and has continually
operated. Evidence may include proof of business license, utility statements, business transition
receipts, tax returns or other documentation. The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether
a situation is a legally Nonconforming Site as defined in this Article Six.
6.c.2. Loss of Legal Nonconforming Site Status: If a Nonconforming Site is subject to a
Discontinuance then any subsequent reuse, inhabitance, operation, or activity must be in

subdivision and/or a major site plan shall confer upon the applicant the following rights:
a. The approval of the preliminary plat or site plan constitutes approval of the
subdivision or the land development as to its character, intensity of development,
general lay-out, and the approximate dimensions of streets, lots, and other planned
features. Such approval binds the developer to the general scheme of the subdivision
or land development, and permits the subdivider or developer to proceed with the
installation of site improvements, subject to obtaining other necessary permits;
b. The preliminary plat or site plan must be approved in its entirety or in phases as
shown on the plat and does not constitute approval of the final plat or cause the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy; and accordingly, does not authorize the sale of
lot(s) or the occupancy or use of a parcel of land;

filed by the developer with the Sumter County Deeds Office and mapped by the
Sumter County Assessors Office. The Planning Commission for good cause shown,
may extend the period not to exceed one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date
of signing of the plat.
e. Guarantees and Signature of the Planning Commission Chairman: The signature
of the Chairman of the Planning Commission shall not be affixed until the developer
has posted the guarantees required pursuant to 7.d.8. or 7.d.9.

Standards Ordinance Article 7 | 8
January 2014
7.d.7. Effect of Final Approval of A Major Subdivision and/or Site Plan:
a. The final approval of the land development plan or subdivision plat shall not
automatically constitute or effect an acceptance by the City of Sumter or the County
of Sumter of the dedication of any street, utility easement, infrastructure facility, or
other public ground shown upon the final plat or site plan. Public acceptance of the
lands must be by action of the City Council or County Council. Sumter City Council
will not accept streets in gated communities and from small business parks with
extended driveways.
b. The developer shall be responsible for the submission of the required paperwork in
order for the City or the County to consider accepting ownership of infrastructure or
public ground. In this regard, the developer shall submit a Warranty Deed of

Commission is required to suspend Building Permits and/or inspections for a major
subdivision, a written notice of the suspension will be provided to the developer as
soon as possible. The notice shall include the agency directing the suspensions so the
developer may contact them ASAP and any information they may have provided to
the Planning Commission. If the Planning commission requires the suspension, the
notice will include the reason, required action to remedy the problem and if
appropriate, a time frame to comply before the suspension takes effect. The
suspension will be released upon notice by the requesting agency.
7.d.8. Maintenance Guarantee:
a. In order to assure the satisfactory condition of completed improvements (i.e., water
delivery system, sewerage disposal system, and road system) the developer at the
time of final subdivision plat approval shall post a Maintenance Guarantee. The
Maintenance Guarantee shall be equal to fifteen (15%) percent of the estimated cost
of the improvements as determined by the City Engineer or the County Engineer.
b. The Maintenance Guarantee shall be in the form of a letter of credit, surety bond,
certified check, or other instruments readily convertible to cash. The letter of credit
shall expire twenty-four (24) months from the approval of the final subdivision plat
by the City or County of Sumter;
c. The Maintenance Guarantee shall be released twenty-four (24) months after posting
unless the City Engineer or the County Engineer determines that there is work to be
done;
City Zoning and Development
Standards Ordinance Article 7 | 9
January 2014
d. If such a determination is made, the City Engineer or the County Engineer shall
notify the developer of the deficiencies, and the developer shall be given sixty (60)
days to complete the work aimed at correcting the deficiencies. If the work is not
completed, the proceeds from the Maintenance Guarantee shall be used by the City or
County for such work. The balance of the Maintenance Guarantee (if any) shall be
released when the City Engineer or the County Engineer deems the work has been
satisfactorily completed, and the City or the County has been reimbursed for any and
all expenses incurred.
7.d.9. Performance Guarantee:
a. A Performance Guarantee may be required and / or used in two different scenarios.
1. Its primary use would be if all the improvements (infrastructure) approved
by the Sumter City-County Planning Commission as part of the
Preliminary Plat are not properly installed and constructed in accordance
with the required standards in Appendix B prior to the submission of the
Final Plat for approval either due to weather or other acts of God, a
Performance Guarantee may be entered into with the developer /
subdivider.
2. The other use of a Performance Guarantee would be when the developer
desires to expedite Final Plat approval and Council enters into the
agreement to allow construction of all required improvements
(infrastructure) after the final plat is approved, lots are sold, and
construction is started.
b. In either case, the Performance Guarantee will be a binding agreement between the
Council and developer / subdivider. The agreement will be accompanied by an
irrevocable financial instrument (Letter of Credit, Bond, or other instrument
acceptable to Council) in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five percent
(125%) of the cost of the required improvements (unfinished for (1) above and all
for (2) above) as certified by the City Engineer or Manager to enter into a
Performance Guarantee with the developer / subdivider.
c. The Performance Guarantee must be accepted by the Council and must include a
specific, reasonable, and satisfactory date for the completion of the necessary
improvements. In no case shall a Performance Guarantee be accepted for more than
two (2) years. The date for completion will be at least three (3) months prior to the
expiration of the financial instrument accepted by the Council.
d. When the improvements have been completed and approved for conformity with the
regulations and Appendix B, and accepted by the Council with the appropriate
Maintenance Guarantee, the financial instrument and Performance Guarantee shall
be released and returned.
City Zoning and Development
Standards Ordinance Article 7 | 10
January 2014
e. In the event the developer/ subdivider fails to construct the required improvements
and have them accepted in the time accepted by the Council, the Performance
Guarantee and financial instrument shall be forfeited to the City to be used for the
completion of the improvements. A Performance Guarantee will initially be
accepted for a maximum time of two (2) years. That time frame and its associated
financial instrument may only be extended by the Council after a demonstrated
hardship shown by the developer / subdivider.
f. The successful conclusion of the Performance Guarantee shall include the automatic
initiation of the Maintenance Guarantee and Council action to accept the
improvements.
g. Building permits may be issued during the Performance Guarantee process provided
the Final Plat has been approved and recorded and proper applications with required
fees has been submitted. However, no Certificate of Occupancy (CO) shall be
issued until all the improvements are in place, accepted by the Council, and
Maintenance Guarantee is in place. This provision applies to all construction
including commercial and residential.
7.d.10 Traffic Study for Development Applications:
a. The Traffic Impact Study shall be submitted at the time of subdivision and/or site
plan application(s) for development project(s) that meet(s) the following threshold.
Consistent with SCDOT ARMS Chapter 6 (Traffic Impact Studies), any development
that generates more than 100 vehicle trips during the peak hours of the day requires a
submission of a Traffic Impact Study (TIS). Vehicle trip is defined as a trip to either
exit or enter into the development site and is counted as one (1) trip. In addition,
certain land use categories that may expect to generate at least 100 peak hour trips
during the peak hours of the day are required to submit a TIS in accordance with
Table 1 below:
TABLE 1: GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING THE NEED FOR AN IMPACT STUDY
Land Use 100 Peak Hour Trips*

Manufacturing Plant (GFA) 144,000 sq. ft.
*Rates/Equations used to calculate above thresholds are for the P.M. Peak hour of the
adjacent street.
In some instances, thresholds for rural areas and small cities may need to be lower than
for urban areas.
b. The Zoning Administrator may waive a Traffic Impact Study (or elements thereof)
stated in subsection a" above on a case by case basis when the applicant shows that
the proposed developments impact on adjacent roads and intersections will be
minimal and insignificant, or will be no greater than those projected by a traffic
impact analysis prepared and submitted within the past two years for the same site
under the same similar background conditions. The Zoning Administrator must
document the reasons for the waiver.
c. If a TIS is required, a hard copy must be filed together with any other paper work
that may be required when a development application is submitted. An electronic
copy may be filed only by the permission of the Zoning Administrator. The TIS
must be prepared and signed by a person with a Professional Engineer (PE) license
issued by the State of South Carolina.
d. The Zoning Administrator should be contacted before preparing the TIS to discuss
the requirements and determine the scope of the study. The following information
is required to be contained in TIS:
1. Study Area  Description of the study area including surrounding land uses
and expected development in the vicinity that would influence future traffic
conditions. The study area shall include the intersections immediately
adjacent to the development and those identified by the Zoning Administrator.
These intersections may include those not immediately adjacent to the
development if significant site traffic could be expected to impact the
intersection. If intersections impacted by the development are within a
coordinated traffic signal system, then the entire system shall be analyzed. If
the signal system is very large, a portion of the system may be analyzed if
approved by the Zoning Administrator. A study area site map showing the
site location is required.
2. Proposed Land Use  Description of the current and proposed land use
including characteristics such as the number and type of dwelling units, gross
and leasable floor area, number of employees, accompanied with a complete
project site plan (with buildings identified as to proposed use). A schedule for
construction of the development and proposed development stages should also
be included.
City Zoning and Development
Standards Ordinance Article 7 | 12
January 2014
3. Existing Conditions  Description of existing traffic conditions including
existing peak-hour traffic volumes adjacent to the site and levels of service for
intersections in the vicinity which are expected to be impacted. Existing
traffic signal timings should be used. In general, AM and PM peak hour
counts should be used, but on occasion other peak periods may need to be
counted to determine the effects of school or special event traffic. In some
cases, pedestrian counts will be required. Data should be adjusted for daily
and seasonal variations. Existing counts may be used if taken within 12
months of the submittal of the TIS. In most cases, counts should be taken
when school is in session unless otherwise determined by the Zoning
Administrator. Other information that may be required as determined by the
Zoning Administrator may include, but is not limited to, crash data, stopping
sight distances, and 50th and 85th percentile speeds.
4. Future Background Growth  Estimate of future background traffic growth.
If the planned completion date for the project or the last phase of the project is
beyond 1 year of the study, an estimate of background traffic growth for the
adjacent street network shall be made and included in the analysis. In general,
the growth factor will be determined from local or statewide data. Also
included, is the state, local, or private transportation improvement projects in
the project study area that will be underway in the build-out year and traffic
that is generated by other proposed developments in the study area.
5. Estimate of trip generation  The site forecasted trips should be based on the
most recent edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. A table should be
provided in the report outlining the categories and quantities of land uses, with
the corresponding trip generation rates or equations, and the resulting number
of trips. The reason for using the rate or equation should be documented. For
large developments that will have multiple phases, the table should be divided
based on the trip generation for each phase. Any reductions due to internal trip
capture and pass-by trips, transit use, and transportation demand management
should be justified and documented. All trip generation and trip reduction
calculations and supporting documentation shall be included in the report
appendix.
6. Trip Distribution and Traffic Assignment  The distribution (inbound versus
outbound, left turn versus right turn) of the estimated trip generation to the
adjacent street network and nearby intersections shall be included in the report
and the basis should be explained. The distribution percentages with the
corresponding volumes should be provided in a graphical format.
7. Analysis and Estimate of Impact  A capacity analysis should be performed
at each of the study intersections and access intersection locations (signalized
and unsignalized) in the vicinity of the development. Intersection analysis
shall include LOS determination for all approaches and movements. The
levels of service will be based on the procedures in the latest edition of
City Zoning and Development
Standards Ordinance Article 7 | 13
January 2014
Transportation Research Boards Highway Capacity Manual. Coordination
analysis will be required for the signal systems or portion of the signal
systems analyzed.
8. Access Management Standards  The report shall include a map and
description of the proposed access including any sight distance limitations,
adjacent driveways and intersections, and a demonstration that the number of
driveways proposed is the fewest necessary and that they provide safe and
efficient traffic operations.
9. Traffic signalization  If a traffic signal is being proposed, a signal warrant
analysis shall be included in the study. The approval of a traffic signal on
projected volumes may be deferred until volumes meet warrants given in the
MUTCD. The developer should make any lane improvements during
construction so that if in the horizon year a signal is warranted, one may be
installed with little impact to the intersection.
10. Mitigation and alternatives - The traffic impact study should include
proposed improvements or access management techniques that will mitigate
falling in the levels of service below C which is considered as acceptable
operating speed in urban conditions.
In areas where baseline, or existing, levels of service are at or below Level of
Service C, the baseline level of service shall be maintained or improved after
development. If the baseline Level of Service is F and the location is in a
congested area, the ZONING ADMINISTRATOR and/or PLANNING
COMMISSION shall determine any required mitigation. The baseline level of
service shall include all committed (funded) road improvements and all nonsite
traffic, but exclude the traffic to be generated by the new development.
The Zoning Administrator and/or the Planning Commission will be
responsible for final determination of mitigation improvements required to be
constructed by the applicant, in conjunction with SCDOT Staff, as
appropriate.
e. The following checklist is used by the Planning Department in the review process
and can aid in the preparation of TIS. This checklist shows the minimum
requirements for a traffic impact study to be complete and does not certify or
guarantee adequacy or approval. The Zoning Administrator may require additional
requirements during the review process, or during the initial meeting with the
developer.

f. The internal design criteria for projects defined in 7.d.5 and 7.d.6 shall observe the
following:
1. Streets, drives, parking, and service areas shall be for safe and convenient
access for service and emergency vehicles. Streets shall be laid out to not
encourage outside traffic to traverse the development or create
unnecessary fragmentation of the project into small blocks. In general, the
project shall be consistent with uses and shape of the site and convenience
and safety of occupants and persons frequenting the project.
2. Vehicular access to collector and arterial streets or portions of streets from
off-street parking and service areas shall be so combined, limited, located,
designed, and controlled as to channel traffic to and from such areas
conveniently, safely, and in a manner that minimize traffic friction and
promotes free flow of traffic or streets without excessive interruption.
g. The external criteria for projects defined in 7.d.5 and 7.d.6. shall observe the
following:
1. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to encourage smooth
traffic flow with controlled turning movement and minimize hazards to
vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Merging and turning lanes and/or traffic
dividers shall be required where existing or anticipated heavy flows
indicate need.
2. Such projects shall not be permitted access to a local street, buy may
border or front on such a street
3. Pedestrian access, where provided, shall be by safe and convenient routes.
Where there are crossings or pedestrian ways an vehicular routes at edges
of the project, such crossings shall be safely located, marked, and
controlled; and where such ways are exposed to substantial automotive
traffic, safeguards including fencing may be required to prevent crossings
except at designated points.
4. Driveway design must follow the AASHTO (A Policy on Geometric
Design of Highways and Streets, Greenbook 2004) guidelines:
Driveways are, in effect, intersections and should be designed consistent
with their intended use. Ideally, driveways should not be located within
the functional area of a roadway intersection or in the influence area of an
adjacent driveway. The functional area extends both upstream and
downstream from the physical intersection area and includes the
longitudinal limits of auxiliary lanes.
Chapter 3 (Driveways) of SCDOT ARMS shall be used as the
guidelines for designing driveways for access.
City Zoning and Development
Standards Ordinance Article 7 | 16
January 2014
h. To measure the relative impact of major subdivisions or site plans on the road
network adjacent to such projects, the service levels of the affected streets shall be
investigated.
1. The level of service for streets and roads is defined (according to the 1985
Highway Capacity Manual) in terms of vehicular delay. Delay is a measure of
driver time. Varied and complex factors contributing to delay include
intersection geometry, frequency of curb cuts, traffic volumes, signalization
and cycle length, etc. The quantitative measurements (delays in seconds
per vehicle) are defined in the chapters of signalized intersections
(Chapter 16) and of unsignalized intersections (Chapter 17).
2. The various levels of service are classified A through F, depending on the
delay factor and the traffic conditions as follows:
LEVEL OF SERVICE A LEVEL OF SERVICE D
* Free flow conditions *High density, but stable flow
*Low volumes * Restricted speeds
*Little or no delays * Noticeable delays at signals
*Uninterrupted flow * Little freedom to maneuver
*No restriction on maneuverability
*Drivers maintain desired speed LEVEL OF SERVICE E
*Low, but relatively uniform operating speeds
LEVEL OF SERVICE B *Volumes at or near capacity
*Stable flow conditions *Approaching unacceptable delays at signals
*Operating speeds beginning to be restricted
LEVEL OF SERVICE F
LEVEL OF SERVICE C *Forced flow conditions
* Stable flow but speed and maneuverability
restricted by higher traffic volumes
*Stop and go operation
*Satisfactory operating speed for urban
conditions
*Volumes below capacity may be zero
*Some delays at signals *Average vehicle delay at signals is grater
than one minute
i. Application of Standards: All proposed major subdivisions or Site Plans shall be
evaluated by the Zoning Administrator on the basis of their internal and external
relationships, particularly as they impact surrounding street service levels. Where
data calculations indicate that a proposed project will create a lower than level of
service C for streets and roads in the City of Sumter or Sumter County said projects
shall be mitigated to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator, or referred to the
Planning Commission for review. Mitigation may also be required when a project
impacts the transportation network through a level of service reduction, even if
it does not create a lower than level of service C.
City Zoning and Development
Standards Ordinance Article 7 | 17
January 2014
j. Review by the Sumter City-County Planning Commission when referred to the
Planning Commission, the Commission may consult the South Carolina Department
of Highways and Public Transportation, and other local and regional agencies
involved in matters of transportation. No section of this regulation is meant to
overrule or supersede SC DOT required mitigation when State requirements are
more stringent than the local authority.
The review of the Commission may result in: 1) required modifications to the
proposed use; 2) required modifications to the internal and/or external road network
serving and impacted by the proposed use; 3) mitigation required through additional
right-of-way, signalization, on-site improvements; off-site improvements; limiting
frontage and access; or 4) denial with stated reasons for denial.
SECTION E: EFFECT OF FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
(S.C. Code Section 6-29-1190)
7.e.1 Final plat approval for all subdivision of property shall confer upon the applicant the
following rights:
1. To record the plat in the Sumter County Register of Deeds Office.
2. To proceed with the sale and/or transfer of lots and parcels in accord with the
approved and recorded plat.
SECTION F: SPECIFICATIONS OF DOCUMENTS TO BE SUBMITTED
7.f.1. Purpose: The documents to be submitted are intended to provide the Sumter City-County
Planning Commission with sufficient information and data to assure compliance with all Zoning
and Development Standards Ordinance requirements. The specification of documents to be
submitted is based on the type of development and the particular stage of development that a site

SECTION C: OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION
8.c.1. Purpose: Planned Development Districts shall be required to provide open space. Two
categories of open space are identified in this Ordinance i.e., developed open space or
undeveloped open space. Developed open space shall be designed to provide active/or passive
recreation facilities. Undeveloped open space shall be designed to preserve important site
amenities and environmentally sensitive area (See 8.b.2.c for a description of areas to be
preserved as undeveloped open space).
8.c.2. Minimum Requirements:
a. Amount of Open space Required: Twenty-five (25%) percent of the tract proposed
for a Planned Development (PD) shall be set aside for developed and/or undeveloped
open space, adjusted, as appropriate, for the conditions such as population density,
existing municipal or county facilities located nearby, socio-economic characteristics
of the prospective population, and other appropriate site and development-specific
factors.
b. Size of Open Space Parcels: The area of each parcel of open space designed for
active recreational purposes shall be of such minimum dimensions as to be
functionally usable.
c. Location of Open Space Parcels: Open space parcels in residential PDs shall be
convenient to the dwelling units they are intended to serve. However, because of
noise generation, they shall be sited with sensitivity to surrounding development.
8.c.3. Improvement of Open Space Parcels:
a. Developed Open space: The Planning Commission may require the installation of
recreation facilities, taking into consideration:
1. The physical character of the available open space land;
2. The estimated age and the recreational needs of persons likely to reside in the
development;
City  Zoning and Development Article 8 | 4
Standards Ordinance
January 2014
3. Proximity, nature, and capacity of existing public recreation facilities.
b. Undeveloped Open Space: As a general principle, undeveloped open space should
be left in its natural state. A developer may make certain improvements such as the
cutting of trails for walking or jogging, or the provision of picnic areas, etc. The
Planning Commission may require a developer to make other improvements, such as
removing dead or diseased trees, thinning trees, or other vegetation to encourage
more desirable growth, and grading and seeding.
8.c.4. Exceptions to the Standards: The Sumter City-County Planning Commission may
permit minor deviations from the open space standards when it can be determined that:
a. The objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to
them.
b. Because of peculiarities in the tract of land, it would be unreasonable to require strict
adherence to the standards.
8.c.5. Deed Restrictions: Any lands dedicated for open space purposes shall contain appropriate
covenants and deed restrictions approved by the City or the County Attorney ensuring that:
a. The open space area will not be further subdivided in the future;
b. The use of the open space will continue in perpetuity for the purpose specified;
c. Appropriate provisions will be made for the maintenance of the open space.
8.c.6. Open Space Ownership: The type of ownership of land dedicated for open space
purposes shall be selected by the owner, developer, or subdivider, subject to the approval of the
Sumter City-County Planning Commission. The type of ownership may include, but is not
necessarily limited to, the following:
a. The City of Sumter or Sumter County, subject to the acceptance by the Mayor and
City Council, or the County Council;
b. Homeowners, condominium, or cooperative associations or organizations;
c. Shared, undivided interest by all property owners in the development;
d. Individually owned.
8.c.7. Homeowners Association: If the open space is owned and maintained by a homeowners
or condominium association, the developer shall file with the City or the County Attorney a copy
of the covenants and restrictions that will govern the association at the time of the site plan
approval or the preliminary plat application stage. The provisions shall include, but may not be
limited to, the following:
City  Zoning and Development Article 8 | 5

Standards Ordinance Article 8 | 45
January 2014
SECTION I: PARKING REGULATIONS
8.i.1. Purpose: The provisions of this section apply wherever off-street parking is required by
this Ordinance as identified in 8.i.3.n. for residential parking and Exhibit 8-9 for non-residential
parking. The exception to the requirement for off-street parking is only found within the CBD
District.
8.i.2. General Provisions: These regulations are designed to:
a. Establish the required numbers of off-street parking places and the design for parking
lots together with ingress and egress standards;
b. Require parking provisions whenever buildings or uses increase in size or capacity,
enlarge in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating
capacity, or otherwise create a need for additional parking when the need increases by
ten (10%) percent over the number of existing spaces;
c. Conserve land utilization rates by taking into account compact cars through a twenty
(20%) percent allowance given for smaller cars within the total number of required
spaces, provided that such compact car spaces be clearly identified on the site plan
and on the actual site after construction;
8.i.3. Design Requirements:
a. Definition: For the purpose of these regulations an off-street parking space is an all
weather dust free surface area, not in a street or alley, permanently reserved for the
temporary storage of one automobile and connected with a street or alley by an allweather
dust free surface driveway which affords ingress and egress.
b. Surfacing, Drainage and Maintenance: Off-street parking facilities shall be
properly graded for drainage to prevent damage to abutting property and/or public
streets and alleys. Parking lots shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, or other
surfaces approved by the Sumter City-County Planning commission. Off street
parking lots shall include concrete curbs and gutters, maintained in a clean, orderly
and dust-free condition, and not used for the sale, repair or the dismantling or
servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies. (Note: For places of
Worship (SIC 866) that only use their facilities a maximum of two days per week, the
required parking spots do not have to be paved, and curb and gutter is not required.
Any additional use beyond two days per week requires full compliance with the
above paragraph.)
c. Entrances and Exits: All parking lots shall be designed so that all exiting
movements onto a street are in a forward motion. Entrances and exit driveways to
streets and alleys in the vicinity of street intersections must be located at least twentyfive
(25 ft) feet, measured along the curb line, from the intersection.
City Zoning & Development
Standards Ordinance Article 8 | 46
January 2014
d. Parking spaces: A standard car off-street parking space shall be not less than nine
by nineteen (9 x 19ft) feet, and a compact car off-street parking space shall be not
less than eight by sixteen (8x16ft) feet in size.
e. Width of Aisles: Providing direct access to individual parking spaces shall be in
accordance with the requirements specified below:
EXHIBIT 8-7
GUIDELINES FOR PARKING LOT AISLES
Parking Angle (Degree) Aisle Width (Feet)
30 12
45 13
60 18
90 25
f. Location on Other Property: If the required number of off-street parking spaces
cannot be provided as required in Exhibit 8-9 on the same lot with the principal use,
such spaces may be provided on other off-street property under the same ownership,
or on other property rented or leased, provided such property lies within four hundred
(400 ft) feet walking distance of the main entrance to such principal use. A written
agreement specifying the joint use arrangement of parking spaces shall be filed with
the application for a building permit.
g. Common Off-street Parking Areas: Two or more principal uses may utilize a
common area in order to comply with off-street parking requirements; provided that
the total number of spaces is not less than the sum of the spaces required for the
individual uses as separately computed in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance. Also, the owner of the parking lot shall relinquish his development rights
over the property until such time as additional parking is provided elsewhere.
h. Curb Cuts: Ingress and egress openings (i.e., curb cuts) shall not be less than ten (10
ft) feet from residential uses or more than thirty (30 ft) feet in width. Only one curb
cut shall be permitted on lots less than one hundred fifty (150 ft) feet of frontage. No
more than two (2) curb cuts per lot shall be permitted except in commercial or
industrial districts where two (2) shall be permitted on each street upon which the lot
fronts.
i. Access Points Near Highway Interchanges: In no case shall any curb cut, point of
access or other means of vehicular ingress and/or egress from private property be
permitted closer than two hundred (200 ft) feet to the intersecting point of the street
right-of-way line and within the right-of-way line of any portion of an interchange,
involving grade separation with that road and any limited access highway. Involved
in this requirement is the interchange itself for a limited access highway including all
ramps, acceleration and deceleration lanes, merge lanes, and other facilities
City Zoning & Development
Standards Ordinance Article 8 | 47
January 2014
specifically designed to facilitate traffic movement onto and off of a limited access
highway.
j. Parking Spaces for the Physically Handicapped: When off-street parking is
required for any non-residential use, parking for the handicapped shall be included
when calculating the overall parking requirements for a building or use, based on the
following formula:
EXHIBIT 8-8
HANDICAPPED PARKING REQUIREMENTS
Number of Spaces
Number of Reserved for
Required Spaces Handicapped Persons
Up to 25 1

with concrete or asphalt.
k. Buffering and Landscaping: All parking areas except those in the CBD and
individual residential zoned lots, shall be required to comply with Article Nine.
l. Approval of Parking Lot Design and Layout: Design and plans for off-street
parking and loading zones shall be subject to the approval of the Zoning
Administrator. The plans for parking lots shall show in detail the engineering and
developmental details as to demonstrate the compliance to the standards in this
Ordinance;
m. Off-Street Loading: All uses shall provide off-street loading areas sufficient for their
requirements. Such space shall be arranged so that no vehicle being loaded or
unloaded in connection with normal operations shall stand in or project into a public
street, walk, alley, or private street, or obstruct ingress and egress to the site. Off
City Zoning & Development
Standards Ordinance Article 8 | 48
January 2014
street loading and unloading areas shall in all cases be located on the same lot or
parcel of land as the structures they are intended to serve.
n. Off-Street Residential Parking: Parking requirements for all residential uses except
those in the CBD area as follows:
1 Bedroom Unit: 1.5 spaces
2 or more Bedroom Unit: 2 spaces
Exceptions: Urban Multi-Family Apartments shall provide, at minimum, 1
space per rental unit regardless of bedroom count. Within the CBD, developers
may request a lesser standard from the Sumter City Council.
o. Refuse Receptacles to Include Cigarette Disposal Units: All uses with parking lots
shall provide refuse receptacles including cigarette disposal units within the parking
area or at entrances to adjacent building at a rate of one receptacle for every 100
parking spaces, or fraction thereof. Such receptacles shall be weighted or attached to
the ground as necessary to prevent spillage. It shall be the responsibility of the owner
or manager of the parking lot to collect the refuse and trash deposited in such
containers and store this material in an approved location for collection.

7. Existing trees may be counted in meeting the number of required trees for street
landscaping and buffers. To be counted, a tree must have a tree diameter at breast
height (DBH) of two inches.
8. Significant Trees (per Table 9-2) may be removed during land disturbance and/or
construction only if the landscape plan mitigates each trees removal with the addition
of two (2) replacement trees of an equivalent species that will grow to an equal size at
maturity. Replacement trees shall meet the minimum planting specifications of this
ordinance at the time of planting. Replacement trees shall not count towards
buffering, street tree or other landscape planting requirements.
9. In parking lots, curb and gutter systems shall be installed around the CRZ of existing
trees to maintain a protective area after construction. Soil amendments and mulch
shall be applied to refill areas where soil removal and root pruning have taken place;
10. Permeable paving, asphalt or concrete as well as tree grates, structural soils, and other
engineered products which allow water to penetrate the soil underneath the tree are
permitted within the outer CRZ area. Sidewalks and other hardscape elements with
permeable qualities are permitted in outer CRZ areas. When installing such elements,
tree roots shall be pruned with clean cuts at the edge of the disturbed area and shall
not compromise more than 25% of the outer CRZ area. No fill shall be placed above
grade, and no disturbance, parking of heavy machinery or planting is permitted within
the Inner CRZ area of a tree. (See graphic entitled Critical Root Zone of a Tree in
definitions Section 9.c.2)
11. No planting other than groundcover is to occur within the outer CRZ of an existing
significant and/or historic tree being retained on site;
12. Trees and undergrowth in designated open space in an approved plan shall remain
undisturbed except as indicated on an approved plan. Removal of any dead and dying
plant, or any plant currently listed on the USDA Invasive and Noxious Weed List is
permitted;

c. A Land Disturbance Permit shall be required for all major subdivisions, commercial and
industrial projects occupying undeveloped and/or developed property, or portions
thereof.
1. Owner occupied individual residential properties and on-going farm operations
are expressly excluded from the provisions herein;
2. An application for a Land Disturbance Permit shall be available from the Planning
Department. The issuance of a Land Disturbance Permit is contingent upon the
approval of a Tree Protection Plan except in single-family or duplex residential
parcels;
d. Tree Removal: A permit shall be required for the removal or destruction of a significant
or historic tree or trees. A permit may be issued by the Zoning Administrator if it meets
the following criteria:
1. The significant and/or historic tree(s) to be removed is dead, diseased, irreparably
damaged, hazardous or creating or potentially creating damage to the property or
injury to person;
City Zoning & Development Article 9 | 19
Standards Ordinance
January 2014
2. An approved landscape plan and tree protection plan have been approved
pursuant to this ordinance;
3. Any tree in good health that is greater than 30 DBH will be considered a
Historic Tree and cannot be removed without a signed letter from a licensed
arborist, stating that the tree is dead, diseased, irreparably damaged, hazardous or
creating or potentially creating damage to the property or injury to person;
4. No person, firm, organization, society, association or corporation, or any agent or
representative thereof shall directly or indirectly destroy or remove any significant
or historic tree situated on property under the jurisdiction of this Section without a
Land Disturbance Permit. A permit for tree removal is not required for trees
on established single family or duplex residential parcels;
5. It is Councils intent that this Ordinance not render any parcel impractical for its
permitted or conditionally allowed uses. In instances where an Historic Tree must
be removed because the historic tree is located within a proposed building
footprint, street, road, driveway, drainage way, or parking area and no other
reasonable design or economically reasonable alternative exists to save the tree,
removal shall be mitigated by the planting of two (2) recommended trees of an
equivalent species to the tree(s) being removed.
9.d.4. Replacement of Dead, Dying, and Damaged Vegetation.
a. The damage, failure to thrive, and/or intentional removal of any landscaped area or
vegetation required by this section shall constitute a violation of the Zoning Ordinance. All
disturbed landscaped areas and vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with the
approved landscape plan or in accordance with an agreed upon mitigation plan approved by
the Zoning Administrator.
b. Upon notification by the Zoning Administrator, dead or dying plant materials required by an
approved landscape/buffering plan shall be replaced by the current property owner(s) or
legally responsible party. Failure to act within 30 days of notice by the Zoning
Administrator will constitute a zoning violation.
c. Emergencies: In the case of emergencies such as windstorms, ice storms, fire, or other
disasters, the Zoning Administrator may waive the requirements of this ordinance during the
emergency period so that the requirements of this ordinance will in no way hamper work to
restore order. This shall not be interpreted as a general waiver of the intent of this
ordinance. A period of one year shall be granted following such an emergency, for the
requirements of the ordinance to be met;
9.d.5. Revisions to Approved Plans: Due to seasonal planting problems and/or lack of plant
availability, approved landscape plans may require minor revisions. In instances where planting
is delayed by weather or other factors, a written request for planting extensions shall be provided
to the Zoning Administrator indicating a finite date for final installation. Minor revisions to
City Zoning & Development Article 9 | 20
Standards Ordinance
January 2014
planting plans may be approved by the Zoning Administrator so long as the plan does not violate
any part of this ordinance.
9.d.6. Waivers: A waiver of the landscaping requirements may be requested of the Zoning
Administrator. The waiver request shall be in writing and include a detailed justification in
support of the request. Waiver requests shall be judged on their ability to provide an alternative
design which meets the public purpose to at least an equivalent degree.
SECTION E: RECOMMENDED PLANTS
9.e.1. Recommended Trees: The following list contains those plant materials which are native
to the Sumter area or have been determined to be suitable for the climate of the Sumter area.
Applicants seeking landscape plan approval are encouraged but not required to select plant
materials from the following plant list. The Zoning Administrator may consult an arborist, the
South Carolina Urban Tree Species Guide, SCDOT Tree Guide, or any other industry
recognized source for more information.

standards for the easement shall then become the same as those for a
Rural Community Driveway as set forth in section 8.e.2. including
specifically subsection 8.e.2.i. unless compliance with that specific
subsection is impossible due to the width of the original easement and
the inability of the disqualifying grantor to obtain the necessary travel
way width for the benefit of the disqualifying grantee. To ensure
compliance with this subsection section, and deed for property which
constitutes an exempt subdivision under this subsection shall contain the
following language: This property is subject to restrictions found in the
Sumter County Subdivision Ordinance of December 14, 1999 under the
