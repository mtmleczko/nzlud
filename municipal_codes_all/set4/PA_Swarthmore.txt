   WHEREAS, the codification and general revision of such ordinances, together
with the new matter to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be

affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in the
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

from his property trees and shrubs afflicted with Dutch elm or any other
disease which threatens to injure or destroy plants, shrubs and shade trees
anywhere in the Borough. Upon the failure of such owner to comply with such
notice, the Borough may cause the work to be done and may levy and collect the
cost thereof from such owner by the filing of a Municipal lien or by an action
in assumpsit as provided by law.
   The Tree Committee may also require property owners to trim or remove any
trees, bushes or shrubs which encroach upon or interfere with the safe use of a
street or sidewalk or any dead or decaying tree which constitutes a danger to
the public or to private property in the vicinity. 
(Ord. 720. Passed 9-13-71. )

   (a)   The Tree Committee shall have the power to investigate the condition
of the shade trees in the Borough, particularly those planted within the lines
of the streets and highways thereof, and to make recommendations from time to
time to Council with reference to the proper care thereof and additional
planting as the same may be required. Council may, from time to time, authorize
the Committee to take appropriate action and make appropriate expenditures in
specific cases to purchase, plant, conserve, care for and foster such shade
trees. The Committee, however, shall have no power to incur any expense of any
kind whatsoever or execute any contracts unless in each instance Council has
given prior consent thereto by motion or resolution.
   (b)   Such action by Council and such expenditures by Council are voluntary
acts that shall not limit, ameliorate or change the obligation of the property
owner to trim or remove any trees, bushes, or shrubs which encroach upon or
interfere with the safe use of a street or sidewalk or any dead or decaying
tree which constitutes a danger to the public or to private property.
(Ord. 798. Passed 8-11-80.)
266.06  RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRIVATE PARTIES.

authorities, corporations or individuals residing or functioning in the
Borough, with reference to the planting, trimming and care of trees and shrubs
on private property.
(Ord. 340. Passed 4-21-32.)
266.07  CARING FOR STREET TREES.
   (a)   No person shall plant, transplant, injure, trim, spray or remove any
tree or shrub located within the right-of-way lines of streets without prior
written authorization of the Tree Committee or its duly designated agent, the
Borough Manager. On a voluntary basis, without any legal requirements to do so
and without legal obligation to continue with such a voluntary program, the
Council may, from time to time, as finances and circumstances shall permit,
take appropriate action and make appropriate expenditures to do any or all of
the following:
      (1)   To conduct a periodic inspection of the trees and shrubs planted
within the lines of the streets and highways;
      (2)   To take emergency action to trim or remove any trees, bushes or
shrubs which encroach upon or interfere with the safe use of a street or
sidewalk, or any dead or decaying tree which constitutes a danger to the public
or to private property; and
      (3)   To let bids and make contracts to purchase, plant, conserve, care
for and foster such shade trees within the lines of the streets and highways
within the Borough or any portion thereof.
   (b)   It is expressly intended that the cost of caring for the shade trees
in the Borough, to include those planted within the lines of the streets and
highways thereof, shall be the responsibility of the property owner. Any
voluntary action taken by the Borough, pursuant to this chapter, with respect
to shade trees planted within the lines of the streets and highways thereof,
shall not create any obligations on the part of the Borough to continue such
action, nor shall it limit, ameliorate or change the obligation of the
landowner.

280.01  INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   Purpose. The Borough Council has found and concluded that the
following provisions will tend to attract competent officials and employees by
removing the threat of loss or damage from legal harassment while engaged in
municipal service, resulting in more peace of mind, and thereby promoting the
general welfare.
   (b)   Protection of Borough Officers and Employees. Whenever any action,
claim or lawsuit is brought against any employee or elected or appointed
officer (herein called "defendant") because of his or her employment by, work
for or association with the Borough of Swarthmore, in which the commission of
errors, omissions or other dereliction is charged, the defendant shall
immediately report the matter to Swarthmore Borough Council, and the Borough
Solicitor, with the consent of the defendant, shall take over the defense of
such action as though it had been brought solely against the Borough. The
Borough shall be considered the real part in interest in any such suit, and
shall indemnify the defendant against loss or damage resulting therefrom,
regardless of the form of action or the parties thereto. Where liability
insurance is available, the Solicitor shall cooperate with counsel for the
insurance company.
   (c)   Limitations. The protection afforded officers and employees by
subsection (b) hereof is subject to the provisions of any applicable statute
and the rulings of any Court having jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall affect
the liability of any insurance company under any policy now in force, or
hereafter issued to the Borough.
(Ord. 782. Passed 7-11-77.)
280.02  OVERTIME.
   The hours of work fixed by the Borough Manager with the approval of the
Council shall not exceed those authorized by the applicable law to escape
liability for overtime. Where, of necessity, overtime must be incurred, the
additional compensation shall be in accordance with law.

spouse, or upon the death of the surviving spouse, then the surviving child or
children under eighteen years of age, and any child under or attaining the age

282.15  EMPLOYMENT NOT GUARANTEED FOR MEMBERS OF PLAN; LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
   (a)   The establishment of the Police Pension Fund shall not be construed as
conferring any legal rights upon any police employee or other person to a
continuation of employment, nor shall it interfere with the rights of the
Borough to discharge any police employee or to treat him or her without regard
to the effect which such treatment might have upon him or her as a member of
the Fund.
   (b)   Any participant who has been granted a leave of absence by Borough
Council may retain a continuous membership in the Fund (for purpose of pension
eligibility date), provided that while on leave of absence he or she regularly
makes a contribution to the Fund in the amount that would be deducted from his
or her pay if he or she were on active duty. This provision likewise applies
where any member is prevented by injury or illness from performing his or her
regular duties as long as he/she is still a full-time police officer and a
member of the Fund.
(Ord. 825. Passed 10-9-84.)
282.16  NON-ALIENATION OF BENEFITS; PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS.
   Except insofar as may otherwise be required by law, no benefit under the
Police Pension Fund shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation,
sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt so
to do shall be void, except as specifically provided in the Fund; nor shall any
such benefits be in any manner liable for or subject to garnishment,
attachment, execution, levy or other legal process for the collection of debts,
contract, liabilities, engagements or torts of the person entitled to such
benefit.
(Ord. 825. Passed 10-9-84.)
282.17  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE FUND TRUST.
   (a)   The Borough Council desires to continue the Police Pension Fund
permanently, but must necessarily reserve the right to change, modify or
discontinue it. Any change in the Fund will not affect the values that have
been accumulated for each participant prior to the date of the change. If the
Fund is ever terminated, the participants who have retired under its provisions
will be entitled to first claim of the assets of the Trust Fund, and any
balance of the assets will be distributed among all other participant's
according to a formula to be developed by the Police Pension Committee and
approved by the Borough Council.
   (b)   No person participating in the Fund established pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter who becomes entitled to receive a benefit therefrom

upon which he or she first became entitled thereto.
(Ord. 825. Passed 10-9-84.)
282.18  FUND DOCUMENTATION.
   Notwithstanding any information that is made available by the Borough of
Swarthmore, the Retirement Committee, or the Trustee to members of the Police
Pension Fund through the distribution of descriptive booklets, bulletin boards
notices, payroll notices or oral announcements, any member may examine the
Fund, the Police Pension Plan, the Trust Agreement, and all amendments thereto,

restrictions or mandates are eliminated and discretion is vested in the
Borough.
(Ord. 825. Passed 10-9-84.)
282.21  SAVING CLAUSE.
   The passage of this chapter and the repeal of any prior ordinances relating
to the establishment and regulation of a Police Employees' Pension Fund or a
Police Pension Fund of the Borough of Swarthmore shall not invalidate the
Police Pension Fund Committee of the Borough created under such ordinances, nor
shall it invalidate any actions of said Committee taken under such ordinances.
This chapter, in such respect, shall be deemed a continuation and codification
of such prior ordinances.
(Ord. 825. Passed 10-9-84.)
282.22  CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE.

(Ord. 1003.  Passed 6-12-06.)
282.23   DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN.
   (a)   Establishment of DROP.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Chapter 282 to the contrary, the Borough hereby establishes a deferred

optional form of benefit under the Plan and being operated by the Borough of
Swarthmore.
      (3)   “Drop notice.”  The form prescribed by the Borough and Association

intent to participate in the DROP.
      (4)   “Drop participation period.”  The period of time from the
commencement of the member's participation in the DROP as stated in the DROP
notice until the member's separation from employment as a Police Officer in
Swarthmore Borough, which shall in no event exceed thirty-six months.
      (5)   “Individual drop participation account.”  A separate trust account
created for the exclusive purpose of accepting monthly pension checks of DROP
participants while they are participating in the DROP.
      (6)   “Member or officer.”  A duly sworn police officer employed by the
Borough and a member of the Police Pension Plan.
      (7)   “Normal retirement date.”  The earliest date at which the officer
meets both the age and service requirements for retirement.
      (8)   “Plan.”  The Swarthmore Borough Police Pension Plan, as the same
may be amended from time to time.
      (9)   “Termination date.”  The date specified in the participant's
irrevocable DROP notice approved by the Borough on which the member or
participant's employment with the Swarthmore Police Department shall terminate.
   (c)   Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) Terms and Conditions.
      (1)   Eligibility.  Any member who has reached his or her normal
retirement date, as defined in this section, may elect to become a participant
in the DROP.  Once a police officer commences participation in the DROP, he or
she may not choose to end participation in the DROP and resume participation in
the Plan.
      (2)   Election to participate.  A member electing to participate in the
DROP must complete and execute a DROP notice.  Election to participate in the
DROP is irrevocable.  The DROP notice must be signed by the member and
notarized and submitted to the Borough at least forty-five days prior to the
date on which the members wishes his or her DROP participation to commence,
which shall be specified in the DROP notice as the effective date of
retirement.  The DROP notice must also include a termination date.  Such
termination date shall be no later than five years after the member's normal
retirement date, as defined in this section, regardless of the date the
participant entered the DROP.
      (3)   Duration.  The DROP participation period shall be no more than
thirty-six months.  The effective date of the DROP participation shall be the
day after the member's effective date of retirement.  Except in the event of
the death of the DROP participant, the DROP termination date shall be the last
calendar day of the thirty-sixth month unless a shorter participation period is
selected.
      (4)   Early termination.  A DROP participant may choose to participate in
the DROP for a period of less than thirty-six months or may change the DROP
termination date during DROP participation to an earlier date without penalty. 
In all cases, the earlier termination date shall be the last calendar day of a
month.
      (5)   DROP pension payments.  Upon entry into the DROP, a member's
monthly retirement benefit, as calculated under the Plan, shall be frozen and
his or her DROP pension payment shall be calculated as if he or she actually
retired on the date he or she entered the DROP.  After the effective date of
the DROP notice, the officer shall no longer earn or accrue additional years of
service for pension calculation purposes under the Plan. The average monthly
pay of the member for pension calculation purposes shall remain as it existed
on the effective date of commencement of participation in the DROP.  No benefit
increases that may occur after a DROP participant's commencement of
participation in the DROP, including bargained pension enhancements, mandated
pension enhancements through arbitration or pension enhancements mandated by
law, will apply to the DROP participant and shall not increase the DROP
participant's frozen pension under the Plan, as calculated on the effective
date of the DROP participation period. The pension benefit payable to the
members shall increase only as a result of cost-of-living adjustments in effect
under the Plan on the effective date of the member's participation in the DROP
or by applicable cost-of-living adjustments specifically granted to DROP
participants.
      (6)   DROP participant contributions.  DROP participants shall neither be
required nor permitted to make contribution into the Plan during the DROP
participation period.
      (7)   Disability during DROP period.  If an officer in the DROP is unable
to return to full police duties for a period of ninety days after a work-
related or non-work-related disability, the employee may be presumed
permanently disabled and may be honorably discharged from service and receive a
pension in the amount of the regular age and service retirement pension as
calculated when the officer entered the DROP program.  If the discharge is due
to a work-related disability the pension shall be at the amount of the normal
retirement pension calculated when the officer entered the DROP but the pension
shall be classified as a disability pension payable at the normal retirement
pension amount. The officer shall have the right to contest the presumption and
the right to appeal the discharge and be reinstated if the disability is proved
to be temporary.
      (8)   Individual DROP participant account.  Beginning on the effective
date of DROP participation and ending the last day of the month of termination,
all monthly pension payments payable to the DROP participant shall be deposited
into an individual DROP participant account established by the Borough and
managed by a third-party administrator.  Each member shall select the
investments in his or her individual investment account from the options
selected by the third-party administrator.  There is no guaranteed rate of
return on the DROP participant account; in no case shall the rate of interest
be less than zero percent or more than four and one-half percent annually.  All
investment and administrative costs shall be charged against the participant's
DROP account.  The participant shall bear the full responsibility for obtaining
appropriate investment advice, as well as for the consequences of any
investment of all or part of the contents of the DROP account.  The DROP
account established for each participant will be considered a tax-deferred
account maintained as part of the plan, and, as a result, will be subject to
the restrictions established under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
            The Borough shall have no responsibility for the financial impact
and/or consequences of a member's participation in the DROP, including, but not
limited to, the investment of the balance of an officer's DROP account, the
performance of any such investments, or any tax consequences flowing from
participation in the DROP. 
      (9)   DROP Payout upon Termination.  No withdrawals from the DROP account
are permitted until DROP participation has ended.  Within forty-five days of
the DROP termination date, the Borough shall pay to the member in a lump-sum
the amount credited to the member's individual DROP participation account as of
the member's DROP termination date less any required withholding taxes.  The
DROP participant may elect to have such lump-sum payment paid directly into an
eligible retirement plan (tax-sheltered rollover distribution) or in a check
made payable to the DROP participant.  If the DROP participant fails to elect a
method of payment of the lump-sum within sixty days of the DROP termination
date, the lump-sum shall be paid directly to the DROP participant.
      (10)   Death.  Upon the death of a DROP participant, participation in the
DROP shall terminate effective as of the date of the member's death.  The
balance of the member's individual DROP participation account as of the
member's date of death shall be paid the beneficiary who shall choose from one
of the payment methods described under "DROP Payout upon Termination."
      (11)   Provisions of employment while in the DROP.
         A.   All DROP participants shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions of employment, rules and regulations and disciplinary procedures as
other officers and members who are not DROP participants that are contained in
all Borough policies, directives, and orders as well as in the collective
bargaining agreement between the Borough and the police.
         B.   An officer's election to participate in the DROP shall in no way
be construed as a limitation on the Borough's right to suspend or terminate an
officer for just cause or to grant the officer an honorable discharge based
upon a physical or mental inability to perform his or her duties.
         C.   Except as specifically listed in this section, a DROP participant
is eligible for any employee benefits provided to the active employees before
retirement.
         D.   While in the DROP, longevity and shift differential pay shall be
frozen at the amount received during the twelve months prior to entering the
DROP.
         E.   Participants in the DROP will not receive any college tuition
reimbursement.
      (12)   Revocation of DROP participation. A DROP participant who
voluntarily terminates his or her employment for any reason prior to the
termination date stated in his or her DROP notice (which has been accepted by
the Borough) shall automatically revoke his or her DROP participation election
and cease employment with the Borough.  All monies in the individual DROP
participation account shall be returned in a lump sum with the options
presented in this section under "DROP Payout upon Termination." No penalty
shall be imposed for early termination of DROP participation.
      (13)   Re-enrollment in the DROP program.  A DROP participant is
ineligible to re-enroll in the DROP program after they have terminated
employment as prescribed in the approved DROP notice, even if they are re-
employed by the Borough with renewed active membership rights in the Plan.
      (14)   Compliance with a future law. The Borough and the FOP and all
current and future DROP participants (as a condition of participating in the
DROP) recognize that laws may be enacted that impact the provisions of this
DROP. The Borough, the FOP and any current and future DROP participants (as a
condition of participating in the DROP) agree and acknowledge that if any such
law requires that this DROP program be altered, changed, modified or amended in
any way, such changes shall be made as required by such law within the required
time period. The FOP and the Borough shall meet to discuss how to most
efficiently implement those changes, and any agreement reached in those
discussions shall be binding on the Borough, the FOP and any current and future
DROP participants. Such discussions, however, shall not in any way delay the
implementation of any such required change as required by law.

284.01  PURPOSE.
   Effective April 13, 1959, the Employer adopted the Borough of Swarthmore
Employees' Pension Plan and executed a Trust Agreement to provide retirement
benefits for its employees.  The Plan was subsequently amended on several
occasions; and effective as of January 1, 1984, the Employer adopted the
amended and restated Plan, as set forth herein.  The Plan and Trust are
intended to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954.
   The provisions of this Plan shall apply only to an employee who terminates
employment on or after the effective date of the Restated Plan.  The rights and
benefits, if any, of an employee, which accrue before the effective date of the
Restated Plan, shall be determined in accordance with the prior provisions of
the Plan.

beneficiary, until a total of 120 monthly payments in all has been paid to the
member and his or her beneficiary.
   (b)   If a member elects a joint and survivor form of benefit and the
member's spouse dies prior to the annuity starting date, the election of the

calculations of an independent pension consultant retained by the Pension
Committee.
   (c)   The contribution shall be delivered to and held by the Trustee as
provided under the Trust Agreement.  The Trust Fund so held by the Trustee
shall be used to pay benefits and expenses in accordance with the Plan, the
Trust Agreement and any agreements with an insurance company or other financial
institution constituting a part of the Plan and Trust.
   (d)   Any forfeitures occurring as a result of a member's termination of
service or in any other manner shall not be applied to increase the benefits
that any member would otherwise receive under the Plan, and the said

   Effective January 1, 1993, the Borough and each member of the Employees'
Pension Plan shall make contributions to the Plan as follows:
   (a)   Each member shall contribute a portion of his or her compensation, up
to a limit of five percent of such compensation, as Council shall, from time to
time, determine.
   (b)   The Borough shall contribute an amount equal to that contributed by
Plan members.  Any additional remaining amounts necessary for the purpose of
reducing the unfunded liability of such Plan, and for application against the
annual obligation of the Plan for future service as determined by the actuary
for the Plan, shall be funded by the Borough.
   (c)   The compensation of a participant in the Plan is the amount paid as a
fixed salary or wage on the anniversary date of January 1, 1993, and
thereafter, excluding overtime, premiums, bonuses and other nonrecurring
compensation.
   (d)   Interest shall be accumulated and credited to a member's contributions

calendar year, beginning December 31, 1993, and shall be credited to the
member's account.
   (f)   Any member who, for any reason whatsoever, shall be unable to receive
a pension after having contributed to the Plan shall be entitled to a refund of
all such contributions, with such interest as may be credited to the member's
account.  Such refund shall be paid within one month after discontinuance of
the member's employment with the Borough.  If such discontinuance is due to
death, such refund shall be paid to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated
by the member or, in the absence of such designation, to the personal
representative of the deceased member.  Neither the member nor the personal
representative of a deceased member shall have any claim to the accumulated
assets of the Fund except for the refund of contributions and interest earned
thereon.

provided that each adviser with such authority and discretion shall be either a
bank, an insurance company or a registered investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and shall acknowledge in writing that it is a
fiduciary with respect to the Plan.  The Committee shall periodically review
the investment performance and methods of each adviser with such authority and
discretion.  The Committee shall establish investment standards and policies,
incorporating any pertinent requirements and objectives of the Plan, including
any interest rate or other actuarial assumptions, in its minutes and

Pension Committee and each other officer or employee of the Borough to whom any
duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the
Employees' Pension Plan or to the management and control of the assets of the
Plan may be delegated or allocated, against any cost or expense (including

faith.

   This Employees' Pension Plan may be amended or terminated at any time,
retroactively or prospectively, by the Borough Council, subject to ninety days
prior notice in writing to the Trustee and the Pension Committee; provided,
however, that no modification or amendment which affects rights to any benefits
by reason of contributions theretofore made under the Plan shall be made,
except to the extent necessary or appropriate to qualify or continue to qualify
the Plan under the Code or any other law; and provided, further, that no
termination, modification or amendment shall permit any part of the corpus or
income of the Fund to be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the
exclusive benefit of members and their beneficiaries under the Plan.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.36  VESTING OF BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION OF PLAN.
   Upon complete discontinuance of the Borough's contributions or full or
partial termination of the Employees' Pension Plan, all members' rights to
their accrued benefits shall become fully vested and shall not thereafter be
subject to forfeiture, except to the extent that law or regulations may
preclude such vesting in order to prevent discrimination in favor of highly
compensated employees.  However, a member's recourse toward satisfaction of his
or her nonforfeitable benefits shall be limited to the Plan assets.  Upon final
termination of the Plan, the Borough shall direct the Trustee to distribute all
assets remaining in the Trust, after payment of any expenses properly
chargeable to the Trust, in accordance with the manner and priority described
for allocation upon termination in Sections
284.37 through
284.43, but such allocation shall be reduced by the value of any prior payments
under the Plan.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.37  ALLOCATION OF FUNDS AFTER EXPENSES.
   Except as otherwise required by law, the value of the Trust funds remaining
after providing for the expenses of final administration of the Employees'
Pension Plan to the extent sufficient shall be allocated for the purpose of
paying retirement benefits under the Plan in the following order of precedence:
   (a)   First, to benefits attributable to a member's voluntary contributions;
   (b)   Second, to benefits attributable to a member's mandatory
contributions;
   (c)   Third, in the case of benefits payable as an annuity:
      (1)   In the case of the benefit of a member or beneficiary which benefit
was in pay status as of the beginning of the three-year period ending on the
termination of the Plan, to each such benefit, based on the provisions of the
Plan (as in effect during the five-year period ending on such date) under which
such benefit would be the least, provided, however, the lowest benefit in pay
status during a three-year period shall be considered the benefit in pay status
for such period.
      (2)   In the case of a member's or beneficiary's benefit (other than a
benefit described in paragraph (c)(1) hereof), which would have been in pay
status as of the beginning of such three-year period if the member had retired
prior to the beginning of the three year period and if his or her benefits had
commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the Plan) as of the beginning of
such period, to each such benefit based on the provisions of the Plan (as in
effect during the five-year period ending on such date) under which such
benefit would be the least.
   (d)   Fourth, to all other nonforfeitable benefits under the Plan;
   (e)   Fifth, to all other benefits under the Plan.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.38  FUND ALLOCATION PRIORITIES.
   For the purposes of Section
284.37:
   (a)   The amount allocated under any paragraph of Section
284.37 with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any
allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of
Section
284.37.
   (b)   If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph of Section
284.37 are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals
which benefits are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated
pro rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the
termination date of the Employees' Pension Plan) of their respective benefits
described in such paragraph.
   (c)   If the assets available for allocation under Section
284.37(c) are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals
described in such paragraph, the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of
individuals described in such paragraph on the basis of the benefits which
would have been described in such paragraph under the Plan as in effect at the
beginning of the five-year period ending on the date of Plan termination.  If
the assets available for allocation under the preceding sentence are sufficient
to satisfy in full the benefits described in the preceding sentence (without
regard to this sentence), then for the purpose of the preceding sentence,
benefits of individuals described in such sentence shall be determined on the
basis of the Plan as amended by the most recent Plan amendment effective during
such five-year period under which assets available for allocation are
sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of the individual described in the
preceding sentence, and any assets remaining to be allocated under such
preceding sentence, shall be allocated under such preceding sentence on the
basis of the Plan as amended by the next succeeding Plan amendment effective
during such period.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.39  REALLOCATION TO AVOID DISCRIMINATION.
   If the IRS determines that the allocation made pursuant to this chapter
results in discrimination prohibited by the law, then, if required to prevent
the disqualification of the Employees' Pension Plan under the law, the assets
allocated under Section
284.37 shall be reallocated to the extent necessary to avoid such
discrimination.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.40  ALLOCATION OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS.
   Any increase or decrease in the value of the Employees' Pension Plan assets
occurring during the period beginning on the later of the date a Trustee is
appointed under the law or the date on which the Plan is to be terminated shall
be allocated in accordance with the provisions of the law.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.41  DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS.
   The assets of the Employees' Pension Plan allocated as provided in this
chapter shall be distributed in such manner as the Pension Committee shall
determine, including, without limitation, lump sum cash payments, cash
installments, the purchase of immediate or deferred annuities or any
combination thereof.  Any residual assets of a Plan may be distributed to the
Borough if, and only if, all liabilities of the Plan to the members and their
beneficiaries have been satisfied and such distribution does not contravene any
provision of law.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.42  FILING OF TERMINAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS.
   The Trustee shall, as part of winding up the affairs of the Employees'
Pension Plan pursuant to its termination, file such terminal and supplemental
reports with the Secretary of Labor and the IRS as may be required.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.43  ASSETS NOT TO BENEFIT BOROUGH.
   Except as provided by the law and Section
284.41, the assets of the Employees' Pension Plan shall never inure to the
benefit of the Borough and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of
providing benefits to members in the Plan and their beneficiaries and defraying
reasonable expenses of administering the Plan.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.44  INSPECTION OF DOCUMENTS.
   Notwithstanding any information that is made available by the Employer, the
Pension Committee or the Trustee to members of the Employees' Pension Plan
through the distribution of descriptive booklets, bulletin board notices,
payroll notices or oral announcements, any member of the Plan may examine the
Plan, the Trust Agreement and all amendments thereto at the main office of the
Employer at such mutually convenient time as is arranged by the member and a
representative of the Employer, the Committee or the Trustee.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.45  MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF PLAN.
   If the Employees' Pension Plan is merged or consolidated with, or assets or
liabilities are transferred to, any other Plan, each Plan member shall be
entitled to receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation or
transfer (if the merged Plan then terminated), which is equal to or greater
than the benefit he or she would have been entitled to receive immediately
before the merger, consolidation or transfer (if this Plan had been
terminated).
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.46  LIMITATION ON RIGHTS CONFERRED BY PLAN.
   Nothing contained in the Employees' Pension Plan shall give any employee the
right to be retained in the employment of the Employer or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated or associated corporations, or affect the right of
any such Employer to dismiss any employee.  The adoption and maintenance of the
Plan shall not constitute a contract between the Employer and any employee, or
consideration for or an inducement to or condition of the employment of any
employee.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.47  TRUST TO BE SOLE SOURCE OF BENEFITS.
   The Trust shall be the sole source of benefits under the Employees' Pension
Plan and the Employer and the Pension Committee assume no liability or
responsibility for payment of such benefits.  Each member, beneficiary or other
person who shall claim the right to any payment under the Plan shall be
entitled to look only to the Trust for such payment and shall not have any
right, claim or demand therefor against the Employer, the Committee or any
member thereof, or any employee of the Employer.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.48  SEPARABILITY.
   In the event that any provision, section, sentence, clause or part of this
chapter shall be held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect or impair
any remaining provision, section, sentence, clause or part of this chapter, it
being the intent of this Borough that such remainder shall be and shall remain
in full force and effect.
(Ord. 826.  Passed 10-9-84.)
284.49  SAVING CLAUSE.
   The passage of this chapter and the repeal by it of any prior enabling
ordinances relating to the establishment and regulation of an Employees'
Pension Plan of the Borough of Swarthmore, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, shall
not invalidate the Pension Committee of the Borough created under such
ordinances, nor shall it invalidate any actions of said Committee taken under
such ordinances.  This chapter, in such respect, shall be deemed a continuation
and codification of such prior enabling ordinances.

420.01  EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.
   In times of emergency resulting from fire, flood, storm or other causes,
when the public health, safety or welfare may be jeopardized, the Mayor may
proclaim and establish temporary special traffic and parking regulations,
giving such notice thereof as may be feasible or possible under the
circumstances. Such regulations shall take effect immediately and remain in
effect until the next regular or special meeting of Council. Council may then
adopt, modify or abrogate the same.
(Ord. 712. Passed 1-11-71.)
420.02  REMOVAL AND IMPOUNDING.
   The Chief of Police is hereby authorized to order the removal and impounding
of any vehicle that is illegally parked or that has become stalled or disabled
within the Borough limits, provided that no such vehicle shall be removed or
impounded otherwise than according to the following provisions:
   (a)   Approved Storage Garage. The Borough Manager shall, from time to time,
designate garages to serve as pounds for the storage of impounded vehicles and
shall report to Council the towing and storage charges and the terms of the
bonds to be provided by the owners of such garages for indemnifying the owners
of such vehicles against the loss thereof or injury or damage thereto while the
same are in the custody of such garage owners. When approved by Council such
terms shall become effective.
   (b)   Notice. Within twelve hours from the time of removal of any vehicle
under the authority of this section, notice thereof shall be sent by the Chief
of Police to the owner of such vehicle, or his agent, designating the place
from which such vehicle was removed, the reason for such removal and the garage
to which the vehicle was removed.
   (c)   Payment of Charges. Payment by the owner or custodian of such vehicle
of the towing and storage charges, unless made under protest, shall constitute
a waiver of any right to contest the same. However, if such payment is made
under protest, such owner or custodian shall be entitled to a hearing before a
magistrate, justice or court of record having jurisdiction, in which case such
owner or custodian shall be proceeded against as a defendant, shall receive
such notice as is provided in the Vehicle Code of Pennsylvania in other cases
of summary offenses and shall have the same rights as to appeal and waiver of
hearing. Such payment shall not relieve the defendant of liability for any fine
or penalty for violating any applicable ordinance or law.
   (d)   Rights of Owner. No vehicle shall be removed for impounding if the
owner or custodian is then present and expresses a willingness and ability to
remove such vehicle immediately. The Chief of Police shall keep a record of all
vehicles impounded and shall be prepared at all reasonable times to furnish the
owners or their agents information as to the place of storage of vehicles and
the procedure for reclaiming them. 
(Ord. 712. Passed 1-11-71. )
420.03  INTERFERENCE WITH SIGNS.

Code. 
(Ord. 712. Passed 1-11-71. )
420.04  SEPARABILITY.
   The provisions of this Traffic Code are separable. If any of such provisions
is held to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of any of
the remaining provisions. Council hereby declares that this Traffic Code would
have been adopted had such invalid provision not been included. 
(Ord. 712. Passed 1-11-71. )

conviction of the alleged offense and may be accepted in full satisfaction of
the prescribed penalty for such alleged violation. Payment of the prescribed
fine need not be accepted when laws prescribe that a certain number of such

444.04   Annual renewal requirement.
444.05   Parking prohibited by vehicles without mobility impaired parking
placard or disabled license plate.
444.06   Other parking prohibitions not affected.
444.01   POLICY.
   It is the objective of this chapter to accommodate the needs of the Borough
for on-street mobility impaired residential accessible parking spaces when no
off-street parking option is reasonably available.
(Ord. 1038.  Passed 6-14-10.)
444.02   APPLICATION PROCESS.
   (a)   Each resident of the Borough seeking to have a parking space
restricted to use by mobility impaired persons designated at or near his or her
residence shall submit to the Borough Manager an application for such mobility
impaired parking space on forms furnished by the Borough Manager for such
purpose.  The application shall, inter alia, require the applicant to provide a
written justification for the need for an on-street mobility impaired
residential accessible parking space in lieu of using the driveway or other
off-street parking.
   (b)   The application shall be accompanied by proof of a mobility impaired
parking placard for the applicant (including number and color), or disabled
license plate number issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
   (c)   The application shall be accompanied by proof of residency, such as a
deed, lease or copy of a tax or utility bill and/or a copy of a valid driver's
license.
(Ord. 1038.  Passed 6-14-10.)
444.03   REVIEW OF APPLICATION; CRITERIA FOR ISSUANCE OR DENIAL OF A PERMIT.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a completed application for an on-street mobility
impaired residential accessible parking space, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall review such application and conduct a site inspection of the residence of
the applicant and make a determination as to whether a permit for an on-street
mobility impaired residential accessible parking space should be issued. There
shall be a presumption that parking for the mobility impaired be located off-
street whenever feasible and appropriate.  In determining whether the applicant
has reasonable opportunity for off-street parking, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall consider some combination of the following criteria, giving weight to
unique conditions on the property at issue:
      (1)   Is the applicant's existing driveway fourteen feet in width, or
wider? Fourteen feet is the recommended minimum driveway width for persons
confined to a wheelchair.
      (2)   If the applicant's driveway is less than fourteen feet, can the
applicant's driveway be widened to accommodate the need for additional parking
space without significant cost or impact to use of the lot?
      (3)   Is the running-slope of the applicant's driveway in excess of one
inch rise per twelve inches of length (a "1:12 ratio")? A running-slope in
excess of the 1:12 ratio is not recommended for mobility impaired parking.
      (4)   Is the cross-slope of the applicant's driveway in excess of one
inch rise per fifty feet of length (a "1:50 ratio")?  A cross-slope of more
than 1:50 is not recommended for mobility impaired parking.
      (5)   Is the driveway of adequate length to accommodate a parked vehicle
(minimum 20'-0" from face of structure to back of side walk)?
      (6)   Is the slope of the land area in between the driveway and the
residence in excess of the 1:12 ratio?  A slope in excess of the 1:12 ratio is
not recommended for wheelchair use.
      (7)   Will the requested on-street space be located in an area with a
lesser running slope and cross slope than would be available off-street?  On-
street spaces should not be approved in areas where the street slopes are
greater than the slopes on or surrounding the applicant's off-street parking
options.
      (8)   Is the requested on-street space located in proximity to a curb
ramp or driveway approach for access to the sidewalk or walkway?  If not, the
requested space location may need to be revised, or a curb ramp may need to be
installed at the expense of the applicant to comply with ADA requirements.
      (9)   Is there a park strip or landscape area between the curb and
sidewalk? For van accessible loading and unloading, a concrete landing area may
need to be constructed at the applicant's expense adjacent to the proposed
space between curb and sidewalk.
   (b)   If the Code Enforcement Officer determines that a reasonable off-
street parking alternative is not available, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
issue a permit for a parking space reasonably close and convenient to the
applicant's residence, taking into account the configuration and use patterns
of the adjoining streets and sidewalks, the circumstances of the applicant, and
any other relevant factor.  Upon approval by the Code Enforcement Officer, the
Borough Manager shall issue a permit for an on-street mobility impaired
residential accessible space and shall cause the approved parking space to be
delineated in the street with paint in the location approved by the Code
Enforcement Officer and a sign to be installed adjacent to such parking space
indicating that parking is restricted to vehicles bearing a mobility impaired
placard or license plate.  To the extent that a concrete landing area or curb
cut is required pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) or (8) above, a permit may be
conditioned upon the applicant installing such landing area or curb cut at the
applicant's expense and in compliance with all applicable building or
accessibility codes.
   (c)   If the applicant's original application is denied, there must be
substantial change in the facts and/or medical condition of the applicant
before requesting a re-evaluation of the decision. 
   (d)   A denied application may be appealed to the Borough's Uniform
Construction Code (UCC) Board of Appeals (see Chapter 1431 of the Codified
Ordinances of the Borough of Swarthmore).
(Ord. 1038.  Passed 6-14-10.)
444.04   ANNUAL RENEWAL REQUIREMENT.
   (a)   All approved on-street mobility impaired residential parking space
permits expire on June 30th in each year.
   (b)   For an on-street mobility impaired residential accessible space to
remain, the applicant will be required to fill out and submit an annual re-
application form to the Borough Manager.
   (c)   Upon expiration of a permit for an on-street mobility impaired
residential parking space, the Borough shall cause the street markings and
signage therefor to be removed.
(Ord. 1038.  Passed 6-14-10.)
444.05   PARKING PROHIBITED BY VEHICLES WITHOUT MOBILITY IMPAIRED PARKING
PLACARD OR DISABLED LICENSE PLATE.
   An on-street mobility impaired residential accessible parking space is
available for use by anyone possessing a valid mobility impaired parking
placard or disabled license plate issued by the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, and is not a reserved parking space for the applicant.  No
person shall park a vehicle which does not display such a placard or license
plate in a designated mobility impaired on-street parking space.
(Ord. 1038.  Passed 6-14-10.)
444.06   OTHER PARKING PROHIBITIONS NOT AFFECTED.
   Nothing herein is intended to allow on-street mobility-impaired parking in
an area where on-street parking is not otherwise permitted.  For example, if
parking is prohibited on one side of a street, this chapter shall not be
construed to allow the designation of an on-street mobility impaired
residential parking space on the side of such street on which parking is
prohibited.

public property and roadways from the spread of running bamboo grasses and the
potential damage caused thereby.
(Ord. 1069.  Passed 6-8-15.)

   As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

   (c)   “Borough.”  The Borough of Swarthmore, Delaware County, Pennsylvania.
   (d)   “Buffer zone.”  A distance of at least ten feet from the edge of any

directing them to abate the condition of bamboo in accordance with this
chapter.  Such notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt
requested, addressed to the owner(s) listed on the current tax address on file
with the Borough.
   (f)   “Receipt of notice.”  Receipt of the notice required herein shall be
the date of mailing said notice.
(Ord. 1069.  Passed 6-8-15.)
676.03  REGULATION OF NEW AND EXISTING BAMBOO.
   (a)   After the effective date of this chapter, the planting of bamboo on
any lot or parcel of land within the Borough limits is prohibited.  Any bamboo
that is already in existence on any property within the Borough limits as of
the effective date of this chapter, may remain on such property, unless the
Borough code enforcement official determines, upon complaint from any abutting
or nearby affected property owner, that any portion of such bamboo has been
allowed to grow upon, extend roots across, or extend branches, stalks or leaves
over any buffer zone.  In the event that the code enforcement official
determines that the area of bamboo within the buffer zone of any bamboo owner's
property is less than 750 square feet, the bamboo owner must remove the bamboo
from the buffer zone within 120 days of receipt of notice, or within 120 days
of the following April 1st if receipt of notice occurs between November 1st and
March 31st, and the bamboo owner must take additional measures by the
anniversary of such 120th day to prevent the regrowth of bamboo within the
buffer zone.  In the event that the code enforcement official determines that
the area of bamboo within the buffer zone of any bamboo owner's property
exceeds 750 square feet, the bamboo owner must remove at least 750 square feet
of bamboo from the buffer zone within 120 days of receipt of notice, or within
120 days of the following April 1st if receipt of notice occurs between
November 1st and March 31st, and must take additional measures by each
subsequent anniversary of such 120th day to prevent the regrowth of bamboo
within that area and to further reduce the square footage of bamboo within the
buffer zone by at least an additional 750 square feet, until all bamboo has
been removed from the buffer zone.
   (b)   This chapter shall not be deemed to alter any rights at common law or
otherwise that any property owner may have to seek remedies and recover the
cost of removal of bamboo on their own property from another person or entity
that has caused the spread of bamboo.  This chapter shall also not be deemed to
create any affirmative duty on behalf of the Borough to require the removal of
bamboo or the enforcement of this chapter, which enforcement shall at all times
remain at the discretion of the Borough.  The code enforcement official shall
further retain discretion in the enforcement of subsection (a) above, such as
in circumstances where the enforcement of the buffer zone is not warranted due
to bamboo height, topography, property size or irregularity, or reduced risk of
harm to neighboring properties.
(Ord. 1069.  Passed 6-8-15.)
676.99  ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Any bamboo owner who fails to comply with the terms of Section
676.03 shall be in violation of the terms of this chapter.

unabated, the Borough may, at its own discretion, cause the condition to be
removed or abated, with the cost of such removal or abatement, plus any fines,
legal fees and collection costs, to be charged and collected by a civil action
or by the filing of a lien against the property.

824.01  SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Swarthmore Cable
Communications Regulatory Code."
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.02  PURPOSE.
   The Borough of Swarthmore finds that the development of cable systems has
the potential of having a great benefit to and positive impact on the people of
Swarthmore. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technologies associated
with cable television, the Borough also finds that public convenience, safety,
and general welfare can best be served by vesting in the Borough, or such
persons as the Borough designates, the power to regulate the construction and
operation of cable systems. Further, the Borough recognizes that cable systems
have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to
Borough residents but also a variety of broadband, interactive services to
Borough agencies and other institutions. For these purposes, the following
goals, among others, underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter:
   (a)   Cable services should be available to as many Borough residents as
possible.
   (b)   Each cable system should be capable of accommodating both the present
and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of the community.
   (c)   Each cable system should be constructed and maintained during the
franchise term so that new components may be integrated to the maximum extent
possible into existing system facilities.
   (d)   Each cable system should be responsive to the needs and interests of
the local community.
   The Borough intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be
construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes, and
that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter be construed to include the
foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof.

permit its use for such purposes, and a franchisee shall be deemed to gain only
those rights to use as are properly in the Borough and as the Borough may have
the undisputed right and power to give.

whatever manner exercised. Unless otherwise specified in a franchise agreement,
the addition, deletion, or other change of any general partner of the

824.04  GRANT OF FRANCHISE
   (a)   Grant of Franchise.  The Borough may grant one or more cable
television franchises and each such franchise shall be awarded in accordance
with and subject to the Provisions of this chapter. This chapter may be amended
from time to time, and in no event shall this chapter be considered a contract
between the Borough and a franchisee such that the Borough would be prohibited
from amending any provision hereof.
   (b)   Franchise required.  No person may construct or operate a cable system
over, on, or under a public right of way in the Borough without a franchise
granted by the Borough unless otherwise authorized by law, and no person may be
granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement with the
Borough pursuant to this chapter.
   (c)   Franchise Characteristics.
      (1)   A franchise authorizes use of streets within the Borough for
installing cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, and other
facilities to operate a cable system, but does not expressly or implicitly
authorize the franchisee to provide service to, or install cables, wires,
lines, underground conduit, or any other equipment or facilities on private
property without owner consent (except for use of compatible easements pursuant
to Section 621 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 541(a)(2)), or to use publicly or
privately-owned conduits without a separate agreement with the owners.
      (2)   The term of a franchise shall not exceed 15 years and may not
exceed five years unless the franchise agreement contains clear and enforceable
provisions for regulating upgrades, improving customer service requirements,
reevaluating access requirements, and making such other requirements as may be
necessary in light of advancements in technology.
      (3)   A franchise is nonexclusive and revocable and will not explicitly
or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable
systems within the Borough, or affect the Borough's right to authorize use of
Borough streets by other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes
as it determines appropriate.
      (4)   Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by the
Borough and a franchisee, such franchise agreement shall constitute a contract
between the franchisee and the Borough, and the terms, conditions, and
provisions of such franchise agreement, subject to this chapter and all other
duly enacted and applicable laws, shall define the rights and obligations of
the franchisee and the Borough relating to the franchise.
      (5)   All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to
any prior lawful occupancy of the streets, and the Borough reserves the right
to reasonably designate where a franchisee's facilities are to be placed within
the streets.
      (6)   A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and
personal to the original franchisee. Except as otherwise agreed to in a
franchise agreement no transfer of a franchise shall occur without the prior
consent of the Borough pursuant to this chapter and the franchise agreement,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   (d)   Franchisee Subject to Other Laws, Police Power:
      (1)   A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with
all applicable federal, state, and Borough laws. A franchisee shall at all
times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power of the Borough, 
including all rights the Borough may have under 47 USC 552.
      (2)   No course of dealing between a franchisee and the Borough, nor any
delay on the part of the Borough or franchisee in exercising any rights
hereunder, shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the Borough  or
franchisee or acquiescence in the actions of the Borough or franchisee in
contravention of rights, except to the extent expressly waived by the Borough
or franchisee or expressly provided for in a franchise agreement.
      (3)   The Borough shall have such authority to regulate cable systems,
franchisees, and franchises as may now or hereafter be lawfully permissible;
and all rights granted to the Borough by the Cable Act and the FCC are hereby
reserved, whether expressly enumerated or not.
   (e)   Interpretation of Franchise Terms.
      (1)   The express terms of this chapter will prevail over conflicting or
inconsistent provisions in a franchise agreement.
      (2)   The provisions of a franchise agreement will be liberally construed
in favor of the Borough.
      (3)   Except as to matters that are governed by federal law or
regulation, a franchise agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Pennsylvania.
   (f)   Right of Condemnation Reserved.  Nothing in this chapter or the
franchise shall limit any right the Borough may have to acquire by eminent
domain or otherwise any property of franchisee.

at minimum, the following information:
         A.   Name and address of the applicant and identification of the
ownership and control of the applicant, including: the names and addresses of
the ten largest holders of an ownership interest in the applicant and
affiliates of the applicant, and all persons with 5% or more ownership interest

         C.   A demonstration of the applicant's legal qualifications to
construct and/or operate the proposed cable system, including but not limited
to a demonstration that the applicant meets the following criteria:
            1.   The applicant must not have submitted an application for an
initial or renewal franchise to the Borough, which was denied on the grounds
that the application failed to serve the public interest, or as to which any
challenges to such franchising decision were finally resolved adversely to the

               withholds information that the applicant lawfully is required to
provide.
            7.   An applicant shall not be issued a franchise if an elected
official of the Borough holds a controlling interest in the applicant or an
affiliate of the applicant.
               Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borough shall provide an
opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a
franchise under divisions (b)(2), (3) or (5) of this section by virtue of the
particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the
applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom, the lack of involvement of the
applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of
cable television systems.
         D.   A statement prepared by a duly authorized financial officer
regarding the applicant's financial ability to complete the construction and
operation of the cable system proposed.

community needs assessment conducted by or for the Borough, and how the
proposal will provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access
channel capacity, facilities, or financial support to meet the community's
needs and interests.
         K.   Pro forma financial projections for the proposed franchise term,
including a statement of projected income, and a schedule of planned capital
additions, with all significant assumptions explained in notes or supporting
schedules.
         L.   If an applicant proposes to provide cable service to an area
already served by an existing franchisee, the identification of the area where
the overbuild would occur, the potential subscriber density in the area that
would encompass the overbuild, and the ability of the streets to accommodate an
additional system.
         M.   Any other information as may be reasonably necessary to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this chapter or that bears on

      (3)   The Borough shall review each application for a franchise to
determine whether the public interest would be served by granting the same, and
shall consider in particular:
         A.   The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with
the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise for
the Borough.
         B.   Whether the quality of the applicant's service under an existing
franchise in Swarthmore, including signal quality, response to customer

         C.   Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal
qualifications to provide cable service.
         D.   Whether the applicant's proposal is reasonable to meet the future
cable- related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the
cost of meeting such needs and interests.
         E.   Whether, to the extent not considered as part of division (b)
(3)D., the applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial support.
         F.   Whether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and
private property which would be used by the cable system, including the extent
to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of
property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the
public rights-of-way; the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of
cable to meet the cable-related needs and interests of the community; and, to
the extent permissible pursuant to the provisions of the cable act, the
comparative superiority or inferiority of competing proposals.
         G.   Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or
controls any other cable system in the Borough, or whether grant of the
application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable
service in the Borough.

      (4)   If the Borough finds that it is in the public interest to issue a
franchise considering the factors set forth above, it shall issue a franchise,
subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise agreement. If
the Borough denies a franchise, it will issue a written decision explaining why
the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding whether to issue or not to issue a
franchise, the Borough may hold one or more public hearings or implement other
procedures under which comments from the public on an applicant's proposal may
be received. The Borough also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based
on its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject any
application which is incomplete. This chapter is not intended and shall not be
interpreted to grant any applicant or existing franchisee standing to challenge
the issuance of a franchise to another.
      (5)   If the Borough grants a franchise subject to the applicant's entry
into a franchise agreement, the Borough and the franchisee shall agree on the
terms of a franchise agreement within 30 calendar days from the date of the
Borough resolution granting the franchise. This period may be extended for good
cause by the Borough. If agreement is not reached with the Borough within 30
calendar days from the date of the Borough resolution granting the franchise,
or if the period is not extended by the Borough, the franchise will be null and
void without further action by the Borough. The Borough shall approve or
disapprove  the proposed agreement by resolution, or may direct that it be
subject to further negotiation.
   (c)   Renewal Proceedings.  The Borough shall conduct renewal proceedings in
accordance with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546, as amended. If
Section 626 of the Cable Act is repealed or for any other reason is
inapplicable to a renewal proceeding, such proceeding shall be conducted as a
proceeding on a request for initial franchise in accordance with division (b)
of this section.
   (d)   Application for Modification of a Franchise.  An application for
modification of a franchise agreement shall include, at minimum, the following
information:
      (1)   The specific modification requested;

disapproved, demonstrated through inter alia submission of financial pro forma;
      (3)   A statement whether the modification is sought pursuant to Section
625 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 545, and if so, a demonstration that the requested
modification meets the standards set forth in 47 USC 545;
      (4)   Any other information that the applicant believes is necessary for
the Borough to make an informed determination on the application for
modification; and
      (5)   An affidavit or declaration or the applicant or authorized officer
certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and
certifying that the application is consistent with all federal and state law
requirements.

after the effective date of this chapter shall be accompanied by a filing fee
in the following amount, as appropriate:
      (1)   For an initial franchise:         $5,000.00
      (2)   For renewal of a franchise:         As specified in the franchise
agreement

signals.
      (3)   At the times specified in the franchise agreement or as required by
FCC rules, the franchisee shall perform at its expense proof of performance
tests, and such other tests as may be specified in the franchise agreement,

and FCC requirements. The franchisee shall provide the proof of performance
test results promptly to the Borough. The Borough may require in each franchise
agreement that the franchisee shall provide the Borough ten days advance
written notice when a proof of performance or other required test is scheduled
so that the Borough may have an observer present. The Borough shall have the
right to inspect the cable system facilities during and after their

      (6)   Any and all streets, public property, or private property which are
disturbed or damaged during the construction, repair, replacement, relocation,
operation, maintenance, or construction of the system shall be promptly
repaired by the franchisee at its expense.
      (7)   A franchisee shall, at its expense, and by a time specified by the
Borough, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of
its property when required by the Borough by reason of traffic conditions,
public safety, street construction, street resurfacing or widening, change of
street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal
lines, tracks, or any other type of municipal, public utility improvements,
street vacation, or for any other purpose where the convenience of the Borough
would be served thereby; provided, however, that the franchisee shall, in all
such cases, have the privilege of abandoning any property in place. The Borough
shall reimburse a franchisee under this subsection to the same extent that it
reimburses telephone, electric and other like companies for such disconnection,
relocation or removal.
      (8)   If any removal, relaying, or relocation is required to accommodate
the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of another person that
is authorized to use the public streets, a franchisee shall, after 30 days'
advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested
by the responsible entity. The Borough may resolve disputes as to
responsibility for costs associated with the removal, relaying, or relocation
of facilities as among entities authorized to install facilities in the public
streets if the parties are unable to do so themselves.
      (9)   In the event of an emergency, or where a cable system creates or is
contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the Borough
may remove, relay, or relocate that cable system without prior notice. When
possible, the Borough will make reasonable efforts to notify the franchisee and
give the franchisee reasonable opportunity to cure.
      (10)   A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a
building moving permit issued by the Borough, temporarily raise or lower its
wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal
or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting same,
and the franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance,
except in the case where the requesting person is the Borough, in which case no
such payment shall be required. The franchisee shall be given not less than
five calendar days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
      (11)   A franchisee shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang
a street of the Borough so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming
in contact with the wires and cables of the franchisee. Such trimming must be
done under the supervision and direction of the Borough, but at the expense of
the franchisee.
      (12)   A franchisee must use existing underground conduits or overhead
utility facilities whenever feasible and may not erect poles or place equipment
in public rights-of-way without notification to the Borough at least 48 hours
prior to the installation. Copies of agreements for use of conduits or other
facilities shall be filed with the Borough.
      (13)   On streets where electrical and Telephone utility wiring is
located underground, either at the time of initial construction of a cable
system or at any time thereafter, a franchisee's cable shall also be located
underground at the franchisee's expense. Between a street and a subscriber's
residence, a franchisee's cable must be located underground if both electrical
and telephone utility wiring are located underground.  If either electric or
telephone utility wiring is aerial, a franchisee may install aerial cable,
except where a property owner or resident requests underground installation and
agrees to bear the additional cost of such installation over and above the cost
of aerial installation. In the event the telephone or electric utilities are
reimbursed by the Borough for the placement of cable underground or the
movement of cable, the franchisee shall be reimbursed on the same terms and
conditions as the telephone or electric utilities.
      (14)   All wires, cable lines, and other transmission lines, equipment,
and structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference
with the rights and convenience of property owners. The Borough may  issue such
rules and regulations concerning the installation and maintenance of a cable
system installed in, on, or over the streets, as may be consistent with this
chapter and the franchise agreement. The Borough shall have the right to
install and maintain free of charge upon the poles owned by the franchisee any
wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system
operations of the franchisee.
      (15)   All safety practices required by law shall be used during
construction, maintenance, and repair of a cable system.  A franchisee shall
not place facilities, equipment, or fixtures where they will interfere with any
gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer, or other utility facilities, or
obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents of
the Borough of their use of any street or any other public right-of-way.
      (16)   Prior to erection of any towers, poles, or conduits or the
construction, upgrade, or rebuild of a system authorized under this chapter,
the franchisee shall first submit to the Borough and other designated parties
in accordance with applicable municipal ordinances, for approval a concise
description of the facilities proposed to be erected or installed, including
engineering drawings, if required, together with a map and plans indicating the
proposed location of all such facilities. No erection or installation of any
tower, pole, underground conduit or fixture, or any with a map and plans
indicating the proposed location of all such facilities. No erection or
installation of any tower, pole, underground conduit, or fixture or any
rebuilds or upgrading of the cable communications system shall be commenced by
any person until such approval therefor has been received from the Borough.
      (17)   Any contractor proposed for work or construction, installation,
operation, maintenance, or repair of system equipment shall meet the
performance standards and be insured and bonded in accordance with the
standards of the franchisee.
      (18)   In the event the use of any part of a cable system is discontinued
for any Reason for a continuous period of 12 months, or in the event such
system or property has been installed in any street without complying with the
requirements of this chapter or a franchise agreement, or the franchise has
been terminated or canceled or has expired, the franchisee, within 30 days
after written notice by the Borough, shall commence removal from the streets of
all such property as the Borough may require.
      (19)   The Borough may extend the time for the removal of abandoned
facilities for a period not to exceed 180 days.
      (20)   In the event of such removal or abandonment, the franchisee shall
restore the area to a condition satisfactory to the Borough.
   (c)   Publicizing Proposed Construction Work.  A Franchisee shall publicize
significant proposed construction work at least one week prior to commencement
of that work by causing written notice of such construction work to be
delivered to the Borough Manager and by notifying those persons most likely to
be affected by the work in at least two of the following ways: by telephone, in
person, by mail, by distribution of flyers to residences, by publication in
local newspapers, or in any other manner reasonably calculated to provide
adequate notice. In addition, before entering onto any person's property, the
franchisee shall make reasonable efforts to contact the property owner or (in
the case of residential property) the resident at least two days in advance. If
the franchisee must enter premises, it must make reasonable efforts to schedule
an appointment at the convenience of the owner or resident.

      (3)   All evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and announced

(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.10  CONSUMER PROTECTION; CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUIREMENTS.
   Every franchise agreement shall require a franchisee to comply with all
applicable federal, state, and local customer service requirements.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.11  RATE REGULATION.
   (a)   Rate Charge and Rate Schedule.
      (1)   Each franchisee shall in accordance with the provisions of the
Cable Act and the applicable FCC regulations provide information as to its
monthly rates, installation and all other charges, including but not limited to
equipment fees, late fees, and other administrative charges, if any.
      (2)   A franchisee shall give subscribers at least 30 days' notice of its
intention to change monthly rates, equipment charges, and installation charges
by mailing notices thereof to each of the current subscribers to whom such
charges will apply. The franchisee shall give the Borough Manager or his or her
designee 30 days' advance notice of any rate change.
      (3)   The franchisee shall not, as to rates, charges, services, or
facilities make or grant any undue privilege or advantage to any party, nor
subject any party to undue prejudice or disadvantage, provided that the
franchisee may establish reasonable classifications of customers. In accordance
with Section 623(e) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 543(e), nothing in this chapter
prohibits the reduction or waiver of charges in connection with temporary
promotional campaigns or providing a senior citizen discount, provided the same
waivers are provided to all similarly situated customers. Moreover, nothing
shall prohibit the franchisee from entering into service arrangements (with
discounts and special terms) with large residential communities or dwellings
(including apartments, condominiums and other dwelling units), hotels/motels
and mobile home parks located within the Borough.
   (b)   Local Regulatory Framework.  The Borough shall regulate all rates and
charges to the extent it is allowed to do so by law, provided that the Borough
is certified to regulate rates pursuant to the Cable Act. No rate or charge may
be imposed without prior notification to the Borough except such rates and
charges that the Borough is prohibited from regulating. Subject to the
foregoing, any change made without prior notification is an illegal change, and
a franchisee is prohibited from requesting or requiring a subscriber to pay an
illegal rate as a condition of providing services. The Borough may adopt such
regulations, procedures, and standards as it deems necessary to implement rate
regulation and may regulate rates by amendment to this chapter, by a separate
resolution or ordinance, by amendment to a franchise agreement, or in any other
lawful manner, provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall
conflict with the provisions of section 623 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 543 and
rules promulgated by the FCC thereunder.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.12  FRANCHISE FEE.
   (a)   Findings.  The Borough finds that the streets and public rights-of-way
of the county, state, and Borough to be used by a franchisee for the operation
of a cable television system are valuable public property acquired and
maintained by the county, state, and Borough at great expense to the
taxpayers.  The Borough further finds that the grant of a franchise to use the
public streets and rights-of-way is a valuable property right, without which
the franchisee would be required to invest substantial capital.
   (b)   Payment to Borough.
      (1)   The Borough shall be paid a franchise fee in an amount no less than
5% of a franchisee's gross annual revenues. In the event the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law is greater than 5%, then the Borough reserves
the right to reopen negotiations with the franchisee to address the greater
amount, and any increase in the franchise fee to the maximum allowed by law.
      (2)   To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the franchise
fee is in addition to all other taxes and payments that the franchisee may be
required to pay under any federal, state, or local law and to any other tax,
fee, or assessment imposed by utilities and cable operators for use of their
services, facilities or equipment.
      (3)   To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, payment of the
franchise fee shall not be considered in the nature of a tax.
      (4)   No acceptance of any payment by the Borough shall be construed as a
release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the Borough may have for
further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for
the performance of any other obligation of the franchisee.
      (5)   In the event any franchise fee payment or recomputation amount is
not made on or before the date specified herein, the franchisee shall pay
additional compensation and interest charges computed from such due date, at an
annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the Borough's
primary depository bank during the period such unpaid amount is owed.
      (6)   The franchise fee and any other costs assessed by the Borough
against a franchisee shall be paid quarterly to the Borough and shall commence
as of the effective date of the franchise. The Borough shall be furnished at
the time of each payment with a statement certified by the franchisee's chief
financial officer or an independent certified public accountant reflecting the
total amount of quarterly gross revenues for the payment period. Quarterly
payments shall be made to the Borough no later than 45 days following the end
of each calendar quarter. Quarter computation dates are the last days of the
months of March, June, September, and December. The Borough may require in a
franchise agreement that an annual statement of gross revenues shall be
furnished to the Borough by an independent certified public accountant, and
that the franchisee shall provide an annual complete audit statement for each
calendar year within 90 days from the end of that calendar year.
      (7)   The Borough shall have the right to inspect and copy the
franchisee's records as is necessary to verify the accuracy of the franchisee's
franchise fee payments and other possible levied taxes, and the rights to audit
and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter for a
period of four years from the date of payment. Audits shall be at the expense
of the Borough unless the audit discloses an underpayment of greater that 5% of
the entire amount determined to be payable for the period being audited, in
which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by the franchisee as a cost
incidental to the enforcement of the franchise. Any additional amounts due to
the Borough as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following
written notice to the franchisee by the Borough of the underpayment, which
notice shall include a copy of the audit report, unless written notice of
disagreement is filed by the franchisee with the Borough within such time
period. In the case of a dispute, the issue shall be resolved through binding
arbitration in accordance with the procedures of the American Arbitration
Association.
      (8)   The Borough may require in a franchise agreement that the
franchisee shall maintain its fiscal and financial records in such a manner as
to enable the Board to determine the cost of assets of the franchisee which are
used in providing cable services within the Borough.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.13  INSURANCE; SURETY; INDEMNIFICATION.
   (a)   Indemnification, Insurance and Bonding.  The franchisee shall be
indemnified, insured, and bonded as prescribed in the franchise agreement.
   (b)   Indemnification for Cable Act Claims.  The franchisee shall, at its
sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Borough,
and in its capacity as such, the officers, agents, and employees thereof, from
and against any and all claims, suits, actions, liability, and judgments for
damages or otherwise subject to Section 638 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 558,
arising out of or alleged to arise out of the installation, construction,
operation, or maintenance of its system, including but not limited to any claim
against the franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any
person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright,
trademark, trade name, service mark, or patent, or of any other right of any
person, firm, or corporation. This indemnity does not apply to programming
carried on any channel set aside for public, educational or government use, or
channels leased pursuant to 47 USC 532, unless the franchisee was in any
respect engaged in determining the editorial content of the program, or adopts
a policy of pre-screening programming for the purported purpose of banning
indecent or obscene programming. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Borough from
participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel and obtaining
indemnification for the costs associated therewith.
   (c)   No Limit of Liability.  Neither the provisions of this section nor any
damages recovered by the Borough shall be construed to limit the liability of
the franchisee for damages under any franchise issued hereunder.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.14  SECURITY FUND.
   (a)   Security Deposit.  A franchise agreement may provide that, prior to
the effective date of the franchise, the franchisee shall post with the Borough
a cash security deposit to be used as a security fund to ensure the
franchisee's faithful performance of and compliance with all provisions of this
chapter, the franchise agreement, and other applicable law, and compliance with
all orders, permits, and directions of the Borough, and the payment by the
franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, or taxes due the Borough which arise by
reason of the construction, operation, or maintenance of the system. The amount
of the security fund shall be fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).
   (b)   Surety Bond.  In any franchise agreement entered into before the
effective date of this chapter, the Borough and franchisee may agree that the
franchisee may, in lieu of the security fund, file and maintain with the
Borough a bond with an acceptable surety in the amount of one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00) to indemnify the Borough against any losses it may suffer
in the event the franchisee fails to comply with one or more of the provisions
of its franchise. Said bond shall be obtained at the sole expense of the
franchisee and remain in effect for the full term of the franchise plus an
additional six months thereafter. The franchisee and its surety shall be
jointly and severally liable under the terms of the bond for any damages or
loss suffered by the Borough as a result of the franchisee's nonperformance,
including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of
removal of any property of the franchisee in the event of default, and a
reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, up to the full amount of
the bond. The bond shall provide for 30 days' prior written notice to the
Borough of any intention on the part of the franchisee to cancel, fail to
renew, or otherwise materially alter its terms. Neither the filing of a surety
bond with the Borough, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the Borough
thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the franchisee
or limit the liability of the franchisee under the terms of its franchise for
damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise.
   (c)   Security Fund in Addition to all Other Borough Rights.  The rights
reserved to the Borough with respect to any security fund or an indemnity bond
are in addition to all other rights of the Borough, whether reserved by this
chapter or authorized by other law or the franchise agreement, and no action,
proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund or
indemnity bond will affect any other right the Borough may have.
   (d)   Procedures.  The franchise agreement shall provide for the procedures
to be followed with respect to drawing upon the security fund and surety bond.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.15  PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   Establishment of Performance Bond.  Prior to any cable system
construction, upgrade, or other work in the streets, a franchisee shall
establish in the Borough's favor a performance bond in an amount specified in
the franchise agreement or other authorization as necessary to ensure the
franchisee's faithful performance of the construction, upgrade, or other work.
The amount of such performance bond shall not exceed one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00).
   (b)   Recovery Under Performance Bond.  In the event a franchisee subject to
such a performance bond fails to complete the cable system construction,
upgrade, or other work in the streets in a safe, timely, and competent manner
in accord with the material provisions of the franchise agreement, there shall
be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the
bond, any damages or loss suffered by the Borough as a result including the
full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or
abandonment of any property of the franchisee, or the cost of completing or
repairing the system construction, upgrade, or other work in the streets, plus
a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond.
The Borough may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against
the security fund or surety bond where such amount exceeds that available under
the security fund or surety bond.
   (c)   The Borough shall provide to the franchisee reasonable notice and
opportunity to cure.
   (d)   Changes to Amount of Performance Bond.  The franchise agreement shall
specify that upon completion of the system construction, upgrade, or other work
in the streets and payment of all construction obligations of the cable system
to the satisfaction of the Borough, the Borough shall eliminate the bond or
reduce its amount after a time appropriate to determine whether the work
performed was satisfactory, which time shall be established considering the
nature of the work performed. The Borough may subsequently require a new bond
or an increase in the bond amount for any subsequent construction, upgrade, or
other work in the streets. In any event, the total amount of the bond shall
equal 10% of the cost of the work, but shall not exceed one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00).
   (e)   Qualifications of Sureties.  The performance bond shall be issued by a
surety with an A-1 or better rating of insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide,
Property/Casualty Edition, shall be subject to the approval of the Borough, and
shall contain the following endorsement:
"This bond may not be canceled or allowed to lapse until 60 days after receipt
by the Borough, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of written notice
from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew."
   (f)   Performance Bond in Addition to all Other Borough Rights.  The rights
reserved by the Borough with respect to any performance bond established
pursuant to this chapter are in addition to all other rights and remedies the
Borough may have under this chapter, the franchise agreement, or at law or
equity.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.16  ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Available Remedies.  In addition to any other remedies available at
law or equity, the Borough may apply any one or a combination of the following
remedies in the event a franchisee violates this chapter, its franchise
agreement, or applicable state or federal law:
      (1)   Impose liquidated damages in such amount, whether on a per-diem,
per- incident, or other measure of violation, as provided in the franchise
agreement. Payment of liquidated damages by the franchisee will not relieve the
franchisee of its obligation to comply with the franchise agreement and the
requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Revoke the franchise pursuant to the procedures specified in this
chapter.
      (3)   In addition to or instead of any other remedy, the Borough may seek
legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.
      (4)   Impose penalties available under state and local law for violation
of Borough ordinances.
   (b)   Determination of Appropriate Remedies.  In determining which remedy or
remedies are appropriate, the Borough shall take into consideration the nature
of the violation, The person or persons bearing the impact of the violation,
the nature of the remedy required in order to prevent further violations, and
such other matters as the Borough determines are appropriate to the public
interest.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.17  TRANSFERS.
   (a)   Borough Approval Required.  No transfer shall occur without prior
approval of the Borough.
   (b)   Application.  An application for a transfer shall provide complete
information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal,
financial, technical, and other qualifications of the transferee, and on the
potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service. At a minimum,
the information required in division 824.05(b)(2) of this chapter shall be
provided with respect to the proposed transferee.
   (c)   Determination by Borough.  In making a determination as to whether to
grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions an application for a transfer of a
franchise, (which determination the Borough shall make in accordance with
Section 617 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 537) the Borough shall consider the legal,
financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the
system; whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its
franchise agreement and this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's
commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether the transferee owns or controls
any other cable system in the Borough, or whether operation by the transferee
may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the
Borough; and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer
would adversely affect subscribers, the Borough's interest under this chapter,
the franchise agreement, or other applicable law, or make it less likely that
the future cable-related needs and interests of the community would be
satisfied at a reasonable cost. The Borough reserves the right to review the
purchase price of any transfer or assignment of a cable system. Any negotiated
sale value which the Borough deems unreasonable will not be considered in the
rate base for any subsequent request for rate increases, if permitted by
applicable law.

shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by

will assume the obligations and liabilities known and unknown of the previous
franchisee under this chapter and the franchise agreement.
   (e)   Approval Does Not Constitute Waiver.  Subject to applicable statutes
of limitations, approval by the Borough of a transfer of a franchise does not
constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the Borough under this

(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.18  REVOCATION OR TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (a)   Basis for Revocation.  A franchise may be revoked by the Borough for a
franchisee's failure to construct, operate or maintain the cable system as
required by this chapter or the franchise agreement, for defrauding or
attempting to defraud the Borough or subscribers, if the franchise is declared
bankrupt, or for any other material violation of this chapter or material
breach of the franchise agreement. To invoke the provisions of this section,
the Borough shall give the franchisee written notice via certified mail of the
default in its performance. If within 30 calendar days following such written
notice from the Borough to the franchisee, the franchisee has not taken
corrective action or corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously
pursued to the satisfaction of the Borough, the Borough may give written notice
via certified mail to the franchisee of its intent to revoke the franchise,
stating its reasons; provided that no opportunity to cure shall be provided
where the franchisee has defrauded or attempted to defraud the borough or its
subscribers, or in the event the franchisee is declared bankrupt. In the case
of a fraud or attempted fraud, the franchise may be revoked after the hearing
required under division (b) of this section; revocation for bankruptcy shall be
governed by division (c) of this section.
   (b)   Procedure.  Prior to revoking a franchise, the Borough shall hold a
public hearing, upon 30 calendar days' notice, at which time the franchisee and
the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Following the public
hearing, the Borough may determine whether to revoke the franchise based on the
information presented at the hearing, and other information of record. If the
Borough determines to revoke a franchise, it shall issue a written decision
setting forth the reasons for its decision. A copy of such decision shall be
transmitted to the franchisee.
   (c)   Revocation After Bankruptcy.  Any franchise may, at the option of the
Borough following a public hearing before the Borough, be revoked 120 calendar
days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that 120-day period:
      (1)   Such assignment, receivership, or trusteeship has been vacated; or
      (2)   Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and has
executed an
         agreement, approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, assuming and
agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement, and such other conditions as may be established or as are
required pursuant to Section
824.17.
   (d)   Revocation After Foreclosure.  In the event of foreclosure or other
judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment, or property of a franchisee,
the Borough may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the
Borough, by serving notice on the franchisee and the successful bidder at the
sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the
franchise will be revoked and will terminate 30 calendar days after serving
such notice, unless:
      (1)   The Borough has approved the transfer of the franchise to the
successful bidder; and
      (2)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the Borough to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and
this chapter, and such other conditions as may be established or as are
required pursuant to Section
824.17.
   (e)   Rights on Revocation.  If the Borough revokes a franchise, or if for
any other reason a franchisee abandons, terminates, or fails to operate or
maintain service to its subscribers, the following procedures and rights are
effective:
      (1)   The Borough may require the former franchisee to remove its
facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former
franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the Borough may
have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense.
      (2)   In the event of revocation, the Borough, by resolution, may acquire
ownership of the cable system at an equitable price.
      (3)   If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee or the franchisee
fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers or otherwise terminates
the franchise, the ownership of all portions of the cable system in public
rights-of-way shall revert to the Borough and the Borough may sell, assign, or
transfer all or part of the assets of the system.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.19  RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS PROTECTED.
   (a)   Discriminatory Practices Prohibited.  The franchisee shall not deny
service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers,
programmers, or residents of the Borough on the basis of race, color, religion,
national origin, sex, or age. Notwithstanding the foregoing, franchisee may
offer price discounts to senior citizens. Moreover, nothing shall prohibit a
franchisee from entering into service agreements (with discounts and special
terms) including apartments, condominiums and other dwelling units, hotels/
motels, and mobile home parks located within the Borough. The franchisee shall
comply at all times with all applicable federal, state, and Borough laws, and
all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination.
   (b)   Equal Employment Opportunity.  A franchisee shall not refuse to
employ, discharge from employment, or discriminate against any person in
compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of
race, color, religion, national origin, sex or age. The franchisee shall comply
with federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing equal employment
opportunities, as the same may be from time to time amended.
   (c)   Subscriber Privacy.  A franchisee shall at all times protect the
privacy of all subscribers pursuant to the provisions of Section 631 of the
Cable Act, 47 USC 551. A franchisee shall not condition subscriber service on
the subscriber's grant of permission to disclose information which, pursuant to
federal or state law, cannot be disclosed without the subscriber's explicit
consent.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 7-14-97; Ord. 938.  Passed 7-12-99.)
824.20  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Compliance With Laws. The franchisee and the Borough shall comply with
all applicable federal, state, and Borough laws and regulations as they become
effective, unless otherwise stated.
   (b)   Severability.  If any term, condition, or provision of this chapter
shall, to any extent, be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder
hereof shall be valid in all other respects and continue to be effective. In
the event of a subsequent change in applicable law so that the provision which
had been held invalid is no longer invalid, said provision shall thereupon
return to full force and effect without further action by the Borough and shall
thereafter be binding on the franchisee and the Borough.
   (c)   Emergency Use.  Upon request of the Borough, a franchisee shall, at
its sole expense, make available systems and related facilities to the Borough
for use during any emergency or disaster.
   (d)   Captions.  Captions and headings of this chapter are for convenience
and reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning and
interpretation of any provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   Calculation of Time.  Unless otherwise indicated, when the performance
or doing of any act, duty, matter, payment, or thing is required hereunder and
a period of time or duration for the fulfillment of doing thereof is prescribed
and is fixed herein, the time shall be computed so as to exclude the first and
include the last day of the prescribed or fixed period of time. When the last
day of the period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, that day
shall be omitted from the computation.

structure have been completed in accordance with all applicable regulations and
orders of the municipality and the required proof of such completion received
by the designated officer, and if the municipality has not incurred any costs
for repairs, removal or securing, the fund shall be returned to the named
insured. If the municipality has incurred costs for repairs, removal or
securing of the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the
fund, and if excess funds remain, the municipality shall transfer the remaining
funds to the named insured.

municipality pursuant to this section, and not returned to the named insured,
such interest shall belong to the municipality. To the extent that proceeds are
returned to the named insured, interest earned on such proceeds shall be
distributed to the named insured at the time that the proceeds are returned.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the
municipality to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to prohibit the municipality and the named insured from

   Pursuant to the authority contained in the Local Tax Enabling Act, being the

providing revenue for general Borough purposes is hereby levied, assessed and
imposed upon the transfer of real property or an interest in real property
within the limits of the Borough of Swarthmore, regardless of where the

in this chapter.
(Ord. 851.  Passed 10-11-88.)
884.04  PAYMENT OF TAX.

vellum parchment or paper upon which such document is written or printed, a tax
payable to the Borough of Swarthmore, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, at the
rate of one percent of the value of the real estate represented by such
document.  Such tax shall be payable at the earliest of the time the document
is presented for recording, within thirty days of acceptance of such document
or within thirty days of becoming an acquired company.
(Ord. 851.  Passed 10-11-88.)
884.05  EXEMPT PARTIES.
   The United States or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any of their
instrumentalities, agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter.  The exemption of such governmental
bodies shall not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from
liability for the tax.
(Ord. 851.  Passed 10-11-88.)
884.06  EXCLUDED TRANSACTIONS.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall not be imposed upon:
   (a)   A transfer to the Commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions by gift, dedication or deed in lieu of
condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with condemnation
proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning body of the property condemned
to the owner of record at the time of condemnation, which reconveyance may
include property line adjustments provided said reconveyance is made within one
year from the date of condemnation.
   (b)   A document which the Commonwealth is prohibited from taxing under the
Constitution or statutes of the United States.
   (c)   A conveyance to a municipality, township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, township, school district or
county of tax delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax claim bureau sale.
   (d)   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend or limit
existing record legal title or interest.
   (e)   A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by cotenants;
however, if any of the parties takes shares greater in value than their
undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
   (f)   A transfer between husband and wife, or between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced, provided the property
or interest therein subject to such transfer was acquired by the husband or
wife prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and
child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or spouse of a
brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a brother or sister

by testate or intestate succession from a personal representative of a decedent
to the descendent's devisee or heir.
   (h)   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be exempt if the
transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of the possible
beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are contingent or specifically
named.  No such exemption shall be granted unless the recorder of deeds is
represented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the
grantor and all possible beneficiaries.
   (i)   A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to a
beneficiary of an ordinary trust.

party were his or her principal, no tax would be imposed under this chapter. 
Where the document by which title is acquired by a grantee or the statement of
value fails to set forth that the property was acquired by the grantee from, or
for the benefit of, his or her principal, there is a rebuttable presumption
that the property is the property of the grantee in his or her individual
capacity if the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this paragraph
(k)(2).
   (l)   A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation of a
corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation, except where the
Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is avoidance of the
tax imposed by this chapter.
   (m)   A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held of
record in the name of the corporation or association, where the grantee owns
stock of the corporation or an interest in the association in the same

conveyed and where the stock of the corporation or the interest in the
association has been held by the grantee for more than two years.

to a grantee of property conveyed by the grantee to that agency or authority as
security for a debt of the grantee or a transfer to a nonprofit industrial
development agency or authority.

      (2)   The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the real
estate transferred.
   (p)   A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial sale in
which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a mortgage, unless the
holder assigns the bid to another person.
   (q)   Any transfer between religious organizations or other bodies or
persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate is not
being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial purposes.
   (r)   A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax-exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (68A Stat.
3, 26 U.S.C. Section 501(c)(3)) and which has as its primary purpose
preservation of land for historic, recreational, scenic, agricultural or open-
space opportunities.
   (s)   A transfer of real estate devoted to the business of agriculture to a
family farm corporation by a member of the same family which directly owns at
least seventy-five percent of each class of the stock hereof.

in a real estate company or family farm corporation.

such document is not subject to tax under this chapter.
(Ord. 851.  Passed 10-11-88.)
884.07  DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ASSOCIATIONS, CORPORATIONS AND ACQUIRED
COMPANIES.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided herein, documents which make, confirm or
evidence any transfer or demise of title to real estate between associations or
corporations and the members, partners, shareholders or stockholders thereof
are fully taxable.  For the purposes of this chapter, corporations and
associations are entities separate from their members, partners, stockholders
or shareholders.
   (b)   A real estate company is an acquired company upon a change in the
ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the change:
      (1)   Does not affect the continuity of the company; and
      (2)   Of itself or together with prior changes has the effect of
transferring, directly or indirectly, ninety percent or more of the total
ownership interest in the company within a period of three years.
   (c)   With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation, or when,

of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it fails to meet the
minimum requirements of a family farm corporation under this chapter.
   (d)   Within thirty days after becoming an acquired company, the company
shall present for recording a declaration of acquisition with the Recorder of
Deeds of Delaware County for the purpose of noting thereon or the affixation
thereto of such documentary stamps or other evidence of the payment of this tax

884.08  CREDITS AGAINST THE TRANSFER TAX.
   (a)   Where there is a transfer of a residential property by a licensed real
estate broker, which property was transferred to him or her within the

her shall be given to him or her toward the amount of the tax upon the
transfer.
   (b)   Where there is a transfer by a builder of residential property which
was transferred to the builder within the preceding year as consideration for

the amount of the tax paid at the time of the transfer to the builder shall be
given to the builder toward the amount of tax due upon the transfer.

claim, lien, judgment, estate or cost of the sale and of the writ upon which
the sale is made, and the sheriff or other officer conducting such sale shall
pay the tax herein imposed out of the first moneys paid to him or her in
connection therewith.  If the proceeds of the sale are insufficient to pay the
entire tax herein imposed, the purchaser shall be liable for the remaining tax.
(Ord. 851.  Passed 10-11-88.)
884.10  REAL ESTATE OR INTEREST THEREIN PARTIALLY LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH.
   Where real estate or an interest in real estate lying partly within the

transferred, the tax herein imposed shall be calculated upon such portion of
the real estate or interest therein lying within the boundaries of the Borough,
as determined by the Realty Transfer Tax Statement of Value filed with the
Recorder of Deeds, or if no such filing is required, by affidavit of the
transferor, or as separately stated in the document of transfer; provided,
however, such value shall in no event be less than the highest assessed
valuation for local tax purposes placed upon the real estate or the interest in
the real estate in the assessment of the property within the Borough.
(Ord. 851.  Passed 10-11-88.)
884.11  STATEMENT OF VALUE.
   Every document lodged with or presented to the Recorder of Deeds of Delaware
County for recording shall set forth therein and as a part of such document the
true, full and complete value thereof.  When the full, complete and actual
consideration for the transfer which is subject to the tax is not set forth in
the document, the person liable for the tax shall, contemporaneously with the
filing of the document, file with the Recorder of Deeds a "Realty Transfer Tax
Statement of Value," identical to that promulgated by the Department of Revenue
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or, in the instance of an "acquired
company," a "Realty Transfer Tax Declaration of Acquisition," identical to that

shall act as agent for the Borough in the collection of the transfer tax as
provided in 16 P.S. 11011-6, as amended.  The tax thus collected shall be
payable by the Recorder to the Treasurer of the Borough of Swarthmore at least
monthly or at such other intervals as the Borough and the Recorder of Deeds

(Ord. 851.  Passed 10-11-88.)
884.13  DOCUMENTARY STAMPS OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT.

   In the event a determination or redetermination of transfer tax due is made
by the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue pursuant to Section 1111-C of Act
1986-77, 72 P.S. 8111-C, such determination or redetermination shall be deemed
to have been also made by the Secretary of the Borough of Swarthmore, and there
shall be due and owing to the Borough, as additional transfer tax, the amount
determined or redetermined by the Department to be due the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
   Upon a redetermination of the amount of realty transfer tax due by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Recorder shall re-record the document only

commencing January 1, 2008; upon the privilege of engaging in an occupation
with a primary place of employment within the Borough during the tax year. Each
natural person who exercises such privilege for any length of time during any

dollars ($52.00) assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the

This tax is in addition to all other taxes of any kind or nature heretofore
levied by the Borough. The tax shall be no more than fifty-two dollars ($52.00)
on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which a person maybe employed.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.03  EXEMPTION AND REFUNDS.
   (a)   Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough is less than twelve thousand dollars ($12,000)
for any calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are exempt
from payment of the tax:
      (1)   Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or
has a service-connected disability declared by the United States Veterans'
Administration or its successor to be a total one hundred percent disability.
      (2)   Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the taxable year. 
For the purposes of this paragraph, reserve component of the armed forces'
shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United
States Marine Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air
National Guard.
   (b)   Procedure to Claim Exemption.
      (1)   A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the Borough and with the
person's employer affirming that: the person reasonably expects to receive
earned income and net profits from all sources within the Borough of less than
twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in the calendar year for which the exemption
certificate is filed; the person has been declared to be a total one hundred
percent disability pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) hereof; or the person is a
member of a reserve component pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) hereof.  In the
event the Borough utilizes a tax collector, as defined herein, it shall provide
a copy of the exemption certificate to that collector.  The exemption
certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay
stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the Borough for the year prior to the
fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the
Borough or except as required by clause (b)(2) hereof, the employer shall not
withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of
the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.  Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees
at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of
hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by
the Borough.
      (2)   With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or
by the Borough that the person has received earned income and net profits from
all sources within the Borough equal to or in excess of twelve thousand dollars
($12,000) in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for
the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the
person of earned income within the Borough in an amount equal to or in excess
of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in that calendar year, an employer shall
withhold the local services tax from the person under clause (b)(3) hereof.
      (3)   If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from
the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under clause (b)(2)
hereof, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar
year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period
after receipt of the notification under clause (b)(2) hereof, a lump sum equal
to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period.  The amount of tax withheld per payroll period
for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same
amount withheld for other employees.  In the event the employment of a person
subject to withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of
tax due, and the Borough may pursue collection under this chapter.
      (4)   Except as provided in clause (b)(2) hereof, it is the intent of
this subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from the local services tax.
   (c)   Refunds. The Borough Council, in consultation with the collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any
tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be
in accord with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of
overpayments and interest on overpayments.  Refunds made within seventy-five
days of a refund request or seventy-five days after the last day the employer
is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the calendar year,
whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest.  No refunds shall be made
for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed one dollar ($1.00).
The Borough Council or the collector shall determine eligibility for exemption
and provide refunds to exempt persons.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.04  DUTY OF EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT.
   (a)   Each employer within the Borough, as well as those employers situated
outside the Borough but who engage in business within the Borough, is hereby
charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each employee engaged by or
performing for such employer within the Borough and making a return and payment
thereof to the Collector.  Further, each employer is hereby authorized to
deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee
is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such services are
performed within the Borough.
   (b)   A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro
rata share of the tax for each pay period in which the person is engaging in an
occupation.  The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a payroll
period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for the
calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for
the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer
shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the
nearest one-hundredth of a dollar.  Collection of the tax shall be made on a
payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
an occupation, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section.  For
purposes of this subsection, combined rate shall mean the aggregate annual rate
of the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
   (c)   No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
   (d)   In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a
principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the
payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the
employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and
the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of
employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall
be provided on the form approved by DCED.
   (e)   The tax shall be no more than fifty-two dollars ($52.00) on each
person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political
subdivisions within which a person may be employed. The Borough shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
   (f)   No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or
for the payment of the withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as
to the employee's place or places of employment, the employee's principal
office or where the employee is principally employed.  Further, an employer
shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount
exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the
provisions of Section
888.03(b) and this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with
this article.
   (g)   Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes thirty
days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.05  RETURNS.
   Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector.  If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to
an employee, except as provided hereafter in this chapter, the employer shall
be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.06  DATES FOR DETERMINING TAX LIABILITY AND PAYMENT.
   In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid
over to the collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each
calendar quarter of each such tax year.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.07  SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.
   Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or
engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of employment
within the Borough shall be required to comply with this chapter and pay the
pro rata portion of the tax due to the collector on or before the thirtieth day
following the end of each quarter.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.08  INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION OR EMPLOYED IN MORE
THAN ONE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period.  In the event
a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one
political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect
the local services tax shall be in the following order:
      (1)   First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
      (2)   Second, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
      (3)   Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
   (b)   In case of dispute a tax receipt of the taxing authority for the
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.09  NONRESIDENTS SUBJECT TO TAX.
   All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside the Borough but who perform services of any type or kind or
engage in any occupation or profession within the Borough do, by virtue
thereof, subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations
promulgated under this chapter with the same force and effect as though they
were residents of the Borough.  Further, any individual engaged in an
occupation within the Borough and an employee of a nonresidential employer may,
for the purpose of this chapter, be considered a self-employed person, and in
the event his or her tax is not paid, the Borough shall have the option of
proceeding against either the employer or employee for the collection of this
tax as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.10  ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
   (a)   A collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Borough Council.
It shall be the duty of the collector to accept and receive payments of this
tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received from each employer
or self-employed person, together with was received.
   (b)   The collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this chapter and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to
municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this
chapter, including provisions for the examination of payroll records of any
employer subject to this chapter, the examination and correction of any return
made in compliance with this chapter and any payment alleged or found to be
incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any
person aggrieved by any decision of the collector shall have the right to
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County as in other cases
provided.
   (c)   The collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an
employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer is
hereby directed and required to give the means, facilities and opportunity for
such examination.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.11  SUITS FOR COLLECTION.
   (a)   In the event that any tax under this chapter remains due or unpaid
thirty days after the due dates set forth above, the collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this chapter with interest and
penalty as provided for in the Municipal Claims and Tax Lien Act or any other
applicable law.
   (b)   If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate
of six percent on the amount shall be calculated beginning with the due date of
the tax and a penalty of five percent shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax
or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable therefore shall,
in addition be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.12  VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this
section, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his
or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject to
this tax who are in his or her employment, or refuses to file any return
required by this section shall be guilty of a violation, and upon conviction
thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than six hundred dollars
($600.00) and costs of prosecution and in default of payment of such fine and

enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in
charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who refuses to
file a return required by this chapter.
(Ord. 1017.  Passed 12-10-07.)
888.13  INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to empower the
Borough to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any occupation not within
the taxing power of the Borough under the Constitution of the United States and
the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
   (b)   If the tax imposed under the provision of this chapter shall be held
by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the Constitution
of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as to
any individual, the decision of the court shall not affect the right to impose
or collect said tax or the validity of the tax so imposed on other persons or
individuals as herein provided.

unless application for installment payments as hereinafter provided is made. No
assessment shall be levied or made payable prior to the date that Borough

Borough Solicitor shall file a municipal claim or lien therefor, together with
interest at the rate of 6% compounded annually from date of completion of the
work.
      (2)   The Treasurer of the Borough shall certify to the Solicitor all
unpaid assessments and the Solicitor shall file municipal claims or liens
therefor in the proper office of Delaware County, as provided by law, against
the property or properties with respect to which such assessment or assessments
have been charged. The Solicitor thereupon shall proceed to collect all such
assessments under general laws relating to collection of municipal claims,
including, if so directed by the Borough, the filing of suit or suits in
assumpsit. In no event shall any municipal claim be filed later than the last
day permitted by law for such filing. Certificates of the Borough Engineer or

   (b)   Any owner or owners of property against which an assessment has been
made shall have the privilege, upon written request, in form specified by the
Borough filed with the Borough within 30 days after notice of assessment has
been given to the property owner and payment of the costs of preparation and
filing of the required lien form, to make payments of such assessment in 20
equal annual installments. The first installment thereof shall be due and
payable within 60 days of the date the assessment is levied pursuant to
division (a) of this section and each subsequent installment shall be due the
same date each calendar year thereafter, together with interest on the balance
due at the rate of interest charged to the Borough by its financing agent, but

Borough from or relieve the Borough of the duty of filing a municipal claim or
lien for every assessment not paid in full within 60 days of service of notice
of assessment for such district improvements.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the filing of such claims, all assessments which are
made payable in installments shall constitute liens and encumbrances upon the
respective benefitted properties at the beginning of each calendar year in an
amount equal to the sum of the annual installment becoming payable in such

shall affect the status of any subsequent installment of the same assessment,

the same in full, at any time, with accrued interest and costs thereon, and
such payment shall discharge the lien of assessment or installments then

wide on either side.
   (b)   "Property line" means the legal side lines of a public street on
either side of the roadway, normally consisting of the curb, the unpaved grass
plot, the paved sidewalk, normally four feet wide, and the remaining unpaved
space extending to the property line. 
(Ord. 715. Passed 3-8-71. )
   (c)   "Sidewalk" means all portions of any public street lying between the
property line and the curb line thereof.
   (d)   "Roadway" means all portions of any public street lying between the
curb lines thereof.
   (e)   "Building material" means any integral part or component substance
actually required in the construction of a building or of sidewalks or
driveways appurtenant thereto. 
(Ord. 268. Passed 6-4-25. )
1020.02  OBSTRUCTIONS AND COMMERCIAL USES GENERALLY; ENCROACHMENTS.
   (a)   With the exception of public signs, barriers, poles, meter stands and
similar Municipal equipment and fixtures, temporary obstructions incidental to

provided in this chapter, no person shall obstruct the free public use of the
streets of the Borough or make any commercial use thereof. Encroachments upon,
under or over public streets are unlawful and may be removed by Borough
officers and/or their agents regardless of how long such encroachments have
existed. This section shall not prohibit Council from making exceptions in the
cases of awnings, signs or other devices where the encroachment is temporary in
nature, is the minimum amount necessary to accomplish the owner's purpose and
does not inconvenience the public or interfere with free passage. 
(Ord. 715. Passed 3-8-71. )
   (b)   No person shall block, obstruct or interfere in any way with the free
passageway over, across and along the full width and length of the paved
portion of any sidewalk in the Borough, except a temporary obstruction
necessitated by an emergency or repairs, in which cases the sidewalk shall be
immediately cleared and left in good order as soon as the necessity for the
obstruction has ceased, and except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
   (c)   No person shall obstruct or occupy the unpaved portion of any sidewalk
of any street, locate any structure therein or pile or store any merchandise,
article or material of any kind thereon, except for the purpose of loading or
unloading the same, except when necessitated by repairs or active building
operations, in which cases the space shall be immediately cleared and left in
good order as soon as the necessity for the occupancy or obstruction has
ceased, and except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

inches to the air corridor above a public sidewalk. Council, however, may
permit trees and shrubs in the sidewalk strip where no walkway exists, but all
such trees and shrubs shall be removed to conform with this section as soon as
Council orders the laying of a paved sidewalk as provided in
Chapter 1024.
   In accordance with the recommendation of the County Planning Commission,
clear sight triangles along the centerlines of intersecting streets shall be
maintained for traffic safety. The sides of such triangles shall be at least
seventy-five feet, measured along the street centerlines from their point of

view, they shall be pruned to restore clear sight in the air space of such
triangles commencing two and one-half feet above the roadway pavement level,
and terminating at least eight feet above the ground at the locations of such
trees or bushes.

receipt therefor, which shall constitute an admission of the violation charged
but shall not excuse a continuing violation.
   (f)   When a person has been notified in the manner set forth in this
chapter and does not avail himself or herself of the penalty provision of

   Commencing January 1, 1969, and for such succeeding years as a contract for
the same may be in force, there shall be Municipal collection, through
independent contractors, of all ashes, trash, rubbish, garbage and other waste
discarded by the owner thereof and placed in proper containers or bundles,
either at the curb, on collection days, or at the rear or side yard of the
premises, depending upon which method of collection is determined by Council,
under the contract initially let to the successful bidder and the automatic
renewal thereof, or under subsequent contracts duly let after the expiration or
sooner termination of such initial contract. 
(Ord. 6'77. Passed 10-23-68. )
1060.02  BIDS AND CONTRACTS.
   The forms of request for bids, specifications and other contract documents
now on file in the office of the Borough Secretary are hereby approved.
Following receipt of bids and Council's determination as to whether collections
shall be made at the curb or from the rear or side yard of the home or business
establishment eligible for such collection at the expense of the Borough, the
proper Borough officers are hereby authorized to execute a contract for the
work with the successful bidder. 
(Ord. 677. Passed 10-23-68. )
1060.03  COST.
   Proper provision for the cost of such service shall be made in the Borough's
budget for 1969 and such succeeding years as a contract for the Municipal
collection of rubbish and trash is in effect. 
(Ord. 677. Passed 10-23-68. )
1060.04  CONTINUING AUTHORITY.
   This chapter shall constitute continuing authority for the proper Borough
officers to renew the original contract from year to year, in accordance with
its terms, or to terminate the same and advertise for new bids based upon such
specifications hereby approved or upon such new specifications and contract
documents as Council, by motion or resolution, hereafter adopts. 
(Ord. 677. Passed 10-23-68. )
1060.05  CHARGES FOR SERVICE.
   (a)   A charge is hereby authorized against the owner of the building or
premises from which rubbish, garbage and other waste matter is removable by the
Municipal collection system herein provided for, whether or not such owner or
his tenant or occupier avails himself of the service. The Health and Sanitation
Committee, with the approval of Council, shall estimate and compute the proper
amount of such charge or charges for the various homes, apartments and
commercial establishments entitled to the service and may, from time to time,
revise the same on the basis of the cost of the service to the Borough.
   A schedule of such charges shall be prepared and placed on file with the
Borough Secretary, together with regulations pertaining to the collection of
such charges and penalties for the nonpayment thereof. 
(Ord. 681. Passed 12-9-68. )
   (b)   For the calendar year 1969 and for each succeeding year thereafter
until changed by Council, a unit charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per
family is hereby levied and assessed against the owner of each private dwelling
house in the Borough. Upon such unit basis, the charge in the case of multiple
dwellings or apartment houses, hotels, boarding houses, churches, schools,
colleges, institutions, restaurants, tea rooms, garages, stores, shops,
offices, or combinations of such structures, shall be computed by the Health
and Sanitation Committee, or another officer or committee authorized by
Council, and collected from the owners thereof as provided in Section
1060.07 et seq. The specifications and regulations referred to herein shall be
construed as one enactment governing the Municipal collection of rubbish,
garbage and other waste material (collectively called "trash") in the Borough.
Such computations, when approved by Council, shall be as effective as those
specifically set forth in this chapter, to the end that the owners of all
properties entitled to the service and included therein shall bear their fair,
proportionate part of the expense of operating the trash collection system. 
(Ord. 686. Passed 3-10-69. )
1060.06  COLLECTION OF CHARGES.
   The Borough Secretary, or another officer authorized by Council, shall
furnish the Tax Collector with an accurate list of those owners of real estate
in the Borough liable for the charges specified in Section
1060.05, and with the respective amounts of such charges. It shall be the duty
of the Tax Collector, either by separate bills or by a space on the general tax
bill, under the heading "Rubbish Collection" or other appropriate title, to
enter such charge against each such owner, as sewer rentals are presently
entered, with corresponding discount and penalty dates.
   Any charges remaining unpaid after the penalty date shall be referred to the
Borough Solicitor for collection as authorized by law. 
(Ord. 681. Passed 12-9-68. )
1060.07  DUTY OF TAX COLLECTOR.
   The Tax Collector is hereby appointed as the officer to collect the annual
charge from the property owners liable for the same, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and is hereby authorized to use all the powers,
rights and remedies now existing or which may hereafter be vested in the Tax
Collector by law for the collection of taxes to collect the annual Municipal
charge imposed by this chapter. It shall be the duty of such officer to cause
proper notices to be mailed or otherwise delivered to the persons or properties
liable for payment of such charges and to refer to the Borough Solicitor such
accounts as may require legal action. Such notices shall be given at the same
time and in the same manner as tax notices are given and collections shall be
remitted to the Borough in the same manner that taxes are remitted. 
(Ord. 686. Passed 3-10-69. )
1060.08  DISCOUNT, SURCHARGE AND INTEREST.
   When payment of the charges provided in Section
1060.05 is made within two months after the date of the notice mailed or
otherwise delivered to the person or property liable for such charges, a
discount of two percent thereof shall be allowed. If such charges are not paid
within four months after the date of such notice, a penalty of five percent
shall be added. Commencing May 1 of the year following that in which such
charge and penalty became payable, interest shall be added to the total amount
thereof at the rate of six percent per year until such indebtedness is fully
paid. 
(Ord. 686. Passed 3-10-69. )
1060.09  COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT CHARGES.
   Annual charges shall be a lien on the property charged with the payment
thereof until paid, collectible as in the case of other Municipal claims,
together with a penalty of ten percent, in addition to the interest and
penalties provided in Section
1060.08. Any delinquent charges may be collected by the Borough Solicitor by
action in assumpsit, as in the case of other Municipal claims. 
(Ord. 686. Passed 3-10-69. )
1060.10  ACCUMULATION OF REFUSE.
   No person shall accumulate or store refuse or other waste material in such a
manner or for such length of time as to be objectionable, unsanitary,
dangerous, unsightly, a fire hazard or an attraction to rodents or other pests.
The public collection system provided by this chapter and other relevant
ordinances of the Borough are designed to make any such unreasonable
accumulation unnecessary as to those residents entitled to the service. Those
commercial establishments described in the specifications and regulations which
are not entitled to Municipal collection shall dispose of their own refuse in a
proper and sanitary manner so that liquids or solid matter do not escape and so
that offensive odors are not given off. 
(Ord. 681. Passed 12-9-68. )
1060.11  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   Council may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations from time to time
dealing with exemptions, exonerations, interpretations and administrative
procedure in connection with the subject matter of this chapter. 
(Ord. 686. Passed 3-10-69. )
1060.12  RECYCLABLE MATERIALS. (REPEALED)

shall constitute a nuisance, may be abated by proceeding against the violator
in a court of equity for relief.
(Ord. 843a.  Passed 9-14-87.)
1062.08  PROMULGATION OF RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The collection of Municipal solid waste in the Borough and the disposal
thereof shall be subject to such further reasonable rules and regulations as
may from time to time be promulgated by the Borough Council, including, but not
limited to, regulations as to the form of license applications, the fee to be
charged for the license and the terms of licenses and license issuance
procedures, provided, however, that no such rules and regulations shall be
contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the County Solid Waste Plan or
applicable law.
(Ord. 843a.  Passed 9-14-87.)
1062.09  AMENDMENT OR REPEAL OF CHAPTER; USE OF SOLID WASTE FACILITY REQUIRED.
   The Borough reserves the right to amend this chapter or repeal it at any
time, provided that the requirement for use of the designated solid waste
facility for disposal of Municipal solid waste from the Borough shall not be
amended or repealed without the prior express written approval of the county
during the term of the contract between the County (or Delaware County Solid
Waste Authority) and Contractor providing for the construction and operation of
the Plant, which contract shall have a term of twenty-five years.  For the
purposes of securing the Contractor's financing, such requirement shall be
deemed to be a contract between the County, the Contractor and the Borough,
which the Borough (subject to the terms of the joint cooperation agreement set
forth in Section
1062.10) agrees to enforce so that the Municipal solid waste from the Borough
will be available to provide a source of energy for the Plant.  The Borough is
not now a collector; if in the future it becomes a collector, it agrees to
deliver all such Municipal solid waste to the Plant.
(Ord. 843a.  Passed 9-14-87.)
1062.10  JOINT COOPERATION AGREEMENT.
   (a)   The Borough agrees to deliver or cause to be delivered during the term
of this agreement all Municipal solid waste generated with the Borough for
disposal at a facility designated by the County.
   (b)   The County agrees to accept for disposal all such Municipal Solid
Waste described in subsection (a) hereof upon completion and commencement of
operation of the Plant in accordance with a contract, containing terms
satisfactory to the County, with the contractor, providing for construction and
operation of the Plant.
   (c)   The term of this agreement shall be for a period of twenty-five years,
and said term shall commence on January 1, 2017.  The Borough, at its option,
may terminate this agreement with thirty days' written notice to the County, in
the event that the Borough will incur substantial costs over and above the
costs generally accepted by the other municipalities in delivering Municipal
solid waste to the County during the term of this agreement; provided the
Borough has first obtained final approval from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources (DER) for its own plan under the Pennsylvania Solid
Waste Management Act of 1980, as amended (35 P.S. 6018.101 et seq.), or an
approval from DER for a modification that brings the Borough under another plan
that has already obtained final approval.  It is understood, however, that
(upon any such termination of this agreement by the Borough) the County, the
Delaware County Solid Waste Authority and/or the County's Contractor shall be
relieved of any responsibility to accept and dispose of Municipal solid waste
generated within the Borough.  It is further understood that any such
termination of this agreement by the Borough shall constitute a repeal, whether
express or implied, of Section 1062.11.
   (d)   The County shall hold harmless and defend the Borough from any suit,
claim or action against the Borough, challenging the legality of this chapter. 
In the event that any such suit, claim or action is brought against the
Borough, the Borough shall authorize the County, through its designated legal
counsel, to defend against the same and the Borough shall cooperate with the
County in said defense and shall give the County Solicitor notice of any such
suit, claim or action within five days of the Borough receiving notice thereof.
(Ord. 843a.  Passed 9-14-87; Ord. 1077.  Passed 6-13-16.)
1062.11  ADOPTION OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   (a)   The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (DER) has
recommended that the requirements of the Pennsylvania Solid Waste Management
Act of 1980, as amended (35 P.S. 6018.101 et seq.), can best be accomplished on
a County-wide basis.
   (b)   The Borough, by formal resolution dated April 9, 1984, authorized the
County to prepare the Solid Waste Management Plan on the Borough's behalf.
   (c)   The County, through the staff of its Public Works Department, its
Planning Commission, and Charles M. Harris and Associates, Inc., consulting
engineers, prepared a Ten-Year Plan for Solid Waste Management.
   (d)   The appropriate officials of the Borough have reviewed the findings
and recommendations of the Plan as it affects this Borough, have found the Plan
acceptable and have recommended that the Plan be adopted.
   (e)   The Borough, accordingly, hereby accepts and adopts the Solid Waste
Management Study prepared by the County as the Ten-Year Plan for Solid Waste
Management required by such Act.
   (f)   The County is hereby authorized to submit the Plan to DER for the
final approval on behalf of the Borough.
(Ord. 843a.  Passed 9-14-87.)
1062.12  SEPARABILITY.
   If any part of this chapter is for any reason found to be illegal or
invalid, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining
parts of this chapter, which shall continue to be fully operative as if the
illegal or invalid part had not been enacted.
(Ord. 843a.  Passed 9-14-87.)
1062.13  EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter shall become effective immediately.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Borough shall have neither the right nor the obligation to
dispose of its Municipal solid waste at the Plant which is contemplated under
this chapter until said Plant is constructed and fully operational.

1240.01  SHORT TITLE.
   This Title Four - Zoning shall be known and may be cited as the “Borough of
Swarthmore Zoning Code of 1976,” or just “the Zoning Code.”
(Ord. 774. Passed 8-23-76.)
1240.02  STATEMENT OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES.
   This Zoning Code, its amendments and supplements, embody a comprehensive
plan designed to promote and facilitate the coordinated and practical community
development of the Borough in a manner consistent with law and the public
interest in achieving and retaining the following general goals:
   (a)   The Land.  To preserve the open space that the Borough now has and
remain essentially a nonindustrial, residential, “green college town,” with
limited commercial areas. The land use provisions hereof are long-range
guidelines to insure optimum and compatible land use in the Borough.
      (1)   Residential.  To maintain and improve established housing and
establish principles for a range of residential use suited to the Borough's
population mix and democratic traditions and to provide for strict control of
the subdivision of existing lots to avoid crowding and injury to adjoining and
nearby developed properties;
      (2)   Commercial.  To encourage the most economically sound land use of
the business district so that it may serve the multiple purposes of
neighborhood shops, services, offices and apartments, with easy access and
convenient parking;
   (b)   The People.  To have the population consist of a stimulating mix of
peoples from all economic, social and educational backgrounds, and of all ages,
races and creeds; and
   (c)   The Life.  To promote and protect the comfort, safety, convenience and
amenities in the community and its social, cultural and aesthetic values and to
improve governmental processes.
(Ord. 774. Passed 8-23-76.)
1240.03  SCOPE AND INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   The use of all land and every building or portion of a building
erected, altered, added to or relocated, and every use within a building or use
accessory thereto in the Borough, shall be in conformity with the provisions of
this Zoning Code. Any existing building or land not in conformity with the
regulations herein prescribed shall be regarded as nonconforming but may be
continued, extended or changed subject to the special regulations herein
provided for nonconforming buildings or uses.
   (b)   The provisions of this Zoning Code shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the Borough. Whenever these requirements are at variance with any
other lawfully adopted rule, regulation, ordinance, deed restriction or
covenant that particularly refers to area and bulk regulations and that imposes
higher standards, the most restrictive requirement shall govern.
(Ord. 774. Passed 8-23-76.)
1240.04  SEPARABILITY.
   Should any court of competent jurisdiction decide that:
   (a)   Any section or provision of this Zoning Code is unconstitutional or
invalid, such a decision shall not affect the validity of the Zoning Code as a
whole or any part thereof other than the part so decided to be unconstitutional
or invalid; or
   (b)   The application of any provision of this Zoning Code to any premises
is unconstitutional or invalid, such a decision shall be limited to the person,

5-13-19.)
1256.03  DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS.
   The following dimensional standards shall apply within the Town Center (TC)
Zoning District:
   (a)   Building Placement.
      (1)   Setback from the street.
         A.   Build-to line.  A building shall have a minimum front yard
setback of zero feet and a maximum setback of five feet from the front property
line.  A setback may be increased to twenty feet from the front property line
for the purposes of a courtyard, plaza, square, recessed entrance, or an
outdoor dining area adjacent to the public street.  Parking lots, driveways,
loading zones, and auto-related areas may not be located at or in front of the
build-to line, except that a hotel or inn may have a drop-off area in front of
its primary entrance.

      (4)   Setback from rear lot line.
         A.   There is no minimum rear yard requirement.
   (b)   Maximum combined lot coverage and hardscape coverage shall be 100%,
but in no case shall lot coverage exceed the maximum allowed for the zoning

   (c)   Floor Area Ratio (FAR).
      (1)   The floor area used in calculating the FAR shall include enclosed
accessory structures, porches enclosed on three or more sides, shafts used for
mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment, bay windows, and habitable attic
floor area.  An attic shall be considered habitable if it has: 1) a code-
compliant stairway as a means of access; and 2) is lawfully designed and/or
used for living or sleeping.  The floor area used in calculating the FAR
excludes chimneys, decks and patios, unenclosed porches, exterior steps and
ramps, and uninhabitable attic floor area.
      (2)   The maximum FAR is 2.5.
      (3)   If the new building is mixed use, combining residential with non-
residential uses, and at least fifty percent of the required parking is below
grade or provided in an enclosed garage not visible from any street on which
the façade fronts, the maximum FAR is 4.0.
   (d)   Building Height.  Notwithstanding any other definitions in the Borough
Zoning Code, the height of a building with a low slope roof shall be defined as
the vertical distance from grade at the front of the building to the top of the
roof parapet.  The height for a building with any other type of roof shall be
determined as set forth in the definition of "height" in this zoning ordinance.
For buildings where the grade along the front of the building slopes, the
vertical distance shall be measured from the highest elevation along the front
of the building.
      (1)   Buildings shall be at least two stories in height at the principal
front façade with a minimum height of twenty-six feet.
      (2)   The maximum building height for a principal building shall be
thirty-five feet.  The height can be increased to the lesser of five stories or
sixty-five feet, if there is a ten-foot setback (on average) of the principal
front façade above thirty-five feet.
(Ord. 1056.  Passed 11-12-13; Ord. 1087.  Passed 10-15-19.)
1256.04  DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Goals of Design Standards.  The overall goal of these design standards
is to maintain and build upon the positive qualities of the Borough's Town
Center while maintaining and enhancing the Borough's traditional community
character and pedestrian-oriented development.  The principles guiding the
administration of these standards are as follows:
      (1)   Buildings should complement the pattern of the existing landmark
structures and have a building fabric and relate to their site and
surroundings, noting in particular that the existing streetscape is
characterized by continuous street walls and multiple storefronts.
      (2)   Buildings should respond at street level to a pedestrian scale and
encourage visual access and active uses at the ground floor.
      (3)   Emphasis should be provided at prominent locations to buildings:
         A.   With prominent façades that terminate view corridors;
         B.   Whose corners are at gateway locations; or
         C.   That either surround or are surrounded by open space.
      (4)   New and existing development should have a complementary character.
      (5)   Texture and variety should be provided through façade articulation
and composition.
      (6)   Architectural expression should be provided in windows, doors,
walls, and roofs.
      (7)   Pedestrian pathways should be provided that are safe and attractive
and that accommodate a high volume of pedestrian traffic.
      (8)   Street trees and shade trees should be employed to enhance
development.
   (b)   Façade Articulation.  Façade articulation is a series of small
setbacks and projections in the overall street wall.  Articulation breaks the
scale of the building into an aggregate of smaller forms, introduces rhythm,
and relates to the human scale, without detracting from the overall sense of a
consistent street wall.  All new, renovated or expanded buildings shall comply
with the following standards:
      (1)   The main façade of buildings shall be designed to emphasize
entryways, windows, corners, and vertical elements of the building façade, as
well as other special features.
      (2)   The massing of all buildings shall be deemphasized through the use
of projecting and recessed elements, such as porches, windows, and roof dormers
to reduce overall bulk and volume, enhance visual quality and contribute to
human-scale development.
   (c)   Façade Composition.  Façade composition is the arrangement of
materials and details to distinguish the components of a building, particularly
its base and top.  All new, renovated or expanded buildings shall comply with
the following standards:
      (1)   All new building facades shall be built to the scale of other
buildings on the street.
      (2)   The design shall distinguish and emphasize the building's base and
top, and reinforce the scale of the street for the pedestrian. 
      (3)   All buildings shall articulate the line between the ground and
upper floors with a cornice, canopy, balcony, arcade or other visual device.
   (d)   Ground Floor Façade.  The ground floor is the primary zone of
interaction for pedestrians on the street and includes the elements of
doorways, access points and window transparency.  All new, renovated or
expanded buildings shall comply with the following standards:
      (1)   The primary pedestrian entrance shall be placed along the build-to
line of the dominant street and not the rear or side of the building. 
Additional pedestrian access points may be located along other façades.
      (2)   When buildings are located on street corners, primary entrances
shall be located on the corner with an appropriate building articulation, such
as a chamfered corner, turret, canopy, or other similar building feature. If
such design is not feasible, the building shall be most prominent on the
primary street.
      (3)   Lobbies and retail spaces shall be clearly connected to the outdoor
environment and visible from the street.
      (4)   All primary building entrances shall be accentuated.  Entrances
permitted include recessed, protruding, canopy, portico, or overhang.
      (5)   Ground floor windows shall be at street level and allow pedestrians
to see the activity inside the building.
   (e)   Architectural Elements.  The architectural design of buildings should
complement the scale and proportion of surrounding buildings, celebrate
innovative design, and be varied in context.  Windows at the ground floor are
important in activating the building and encouraging pedestrian traffic. All
new, substantially improved or expanded buildings shall comply with the
following standards:
      (1)   Windows and doors: primary front façade.
         A.   The ground floor of the primary front façade shall contain
between sixty-five percent clear windows and doors and be complementary in
design to existing properties in the Town Center District.
         B.   Bronze glass, highly reflective glass, tinted or black and smoked
glass is prohibited.
         C.   Windows above the ground floor on the primary front façade of new
or expanded buildings shall be clear and occur in a wall-to-window ratio of
.75:1 to 1.25:1 along the horizontal width of the façade to result in a pattern
of solid wall buildings with punched windows.
         D.   The maximum sill height of sidewalk-facing ground floor windows
shall be two feet above the height of the finished ground floor.
         E.   Ground floor window heads shall be nine feet to twelve feet above
the height of the finished ground floor.
         F.   The top of the display window shall be at least as high as the

      (3)   Sidewalks shall conform to the overall design pattern of existing
sidewalks in the Town Center.
   (b)   Streetscape and Green Area Standards.  The pre-development streetscape
along the property shall be restored or recreated.  This shall include the
replacement of existing street trees, plantings, planters, street amenities,
including furniture, sidewalks, paver strips and curbs.  If there is no
existing streetscape along a frontage, the streetscape shall relate to the
streetscape along the other frontages of the property, including the
installation of street trees, plantings, planters, street amenities, including
furniture, sidewalks, paver strips and curbs.
   (c)   All wall-mounted mechanical, electrical, communication, and service
equipment, including satellite dishes and vent pipes shall not be located on
the street facing façade of a building if another location option is available
on the property, and shall in all cases be screened from public view.

      (1)   All properties are required to provide space for refuse receptacles
(trash and recycling) on the site.
      (2)   The storage of refuse shall be provided inside of the building or
within an outdoor enclosed area enclosed by either walls or opaque fencing
unless such refuse area is at the rear of the property and acceptably shielded
from view by other methods and such enclosure would prevent the shared use of
the site with on-site parking.  Any refuse storage area outside of the building
and screened by a fence or enclosure shall be designed to be architecturally
compatible with the building.
      (3)   For multi-occupant buildings, refuse receptacle storage shall be
consolidated into a single area.

outlined in Section
1264.11, this chapter and the building code in effect from time to time in the
Borough.  Any application for demolition shall be subject to the following
regulations.
   (a)   In order for a building of historic value, as defined in the Borough
of Swarthmore Zoning Code, to be demolished, one of the following two
conditions must be demonstrated:
      (1)   The building is structurally unsound and cannot be stabilized in an
economically feasible manner as determined by a Professional Engineer; or
      (2)   Demolition of the building will not have a substantial negative
effect on the character of the Town Center.
   (b)   The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC) shall be

thirty days prior to request for demolition.  The applicant must provide
documentation of notification to the PHMC.
   (c)   Zoning Permit.
      (1)   No permit for demolition shall be approved until the applicant has
received a zoning permit for a new building that demonstrates compliance with
all codes of the Borough of Swarthmore.  The applicant must also provide
documentation to the Borough of the financial capability to begin construction
of the new building within sixty days of completion of the demolitions and
provide a timeline for construction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the above, it shall not be necessary to obtain a
zoning permit prior to demolition for a new building where demolition is
necessitated by casualty (such as by fire or natural disaster) that was not
caused by the owner of the property or when the demolition is required due to
enforcement of Borough regulations, including but not limited to the
Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code (UCC) and any adopted version of the
International Property Maintenance Code.
   (d)   In all cases where more than sixty days elapse between completion of
demolition and start of construction of a new building, the property owner
shall be required to clear all debris from the property and provide for
landscape materials and grass seeding or grass sodding to provide full grass
coverage of the lot.  The owner shall be responsible for proper maintenance of
all landscape materials until such time that new building construction begins.

1256.07  REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   Any applicant who seeks to change the use of a building, construct a
building, construct an addition to an existing building, alter a façade, or
erect a fence or wall within the Town Center (TC) Zoning District shall submit
an application for a zoning permit on a form provided by the Borough.  Permits
for demolition must follow the conditional use application procedures outlined
in Section
1264.11.
   (a)   The application shall be submitted to the Zoning Officer.  The Zoning
Officer shall review the application for completeness.
   (b)   The application shall include sufficient information in the form of
architectural elevations and sketches of buildings in order to determine to
what extent the applicant complies with the requirements of this chapter.
   (c)   If the Zoning Officer determines that the proposed use, construction
or alteration complies with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, the
Zoning Officer shall approve and issue a zoning permit to the applicant.  If
the Zoning Officer determines that a proposed use, construction or alteration
does not comply with this Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning Officer shall reject the
application for a zoning permit.  In the event that the Zoning Officer
determines that a proposed use, construction or alteration complies with all of
the requirements of Sections
1246.02 (Permitted Uses),
1246.03 (Dimensional Standards),
1246.05 (Other Requirements), but that it does not comply with the requirements
of Section
1246.04 (Design Standards), then the Zoning Officer may elect to either (i)
reject the application or (ii) refer the application to the Planning
Commission.
   (d)   The Planning Commission shall review any such application which is
referred to it by the Zoning Officer pursuant to subsection (c) above within
sixty days of receipt of the application.  The purpose of the review is to
advise the Zoning Officer as to whether the application complies with the
intent of the Zoning Ordinance.  The Planning Commission shall either recommend
approval or recommend alternatives to the applicant.
   (e)   As part of the review, the Planning Commission shall consider the
historic value of the building.
   (f)   The Planning Commission shall issue its written review of the
application within thirty days of completing its review.  If the Planning
Commission does not recommend approval of the application, the applicant may
resubmit the application, with revisions, and the Planning Commission shall
conduct a new review.  The Planning Commission shall issue its written review
of the revised application and recommendation for approval or rejection within
thirty days following completing its review of the revised application.  The
Zoning Officer shall then approve or reject the revised application no later
than seven days following the expiration of the Planning Commission's thirty
day period for reviewing the revised application.

strategy. The Borough believes that certain additional commercial development
adjacent to the existing TC Town Center District is a highly desirable
component of that plan.  Therefore, a new district, to be called IN–C
Institutional Commercial District (hereinafter referred to as the “Overlay
District”) is hereby created as a portion of the existing IN Institutional
District. The intent is to preserve the IN Institutional District zoning in
this district while specifically permitting commercial development consistent
with the Borough’s revitalization plan.
   (c)   It is the intention of Borough Council that any commercial development
in the Overlay District should extend and enhance the character of the existing
townscape design concepts within the adjacent TC Town Center District.  The
design of the various structures, including their materials and proportions and
the vertical and horizontal subdivision of their masses shall be a continuation
of and compatible with the existing townscape along South Chester Road between
Rutgers and Park Avenues.
   (d)   It is further the intention of Borough Council to permit commercial
development only to the extent that such development and related site
improvements, including pedestrian and traffic circulation, parking, hard and
soft landscaping, lighting and heights of all the structures, are a
continuation of and compatible with the existing townscape and serve as a link
between the town center and the college.
   (e)   It is further the intention of Borough Council that any commercial
development be able to accommodate future possible enlargement and enhancement
of existing pedestrian access between the north and south parts of the College
campus and between the campus and the Swarthmore Town Center.
   (f)   It is further the intention of Borough Council that any commercial
development: 1) provide adequate parking for the users of the commercial
facilities; 2) provide for the replacement of all public parking which might be
displaced because of any commercial development; and 3) share available public
parking in the Town Center by making reasonable use of underutilized public
metered parking, while not imposing any additional burden on residential
streets in the Borough.

1264.05  FENCES.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to protect the health, safety
and welfare of all Borough residents and visitors and to maintain the character
of the community.  This section is intended to address residents' legitimate
needs to provide safety and privacy where conditions warrant, while, to the
extent possible, retaining Swarthmore's traditional sense of openness and
community cohesion.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   The requirements of this section apply to fencing as defined
below.  Retaining walls are regulated by the Borough Building and Housing Code,
and are not regulated by this section.
      (2)   All fences not permitted or otherwise regulated herein are
prohibited.
   (c)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
      (1)   "Boundary fence" means a permanent barrier that is more than
eighteen inches in height and more than three feet six inches in length lying
parallel to the property line for the purpose of enclosing or separating a
parcel of ownership, including earthen berms but not planted living material.
Walls, except retaining walls, are included in this definition.
      (2)   "Building line" means an imaginary line running along the front or
rear façade of a principal building on a lot and extending on either side of
the principal building the full width of the lot.
      (3)   "Deer fence" means a fence intended to prevent deer from entering
an area that is constructed of dark, heavy-weight open mesh plastic material
ranging from 1.5 inches x 1.5 inches and 2 inches x 2.5 inches that allows a
clear view through the fence.  Posts may be constructed of wood, metal, or
fiberglass.
      (4)   "Major arterial street" means Baltimore Pike.
      (5)   "Open and solid fences" means a fence shall be considered "open" if
every segment of the fence (e.g. a section between posts) is composed of at
least fifty percent open spaces and no more than fifty percent solid
materials.  All other fences are considered "solid" fences.
      (6)   "Privacy or utility fence" means a permanent barrier located within
a lot which separates, encloses or blocks from view a portion of a lot.
      (7)   "Retaining wall" means a wall for sustaining a bank of earth liable
to erosion that does not exceed the height of earth intended to be supported.
      (8)   "Streets of high traffic density" means Fairview Avenue, Michigan
Avenue, Swarthmore Avenue, Chester Road, Yale Avenue, and Cedar Lane from
Baltimore Pike to Swarthmore Avenue.
   (d)   General Design Standards.
      (1)   As a general design principle, owners are encouraged to consider
the design, style and materials of the principal structure on the property when
choosing the style and type of fence they intend to erect. Acceptable materials
are brick, wood, stone, concrete (except concrete block that has not been
coated) and metal (except non-coated chain link) or other material that
provides a reasonable duplication of such materials. 
      (2)   All fences shall be maintained in good repair and safe condition. 
No fence with barbed wire, spikes, exposed nails or other sharp objects shall
be permitted. No fence with any type of electrical current is permitted,
provided, however, that a buried pet electronic confinement system shall be
permitted.
      (3)   All fences shall be erected with the finished side facing the
adjacent property or street.  For a wood or metal fence, this shall mean that
the finished side shall be considered the side without the structural
supporting members.  For fences made of any other material, the finishes must
be equal on both sides.  The tops of decorative post caps and finials may
exceed the maximum permitted height for the fence by up to six inches.
      (4)   Fences shall be maintained and installed so that they are straight
and do not sag, lean in any direction, or extend over the property line outward
from the lot into a right-of-way or other pedestrian-accessed area on which the
fence or wall is located.  Gates or other points of entry in fences and walls
shall not swing outward across the property line.
      (5)   Fences shall be erected only at the natural grade of the property
and shall not be erected on berms or artificial mounds.  No fence shall impede
the natural flow of water in any watercourse, ditch or swale.
      (6)   No fence shall constitute an obstruction to vision as described in
the Borough Zoning Code and/or Building and Housing Code or the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code.
      (7)   Except as permitted below in A. and B., no fence of any kind is
permitted within fifty feet of the centerline of any street.
         A.   Properties with yards that are adjacent to a major arterial
street shall be permitted fences that are eight feet in height in the yard that
abuts such major arterial street.  Such fences may be "solid" fences as defined
in this section.
         B.   As a special exception, properties with front yards that are
adjacent to streets of high traffic density shall be permitted fences that are
three feet six inches in the front yard abutting the street of high traffic
density.
         C.   Fences allowed under this paragraph (7) shall be subject to the
following additional regulations:
            1.   All fences shall be set back a minimum of four feet from the
right-of-way line of the abutting street, but at least four feet from the edge
of the sidewalk closest to the dwelling.  This four foot strip is intended as a
planting area.
            2.   During the next fall or spring immediately following the
installation of the fence, vegetation shall be planted so that, when the
plantings mature, at least one-half of the full length of the fence will be
screened from view from the street.  Such plantings shall thereafter be
maintained.
            3.   Such fences shall not in any way create an obstruction to
vision as specified in paragraph (d)(6) hereof.
   (e)   Location and Height Restrictions for Boundary Fences.
      (1)   A.   A boundary fence must be located within five feet of a side or
rear property line, except that a fence intended to enclose a yard may be
extended at a right angle from the property line providing that the fence
extension is located at or behind the rear building line of the principal
building.
         B.   By special exception, a fence intended to enclose a yard may be
extended from the boundary fence at a right angle, or similar, from the
property line and may be located in front of the rear building line if the
following conditions are met:
            1.   The extended segment of the fence is no more than four feet
high and is a minimum of fifty percent open.
            2.   The extended segment of the fence is located at or behind the
rear corner of a structural wall of the principal building on a lot.  A
structural wall is one that supports a significant roof mass of the building.
            3.   The extended segment of the fence is located a minimum of
twenty-five feet in back of the street-facing facade of the principal building.
            4.   Not later than the fall or spring immediately following the
installation of the fence, vegetation shall be planted so that, when the
plantings mature, at least one-half of the full length of the extended segment
of the fence will be screened from view from the street.
      (2)   The maximum height of any boundary fence, except those limited
under paragraph (d)(7) hereof, shall be six feet.
      (3)   Any boundary fence greater than four feet in height must be an
"open" fence.  Any fence four feet in height or less may be a "solid" fence.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d)(7) and (e)(2)
above, the owner of a residential property whose side and/or rear yard abuts a
commercial or institutional use property, a commercial HVAC unit or permanent
dumpster location, or railroad right-of-way, or a multi-family dwelling with
more than four units, may erect a "solid" boundary fence to screen such use
having a maximum height of eight feet, with its finished side facing the
owner's residential property.
   (f)   Location and Height Restrictions for Other Fences.
      (1)   A privacy or utility fence of up to six feet in height of either
solid or open design is permitted subject to the following:
         A.   The fence cannot be located in front of the front building line.
         B.   The fence meets the rear and side yard setback requirements for
primary structures in the applicable zoning district in which the fence is
located.
      (2)   A deer fence is permitted subject to the following:
         A.   The fence is located at least ten feet from the side and rear
property lines and is not greater than eight feet in height.
         B.   The fence is located behind the rear building line.
      (3)   A fence of no greater than three feet six inches in height is
permitted anywhere on the property so long as it maintains the required
distance of fifty feet from the centerline of any adjoining street.
   (g)   Permits Required for All Fences.
      (1)   A building permit must be applied for, approved, received, and
posted on the property prior to the start of any work other than work required
in connection with performing a survey. The fee for the permit shall be
included in the annual Borough of Swarthmore Permit and Fee Resolution.
      (2)   Before the installation of a boundary fence, the landowner, or the
applicant with the landowner's permission, shall submit a copy of a certified
survey, or photographic proof of boundary markers either installed by a
surveyor or approved in writing by the adjoining property owner, as well as a
detailed plan showing the location of the fence on the property, the type of
the fence, the height from the natural grade, all openings and other related
information with the building permit. The Borough may field inspect the
property prior to issuing or rejecting a permit application to determine the
existing condition of a fence, the placement of boundary markers or other
related conditions.
      (3)   Prior to the installation of any boundary fence, a string line
inspection will be made by the Code Inspector or other designated Borough
official.
      (4)   At no time may a person or persons installing a boundary fence
encroach onto the adjacent property without the written approval of the
adjacent property owner, a copy to be submitted to the Borough office and
attached to the permit.
      (5)   Before a boundary fence is installed, removed, altered or replaced,
the property owner shall give written notice and a copy of the proposed plan to
adjoining property owners. A copy of the written notice shall be given at least
five working days prior to the start of work, and a copy of such notice shall
be attached to the permit application when submitted to the Borough.
   (h)   Non-Conforming Fences.  Any lawful non-conforming fence that is
damaged, destroyed or removed, either in part or in whole, may be reconstructed
provided that all necessary permits for construction shall be applied for
within one year of date of such damage, destruction, or removal and the
reconstruction shall be completed within two years of the date of such damage,
destruction or removal, and provided that the replacement fence is:
      (1)   The same height or lower than the fence that was removed, but in no
case greater than six feet;
      (2)   Constructed of the same material as the fence that was removed,
unless that material is no longer allowed under the provisions of paragraph (d)
(1) hereof, in which case the replacement fence shall be made of the materials
allowed under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) hereof;
      (3)   The same style as the fence that was removed;
      (4)   In the same location as the fence that was removed, except as noted
in paragraph (h)(5) below;

(e.g. stone base or posts) is not included in the allowable size limits for
such signs.  The maximum height for any free-standing sign shall be six feet
from the ground or sidewalk to the top of the sign and shall be set back a

four square feet in size measured by the smallest geometric figure that would
encompass the entire sign.
      (3)   The sign display must remain static for a minimum of five seconds
and require "instantaneous" change of display; e.g., no fading or scrolling in/
out of the message.
      (4)   Electronic signs shall be positioned so as to avoid glare or
reflection into any adjacent property, street, or alley.
      (5)   Display images and/or themes must directly relate to the business

may be erected or displayed only upon the premises referred to in such signs.
Not more than one such sign shall be erected upon the premises at any given
time, provided, however, that premises located on corner lots may have one such
side on each street frontage and the premises shall, in fact, be for sale or
for rent.  The duration of continuous display of such sign shall be limited to
150 days, at the end of which period the sign shall be removed and not again
displayed or replaced unless the Borough Manager, after an investigation and a
finding that the owner has, in good faith, endeavored to sell or rent his or
her premises at a fair, reasonable and market price or rental, grants an
extension of time.  The foregoing restriction shall not be affected by the
substitution of a real estate broker's sign in place of the owner's or by the

been previously permitted, shall be brought into conformance when there is a
change of tenant, use or owner, or when the sign is replaced or is
substantially repaired or altered.
   (x)   Signs no longer in use must be removed by the owner. In making a
determination as to abandonment, the enforcing official may consider, among
other factors, the absence of a current occupational license, the current use
or vacancy of the premises and the relocation of a business.
   (y)   All signs not specifically allowed are prohibited.

1272.01  PURPOSE.
   The provisions of this Zoning Code are intended to guide the future use of
land in tho Borough; existing uses which do not conform to such provisions
shall be classified as nonconforming uses. The purpose of this chapter is to
regulate such uses to restrict further investment in them and to provide a
means whereby such uses can be controlled within the Borough. 
(Ord. 774. Passed 8-23-76. )
1272.02  CONTINUATION AND MODIFICATION.
   (a)   Continuation. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any use,
building or structure lawfully existing at the time of enactment of this Zoning
Code (Ordinance 774, passed August 23, 1976) may be continued, although it is
not in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Discontinuance. If a nonconforming use of land or of a building or
structure ceases or is discontinued for a period of one year or more the
nonconforming use shall be deemed to be abandoned, any subsequent use of such
land, building, or structure shall be in conformity with the provisions of this
Zoning Code.  The vacating of buildings or structures, the nonuse of land,
buildings or structures or the non-operative status of such land, buildings or
structures shall be deemed an intent to abandon such use.
   (c)   Expansion of Nonconforming Uses.  Lawful business, commercial, or
religious nonconforming uses may be enlarged or expanded by special exception,
subject to all of the standards set forth in Section
1264.16  of this Zoning Code. Where such physical expansion or enlargement of
the nonconforming use would violate the dimensional or other physical
requirements of the zoning district in which the use is located, such expansion
or enlargement shall not be permitted except by variance to be granted only
where the Zoning Hearing Board finds that the enlargement is necessary for the
viability of such nonconforming use and that all other standards necessary for
the granting of a variance have been met.  Physical expansion or enlargement
may not extend onto land acquired after the use became nonconforming or onto a
lot not utilized for the nonconforming use at the time the use became
nonconforming.
   (d)   Expansion of Nonconforming Structures.  Where a use is conforming but
the building or other structure in which the use is housed is nonconforming as
to height, setback, lot coverage, area or bulk regulations, minimum lot area,
or other dimensional or physical requirements, such building or structure may
not be expanded or enlarged in respect to those nonconformities.  Such
nonconforming building or structure may be modified, added to, or enlarged, as
long as the modifications, additions, or enlargements conform to all the
regulations of the district in which the use is located.
   (e)   Relocation of Nonconforming Structures.  No nonconforming building or
structure shall be moved, in whole or in part, to another location on the lot
or to another lot, unless every portion of the building or structure to be
moved will conform to the regulations of the district in which it is to be
located.
   (f)   Reconstruction of Nonconforming Structures.
      (1)   Any lawful nonconforming principal structure on a lot that has been
involuntarily damaged or destroyed by casualty to the extent of not more than
50% of its fair market value may be reconstructed in the same location.  All
necessary permits for the reconstruction shall be applied for within one year
of the date of such damage, and the reconstruction shall be completed within
two years of the date of such damage and shall not exceed the height, area, or
volume of the damaged structure, except to the extent permitted by subsection
(d) hereof.  Any lawful nonconforming principal structure that is damaged or
destroyed voluntarily or due to neglect or dilapidation to the extent of more
than 50% of its fair market value may only be reconstructed in compliance with
the zoning requirements of the district in which such structure is located.
      (2)   Any lawful non-conforming accessory building that is damaged,
destroyed or removed, either in part or in whole may be reconstructed provided
that all necessary permits for the reconstruction shall be applied for within
one year of the date of such damage, destruction or removal, and the
reconstruction shall be completed within two years of the date of such damage,
destruction or removal and the replacement accessory building shall be located
on the same footprint as the damaged, destroyed or removed accessory building
and shall not exceed the height or area of the accessory building that was
damaged, destroyed or removed.
   (g)   Nonconforming Parking Conditions.  No lawful business, commercial, or
religious nonconforming uses may be enlarged or expanded in such a manner that
the enlargement or expansion would result in greater nonconformance as to the
number or size of parking spaces required for such use under this Zoning Code.
   (h)   Change. An existing nonconforming use may not be changed to another
nonconforming use of a different character. Whenever a nonconforming use is
changed to a conforming use, such conforming use shall not thereafter be
changed to a nonconforming use.

demonstrate that a designated site cannot be utilized for proper functioning in
the applicant's system.
   (d)   Co-location. If the applicant (excluding amateur radio operators)
proposes to build an antenna support structure (as opposed to mounting the
antenna or antennas on an existing structure), the applicant shall demonstrate
that it has contacted the owners of suitable structures within a one-mile
radius of the location of the proposed antenna support structure for permission
to install the antenna or antennas on those structures, and that such
permission has been denied by all such owners. The Borough Council may deny an
application to construct a new antenna support structure if the applicant has
not made a good-faith effort to mount the antenna or antennas on an existing
structure.
   (e)   Amateur Radio Operators. If the applicant is an amateur radio
operator, the applicant shall demonstrate that any existing antenna on the
applicant's premises cannot be utilized for the proper functioning of the
applicant's system. If the applicant seeks to erect a free-standing antenna,
the applicant shall demonstrate that attaching an antenna to an existing
structure, such as the applicant's dwelling, would be unsuitable for the proper
functioning of the applicant's system.
   (f)   Design. In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures
needed in the Borough in the future, the applicant shall demonstrate that the
proposed antenna support structure is designed to accommodate other

building-mounted wireless communications facilities shall be no higher than
fifteen feet above the structure upon which they are located and (ii) no
wireless communication facility height in excess of 100 feet shall be
permitted.
   (h)   Setbacks From Base of Antenna Support Structure.  In order to insure
that wireless communication facilities are not placed in a manner that will
adversely affect the character of the neighborhoods within which they are
placed, and in order to minimize conflicts between the wireless communication
facilities and surrounding uses, the minimum distances between the base of any
antenna support structure, not placed on an existing structure and not located
on a designated site, or any guy wire anchors and any property line,
residential district boundary line or right-of-way line shall be as follows:
      (1)   If the antenna support structure, including the antenna, does not
exceed the maximum height permitted for buildings in the district, except the
PA Parks District, the setback shall be the same as for a building in the
district.
      (2)   If the antenna support structure, including the antenna, exceeds
the maximum height permitted for buildings in the district, or is in the PA
Parks District, the setback shall be 100% of the height of the antenna support
structure, including the antenna.
      (3)   If the antenna support structure is located adjacent to a
residential district, the setback from the boundary of the residential district
shall be 200% of the height of the antenna support structure, including the
antenna.

that it is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and provide
the Borough Manager with copies of all FCC applications, approvals, licenses,
and site inspection records. All such information shall be accompanied by a
certification signed by the applicant or an officer of a corporate applicant
stating that, after due inquiry, the information being supplied is true and
correct to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief.  The
applicant shall also provide the Borough Manager with copies of all the
applicable Federal laws and regulations with which it is required to comply and
a schedule of estimated FCC inspections.
   (j)   Building Permits. The applicant shall obtain building permits as
required by applicable Borough ordinances and shall comply with all applicable
requirements for inspections and certifications. Permits will be required for
any antenna support structure and for any other construction meeting the
definition of a structure in this Zoning Code.
   (k)   Safety of Antenna Support Structure. The applicant shall demonstrate
that the proposed antenna or antennas and antenna support structure are
designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable national building
standards for such facilities and structures, including, but not limited to,
the standards developed by the Electronics Industry Association, Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Telecommunications Industry Association,
American National Standards Institute, and Electrical Industry Association.
   The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed wireless communications
facility is designed in such a manner that no part of the facility will attract
or deflect lightning onto adjacent properties.
   When an antenna is to be located on an existing structure and the general
public has access to that structure, the applicant shall provide engineering
details to show that appropriate steps have been taken to prevent microwave
binding to wiring, pipes, or other metals. For purposes of this chapter,
"microwave binding" shall refer to the coupling or joining of microwave energy
to electrical circuits, including, but not limited to, power lines and
telephone wires, during which process the transference of energy from one to
another occurs.
   (l)   Soil Report. A soil report complying with the standards of
Geotechnical Investigations, ANSI/EIA-222-E, as amended, shall be submitted to
the Borough Engineer to document and verify that the design specifications of
the foundations for the antenna support structure, and anchors for the guy

operators) shall provide to the Borough a report from a structural engineer
registered in Pennsylvania attesting that the proposed antenna support
structure meets the structural standards offered by either the Electronic
Industries Association or the Telecommunications Industry Association.  The
application also shall provide a report from a structural engineer registered
in Pennsylvania attesting that the construction of the foundation and erection
of the antenna support structure are proper and in accordance with the
applicant's proposal and applicable engineering standards, and, for any
applicant proposing a wireless communications facility to be mounted on a
building or other structure,  a report from a structural engineer registered in
Pennsylvania attesting that the proposed installation will not exceed the
structural capacity of the building or other structure, considering wind and
other loads associated with the antenna location.
   (n)   Visual Appearance.
      (1)   Antenna support structures shall be painted or otherwise treated to
remain free of rust, and the wireless communications facility shall be kept in
good repair. All wireless communications equipment, buildings, and other
accessory facilities shall be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with
the surrounding environment to the extent possible.
      (2)   To the extent any building-mounted antenna is located on a flat-
roofed building, such antenna shall be set back from the edge of the building
on which it is located by at least ten feet.

structure and other equipment, unless the antenna is mounted on an existing
structure. The security fence shall be a maximum of eight feet high. No barbed
wire or razor wire fencing is permitted.
   (p)   Landscaping.  The antenna support structure shall be landscaped to
screen as much of it as possible. Zoning Hearing Board may in its discretion
permit or require any combination of topography, walls, decorative fences, or
other features instead of landscaping if, in the opinion of the Zoning Hearing
Board, such alternative features achieve the same degree of screening as the
required landscaping, as defined below:
      (1)   An evergreen screen shall be required on the outside (the side
opposite the side facing the antenna support structure) of any security fence,
surrounding the antenna support structure and totally screening its base and
any security fence. The evergreen screen shall be a minimum height of six feet
at planting, and shall grow to a minimum of fifteen feet at maturity.

properties. The applicant shall promptly report any outage or malfunction of
FAA-mandated lighting to the appropriate governmental authorities and to the
Borough Manager.
   (t)   Interference. In the event the wireless communications facility causes
interference with the radio or television reception of any Borough resident for
a period of three continuous days, the resident shall notify the owner or the
Borough Manager of such interference and the owner, at the owner's sole
expense, shall thereafter ensure that any interference problems shall be
corrected promptly. Amateur radio operators are exempt from the requirements of
this subsection because of the obligations imposed on them by Part 97,
Subsection 307 C of the Federal Telecommunications Act.
   (u)   Proof of Inspection. The owner of an antenna support structure shall
submit to the Borough Engineer proof of the annual inspection of the antenna
support structure and antenna or antennas by an independent professional
engineer as required by the ANSI/EIA/TLA-222-E Code. Based upon the results of
such inspection, the Borough may require the removal or repair of the wireless
communications facility. In the event this annual inspection is not performed
in a timely manner, the owner shall be subject to civil enforcement proceedings
in accordance with Section 617.2 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code and applicable Borough ordinances.

financial security agreement shall be executed by both the applicant and the
landowner.  At the time of filing of the annual report required in subsection
(v), above, any new owner of the land or of the facility, as well as an
organization utilizing the facility, shall reaffirm the validity of the
financial security agreement and/or execute a new financial security agreement
as may be required by the Borough Solicitor.  If the Borough Zoning Officer
shall find that an abandoned wireless communications facility has not been
removed within sixty days of the cessation of use, said officer shall give
written notice to the owner of the building or premises on which such facility
is located.  Removal of the facility shall be effected within fifteen days
after receipt of the notice.  If such facility is not removed after the
conclusion of such fifteen day period, the Zoning Officer is hereby authorized
to cause the antenna to be removed forthwith at the expense of the owner of the
building or premises on which such antenna is located.  If the escrow or bond
is insufficient to cover the entire cost of removal and disposal, the Borough
may place a lien upon the premises which may be collected in accordance with
the rules for collection of municipal liens.

1286.08 (e), consistent with the terms of the preliminary plan approval and
modified as necessary to reflect the proposal for final approval.
   (e)   Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan.  A
stormwater management plan as required in Section
1286.08 (f), consistent with the terms of preliminary plan approval and
modified as necessary to reflect the proposal for final approval.
   (f)   Landscaping, buffering and screening and lighting plan.  A plan for
landscaping, buffering and screening as required in Section
1286.08 (g), consistent with the terms of preliminary plan approval and
modified as necessary to reflect the proposal for final approval. In addition,
the plan shall include the final design for lighting of the subject property.
(Ord. 961, § 411. Passed 8-13-01.)
1286.12  SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
   The applicant shall execute an agreement, to be approved by the Borough,
before the final plan is released by Borough Council and filed on record. The
agreement shall specify the following, where applicable:
   (a)   The applicant agrees to lay out and construct all streets and other
improvements, including grading, paving, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, street
lights, fire hydrants, water mains, street signs, shade trees, storm and
sanitary sewers, landscaping, traffic control devices, open space areas, and
stormwater management facilities in accordance with the final plan as approved,
where any or all of these improvements are required as conditions of approval.
   (b)   The applicant guarantees completion and maintenance of all
improvements by means of a type of financial security acceptable to the
Borough, as specified in Section
1286.13.
   (c)   The applicant agrees to tender a deed or deeds of dedication to the
Borough for such streets and for such easements for sanitary and storm sewers,
sidewalks, manholes, inlets, pumping stations, and other appurtenances as shall
be constructed as public improvements, provided that the Borough shall not
accept dedication of such improvements until their completion is certified as
satisfactory to the Borough Engineer.
   (d)   Whenever an applicant proposes to establish or to continue a street
which is not offered for dedication to public use, or which is not accepted for
public use, Borough Council shall require the applicant to submit, and also to
record with the plan, a copy of an agreement made with Borough Council on
behalf of the applicant and the applicant's successors and assigns, and signed
by the applicant, which shall stipulate, among other things:
      (1)   That the Borough shall not be responsible for repairing,
maintaining, or snow plowing on any undedicated street.
      (2)   The method of assessing snow plowing, repair, and maintenance costs
and establishment of maintenance and repair schedules for undedicated streets,
which shall be set forth in a recorded road maintenance agreement and deed
covenants for all properties so as to be binding on all successors or assigns.
Lien authority shall be provided to ensure that a majority of owners can
undertake repairs and maintenance and bill all owners.
      (3)   The conditions under which the street may later be offered for
dedication. At a minimum, if dedication is sought, the street shall conform to
applicable Borough specifications.
(Ord. 961, § 412. Passed 8-13-01.)
1286.13  PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   (a)   The applicant shall deposit with the Borough financial security in an
amount sufficient to cover the cost of all improvements (including both public
and private improvements) and common amenities, including but not limited to
streets, walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, shade trees, stormwater
detention and/or retention facilities, pipes and other related drainage
facilities, recreational facilities, open space improvements, buffer or screen
plantings and, except as provided for in division (f) of this section, water
mains and other water supply facilities, fire hydrants, and sanitary sewage
disposal facilities.
   (b)   Financial security required herein shall be in the form of a Federal
or Commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable letter of credit, a
restrictive or escrow account in such institution, or such other type of
financial security that the Borough may, in its reasonable discretion, approve.
   (c)   The financial security shall provide for and secure to the public the
completion of all subdivision improvements for which such security is being
posted on or before the date fixed in Borough Council's formal action of
approval or accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements. The
amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of the
cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted by the applicant and
prepared by a professional engineer, licensed as such in Pennsylvania, and
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost.
Borough Council, upon recommendation of the Borough Engineer, may refuse to
accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant and the Borough are
unable to agree upon an estimate, the estimate shall be determined in
accordance with the terms of § 509(g) of the MPC.
   (d)   In accordance with § 509(f) of the MPC, the amount of financial
security shall be equal to 110% of the estimated cost of completion of the
required improvements (including landscaping, stormwater management, trails,
and any improvement to private properties which are required by the approved
plan) for which financial security is to be posted. If the party posting the
financial security requires more than one year from the date of posting to
complete the required improvements, the amount of financial security shall be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first
anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount not
exceeding 110% of the estimated cost of completing the required improvements as
reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by
using the above procedure for estimating cost.
   (e)   Where development is projected to take place over a period of years,
Borough Council may authorize submission of final plans by section or stage of
development, subject to such requirements or guarantees as to improvements in
the future sections or stages of development as it finds essential for the
protection of any finally approved section of the development, and consistent
with the terms of § 508(4) of the MPC.
   (f)   If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus
or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Borough, financial security to assure
proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with
the regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority, and
shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise required by
this section.
   (g)   As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request Borough Council to release or
authorize to be released, from time to time, such portions of the financial
security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing the
work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to Borough Council, and
the Council shall have 45 days from receipt of such request within which to
allow the Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, that such portion of the
work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the approved
plans. Upon such certification, Borough Council shall authorize release by the
lending institution of an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly
representing the value of the improvements completed. The Borough Engineer, in
certifying the completion of work for a partial release, shall not be bound to
the amount requested by the applicant, but shall certify to Borough Council his
independent evaluation of the proper amount of partial releases. Borough
Council may, prior to final release at the time of completion and certification
by the Borough Engineer, require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the
aforesaid improvements as per Section
1292.03.
(Ord. 961, § 413. Passed 8-13-01.)
1286.14  RECORDING OF FINAL PLAN.
   Within 90 days of the applicant's execution of the subdivision and land
development agreement and performance guarantee, the final plan shall be
recorded by the applicant in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds, and a
copy of the recorded plan shall be furnished to the Borough. If such plan
should fail to be recorded within the specified period of time, and the time
for recording the plan has not been extended by written action of Borough
Council, then the approval thereof shall be considered null and void. Borough
Council may reinstate approval of the plan and authorize its recording where,
following expiration of the 90-day period or any approved extension thereof, no
significant changes to relevant ordinance provisions or to other circumstances
relevant to the proposed plan have been made. Conversely, if Borough Council
finds that such changes have occurred, the original plan approval shall
continue to be null and void.
(Ord. 961, § 414. Passed 8-13-01.)
1286.15  COMMENCEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   No construction or land disturbance activities (not including soil or
percolation testing, well drilling, or similar engineering or surveying
activities) shall be commenced until the applicant submits to the Borough
Manager a copy of the recorded plan.
   (b)   No application for a building permit under the Borough Building and
Housing Code shall be submitted, and no building permit under the Borough
Building and Housing Code shall be issued for any building in any subdivision
or land development, and no work shall be done on any building in any
subdivision or land development until the final plans for the subdivision or
land development have been approved and recorded as provided for, and until the
terms of Section
1286.12(a) have been satisfied. Further, where final subdivision or land
development approval has been conditioned upon the submission and approval of
individual lot grading plans for some or all of the lots, no building permit
shall be issued for construction on any such lot until this condition has been
complied with.
   (c)   No water system or sewer system, including extensions to existing
systems, shall be constructed prior to the issuance of any required permits
from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection or from federal or
local agencies, as required.
(Ord. 961, § 415. Passed 8-13-01.)
1286.16  TIME LIMITATION OF PLANS.
   The approval of any subdivision or land development plan shall be effective
for the five-year period established by § 508(4) of the MPC, as amended from
time to time. The aforementioned section of the MPC shall control any phased
submission and any vested rights that may accrue from the date of preliminary
plan approval.
(Ord. 961, § 416. Passed 8-13-01.)
1286.17  PLAN AMENDMENTS.
   Major modifications of the approved plan, as determined by the Borough,
shall be resubmitted and reprocessed in the same manner as the original plan.
All site disturbance activities shall cease pending approval of modified plans.

1288.01  APPLICATION.
   (a)   The following principles, standards, and requirements shall be applied
in evaluating plans for proposed subdivision and land development. In addition,
the standards set forth in the Zoning Ordinance for the particular district in
which the subdivision or land development is taking place shall govern the
layout of lots and/or design of buildings, parking lots, and other facilities.
   (b)   The standards and requirements outlined herein shall be considered
minimum standards and requirements for the promotion of public health, safety,
and general welfare. Further discussion of the interpretation and authority of
this ordinance and related regulations is contained in Section
1284.01.
(Ord. 961, § 501. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.02  LAND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Land shall be suited to the purposes for which it is to be subdivided
or developed. Proposed land developments shall be coordinated with existing
nearby neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may develop harmoniously.
   (b)   No land shall be developed unless all hazards to life, health, or
property from flood, fire, and disease shall have been eliminated or unless the
plans for the development shall provide adequate safeguards against such
hazards.
   (c)   No plan of subdivision or land development shall be approved that
would result in lots or land use, or that would in any other way be
inconsistent with the Zoning Ordinance then in effect for the zoning district
in which the land to be developed or subdivided is located.
(Ord. 961, § 502. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.03  BLOCKS.
   (a)   The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to:
      (1)   Provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type proposed.
      (2)   Topography.
      (3)   Requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian
circulation.
      (4)   Thoughtful and innovative design to create an attractive community
and opportunities for the utilization of renewable energy sources (e.g.
enabling easy pedestrian and bicycle access, designing blocks to take advantage
of natural features such as large trees or existing topography to minimize
heating and cooling requirements).
   (b)   In design of blocks over 1,000 feet long, special consideration shall
be given to access for fire protection, whether by emergency access easement or
otherwise. Pedestrian crosswalks shall be required every 500 feet. Pedestrian
and bicycle paths shall be required to connect streets every 500 feet.
   (c)   Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two
tiers of lots, unless prevented by the size, topographical conditions or other
inherent conditions of property, in which case the Borough Council may approve
a single tier of lots.
(Ord. 961, § 503. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.04  LOTS AND LOT SIZES.
   (a)   Lot dimensions and area and minimum front yard setbacks shall not be
less than as required by the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   In general, side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or
radial to street lines and shall continue in a straight line from the front of
the lot to the rear of the lot.
   (c)   In general, all lots shall have frontage along the right-of-way line
of a street and direct access to a street or alley, existing or proposed. Each
lot shall have, in addition to the required minimum width at the front lot
line, sufficient free and complete access to an existing or proposed street
cartway to avoid the need to cross any portion of another lot to reach such
street, unless topographic conditions do not permit using said frontage as
stipulated above. Interior flag lots are discouraged but may be permitted if
the applicant can demonstrate sufficient need and/or benefit due to topography
or other conditions.
   (d)   Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where employed as
reverse frontage lots to prevent vehicular access to through highways.
   (e)   Lot frontage shall not be less than the minimum requirement of the
Zoning Ordinance, except that on the outside of a curved residential street a
minimum frontage of 50 feet may be deemed acceptable, provided that proper lot
width is attained at the building setback line in conformity with the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (f)   House numbers shall be assigned to each lot, and street names shall be
approved by the Borough in accordance with established methods.
   (g)   Interior lots.
      (1)   The applicant shall not be permitted to use interior lot design to
avoid constructing or extending streets.
      (2)   An interior lot shall have an access strip, with a minimum width
for its entire depth of 25 feet, which connects to a street.
      (3)   A flag lot shall not be further subdivided without the provision of
direct street access.
      (4)   Any driveway constructed in the access strip connecting the main
portion of a flag lot with a public road shall be provided with full and
adequate drainage facilities, which shall be approved by the Borough Engineer.
(Ord. 961, § 504. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.05  STREET AND SIDEWALK SYSTEM.
   (a)   Proposed streets and sidewalks shall be in conformance with the
Comprehensive Plan of the Borough, considered in relation to existing and
planned streets, and located so as to allow proper development of surrounding
properties. Secondary roads and through highways shall be connected with such
existing roads and highways so as to form continuances thereof. Residential
streets shall generally be laid out in a grid pattern and traffic calming
methods used so as to discourage their use as secondary roads and through
highways. New streets shall be included on the Borough Official Map, and shall
be classified according to their function.
   (b)   Thoughtful and imaginative design of streets and their relationship to
the arrangement and shape of lots is required. Wherever possible, streets shall
conform to topographical conditions, and shall be logically related to the
topography so as to produce usable lots, reasonable grades, proper alignment
and drainage, and shall be connected and shall provide for adequate visibility.
   (c)   The number and location of roads on the interior of a single parcel
undergoing land development must be adequate to meet public safety needs,
including but not limited to access for emergency vehicles.
   (d)   If lots resulting from original subdivision are large enough to permit
resubdivision, or if a portion of the tract is not subdivided, adequate street
rights-of-way to permit further subdivision shall be provided as necessary, to
be no less than the rights-of-way then required for minor collector or local
streets. Remnants, reserve strips and landlocked areas shall not be created.
   (e)   Additional right-of-way and improvements.
      (1)   Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an
existing or proposed major collector or arterial street, the Borough may
request dedication of additional right-of-way to provide the minimum right-of-
way specified hereinafter, as well as marginal access streets, rear service
alleys, reverse frontage lots, or such other treatment as will provide
protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections
with the major street, and separation of local and through traffic.
      (2)   Where warranted because of additional traffic, drainage, or
comparable problem or conditions, both sides of said major street are to be
improved as a responsibility of the applicant, or by means of sufficient funds
escrowed for use by the Borough to execute such improvement.
   (f)   Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except when designed as cul-de-
sac streets.
   (g)   Continuations of existing streets shall be known by the same name, but
names for other streets shall not duplicate or closely resemble names for
existing streets in the region. In all cases, however, all street names are
subject to the approval of the Borough Council.
   (h)   Where streets continue into adjoining municipalities, evidence of
compatibility of design, particularly with regard to street widths, shall be
submitted. The applicant shall coordinate such designs with both municipalities
to avoid abrupt changes in cartway width or in improvements provided.
   (i)   New streets and sidewalks shall be laid out to continue existing
streets as regards both cartway and right-of-way, where such continuations are
reasonable and practical.
   (j)   In residential and commercial areas and all office or industrial
parks, sidewalks and planting strips shall be required on both sides of the
street.
   (k)   Crosswalks may be required where necessary to provide access to
schools, churches, parks, and commercial areas.
   (l)   At the discretion of Borough Council, with recommendations from the
Planning Commission, a system of bicycle, equestrian, and/or pedestrian paths
for public use generally unrelated to and separate from streets shall be
established and secured by dedication or easement. Such paths shall be designed
and located to encourage the formation of interconnecting bicycle, equestrian,
and/or pedestrian networks, both within and beyond the Borough. Such paths
shall normally not exceed ten feet in width and, at the option of the
applicant, shall be located adjacent to existing or proposed lot lines, or in
such manner to minimize any obstruction to development. Existing paths may be
relocated if a connection with a path on an adjoining property is thereby
established.
   (m)   To facilitate circulation, pedestrian walkways may be required to
serve the interior of developments. Such walkways shall be a minimum of four
feet in width and shall be of a durable surface satisfactory to Borough
Council. Where the walks are not within a street right-of-way, a separate
right-of-way at least ten feet wide shall be designated on the subdivision
plan. As appropriate, the walks shall be maintained by the homeowners'
association (when the walks traverse common areas) or by the abutting property
owners (when the walks traverse existing lots).
(Ord. 961, § 505. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.06  CUL-DE-SAC AND OTHER SINGLE-ACCESS STREETS.
   (a)   Cul-de-sac streets are discouraged and shall not be approved when a
through street is reasonably practical.
   (b)   Cul-de-sac streets shall be provided at the closed end with a paved
turnaround having a minimum radius of 40 feet and a minimum right-of-way radius
of 50 feet, and shall not be more than 400 feet in length.
   (c)   The turnaround portion of a cul-de-sac street shall have a maximum
slope of 5% across the diameter in any direction.
   (d)   Cul-de-sac streets with centerline slopes of less than 2% that are
level or nearly so across the diameter perpendicular to the centerline must be
graded so that there is a minimum 2% fall in all drainage swales around the
cul-de-sac.
(Ord. 961, § 506. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.07  STREET AND SIDEWALK WIDTHS.
   (a)   The minimum width right-of-way and minimum width of paving and
sidewalk/ planting strip shall not be less than that of the existing street of
which the new street is to be a continuance or in any event not less than the
following:
 
Type of Street   Right-of-Way Paving Width  Sidewalk Width  Planting Strip
                 Width (feet) (feet)        (feet)          Width (feet)
Through highways 80           50            4               4
Secondary roads  50           30            4               4
Residential      44           24            4               4
 
   (b)   Additional widths for paving, sidewalks, and planting strips may be
required by Borough Council in the interest of public safety and convenience,
including extra width as may be required to permit on-street parking and
bicycle lanes. The location of sidewalks relative to planting strips shall be
at the discretion of Borough Council.
   (c)   Subdivisions abutting existing streets shall provide, for dedication,
the minimum right-of-way widths for those streets in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
(Ord. 961, § 507. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.08  STREET ALIGNMENT.
   (a)   Sight distance.  A sight distance of at least 300 feet shall be
provided, at driver's eye height of 3½ feet, with respect to both horizontal
and vertical alignment.
   (b)   Horizontal curves.  As noted in Section
1288.05 , residential streets shall generally be laid out in a grid pattern.
Curving streets are therefore discouraged. If needed, horizontal curves must be
designed to meet minimum safety standards. Minimum radius curves at the end of
long tangents shall be avoided.
   (c)   Vertical curves.  Vertical curves shall be used at changes in grade of
more than 1%. For proper transition, the length of the curve shall be 25 feet
for each percent of change in grade. Over summits or in sumps, vertical curves
shall not produce excessive flatness in grade.
   (d)   Grade.
      (1)   Maximum and minimum centerline grade.  The maximum centerline grade
of residential streets shall be 10%; and of secondary roads and through
highways 7%; and the minimum grade shall be 1%.
      (2)   Street intersections.  One hundred feet of grade on either side of
an intersection shall not be more than 3%.
   (e)   Curve-grade combinations.  A combination of minimum radius horizontal
curves and maximum grades will not be permitted.
(Ord. 961, § 508. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.09  STREET INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   Right angle intersections shall be used whenever practicable, and
always when residential streets empty into secondary roads or through highways.
There shall be no intersection angle of less than 75 degrees, or more than 105
degrees, measured at the centerline.
   (b)   No more than two streets shall cross at the same point.
   (c)   To the fullest extent possible, intersections with through highways
shall be located not less than 1,000 feet apart, measured from centerline to
centerline. Exceptions shall be those cases deemed to require closer spacing
without endangering the public's safety, as approved by the Borough Engineer.
   (d)   Streets entering from opposite sides of another street shall either be
directly across from each other or offset by at least 150 feet on residential
streets and secondary roads and 400 feet on through highways, or to that
distance required by PennDOT standards, if applicable, measured from centerline
to centerline.
   (e)   Corner curb radii shall be according to the following schedule of
minimum lengths: residential streets and secondary roads, 15 feet; through
highways, 35 feet. Where streets of different functional classifications
intersect, the requirements for the higher classification shall hold.
   (f)   If necessary, the right-of-way line for corner curbs shall be an arc,
concentric with the curb line, with a minimum radius of 20 feet, or shall be a
triangle constructed by drawing the chord of an arc concentric with the curb
line with a minimum radius of 15 feet.
   (g)   All necessary street name signs and traffic control signs shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to provide and erect. The street signs shall be
of the type existing in the neighborhood, shall meet PennDOT safety standards,
and shall be subject to approval by the Borough Council. Street signs and
traffic control signs shall be erected before the issuance of any certificates
of occupancy on that street.
   (h)   Clear sight triangles shall be provided at all street intersections.
On any lot, no wall, fence, sign, or other structure shall be erected and no
hedge, shrub, tree, except for street trees, or other growth over 24 inches in
height above the curb level shall be planted or maintained that may cause
danger to traffic on a street by obstructing the vision of drivers and/or
pedestrians. The triangle of unobstructed vision required at each corner shall
be formed by a diagonal straight line drawn from two points on the curb lines,
each 30 feet from the point of intersection of the two extended curb lines.
   (i)   Intersections shall be controlled by stop signs, except that one
through street may be designated for each intersection, or by traffic signals.
(Ord. 961, § 509. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.10  STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   All materials used in the construction of streets and the methods of
construction and drainage shall be in accordance with the applicable
requirements of the most current PennDOT Specifications, Form 408, and the most
current Borough regulations.
   (b)   Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with current Borough
regulations, including requirements for handicapped access ramps at
intersections and crosswalks.
(Ord. 961, § 510. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.11  PRIVATE STREETS.
   Private streets may be permitted by the Borough Council under the following
circumstances:
   (a)   There is a recorded agreement between the applicant and the Borough,
and in the deed to each lot abutting such street (as stipulated in Section
1286.12) specifying that said streets will not be offered for dedication and
will not be accepted by the Borough unless constructed to Borough standards
then existing at the time of offer of dedication. In addition, this agreement
shall set forth the standards of maintenance and snow removal for the road, the
allocation of costs among lot owners, annual fees and the establishment and
management of major repair funds, provisions for the taking of legal action in
the event of non-payment, and such other provisions as may be deemed prudent to
assure proper safety, maintenance and drainage of the road. Under no
circumstances, however, is the Borough obligated to accept dedication.
   (b)   Unless the street is accepted for dedication, owners and all
successors of property that is to abut a private street shall be fully
responsible for the permanent improvement of the street and for maintenance
thereof in a good and safe condition.
   (c)   Private streets shall adhere to all design standards for a public
street, except for right-of-way width.
   (d)   Lots fronting on private streets shall meet the requirements of the
Borough Zoning Ordinance with regard to lot width and setbacks and off-street
parking.
(Ord. 961, § 511. Passed 8-13-01.)
1288.12  DRIVEWAYS.
   (a)   No more than two dwelling units on separate lots may share a common
driveway. Private driveways shall be so located, designed and constructed as to
provide a sight distance designed according to reasonable engineering standards
at intersections with streets with a stopping space on the drive a minimum
length of 18 feet, with a grade not in excess of 5% behind the right-of-way
line. Excessive driveway grades that may create a hazard at either street or
interior terminus are prohibited. Where difficult problems of driveway
curvature and grades in excess of 10% on residential driveways are likely to be
present, the applicant shall submit for approval details of driveway location
and grade before lot lines and house location and grade are finally determined.
Grades of new residential driveways shall not exceed 14%. Grades of new
commercial driveways shall not exceed 7%. Crossover easements are required and
must be noted on the plan and included on all affected deeds.

be located across a public roadway or other right-of-way from the principal
building or buildings it serves, unless allowed at the discretion of Borough
Council.
   (c)   In commercial and industrial districts, provision of “common parking
facilities” is encouraged in recognition of their increased flexibility and
efficiency. Formal arrangements between the proposed users of the common
parking facilities may be required by Borough Council. When common parking
facilities are approved, access drives and sidewalks shall be so aligned as to
maximize parking efficiency and minimize traffic congestion. Entrances and
exits must have clear sight lines and good visibility so that drivers can see
and cars can be seen while entering or exiting.

   (a)   In reviewing a plan for subdivision or land development, the Borough
Planning Commission shall consider the open space and recreational needs of the
additional residents and/or employees proposed by the development. The Planning
Commission shall discuss its findings and the further requirements of this
section with the applicant as it deems necessary in the public interest.
   (b)   The Council shall determine its preference for the set-aside of land
within the proposed development, or the payment of a fee in lieu of land, in
accordance with the following:
      (1)   In a subdivision or land development proposed to contain 20 or more
single-family detached dwellings, the general policy of Borough Council shall
be to require that the applicant set aside a minimum of one acre per 20
dwelling units, or the proportional equivalent thereof, as common open space
for recreational purposes.
      (2)   In a subdivision proposed to contain fewer than 20 single-family
detached dwellings, the general policy of the Council shall be to require a fee
in lieu of the minimum acreage otherwise required, to help the Borough defray
the eventual costs of providing public open space and recreational facilities
to serve the residents of the community. The fee required shall be as
referenced in
Chapter 1294.
      (3)   Borough Council may, as it deems necessary in individual cases,
modify its position with regard to the above-stated policies in order to
achieve more effectively the objectives of the Borough. In particular, the
Borough may consider the following: proximity of the tract to existing or
proposed public open space areas; the age of the prospective residents; the
natural characteristics of the tract; the size of the proposed lots; and any
existing commitments by the Borough to purchase or improve land for
recreational purposes.
   (c)   In designating areas for open space and recreation within the
subdivision or land development plan, the following criteria and standards
shall be adhered to by the applicant. Areas shall be:
      (1)   Suitable for active recreational uses to the extent deemed
necessary by Borough Council, without interfering with adjacent dwelling units,
parking, driveways, and roads.
      (2)   Comprised of no more than 30% of environmentally-sensitive lands
(including floodplains, woodlands, slopes exceeding 15% and surface waters).
      (3)   Comprised of areas not less than 75 feet in any dimension, and not
less than 15,000 square feet of contiguous area, except when part of a trail
system or pathway network.
      (4)   Interconnected with common open space areas on abutting parcels
wherever possible, including provisions for pedestrian pathways for general
public use to create linked pathway systems within the community.
      (5)   Provided with sufficient perimeter parking when necessary, and with
safe and convenient access by adjoining street frontage or other rights-of-way
or easements capable of accommodating pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle traffic,
and containing appropriate access improvements.
      (6)   Undivided by any public or private streets, except where necessary
for proper traffic circulation, and then only upon recommendation of the
Borough Engineer and Planning Commission.
      (7)   Free of all structures, except those related to outdoor
recreational use or such open space uses as may be permitted by the underlying
zoning district. Stormwater retention or detention basins designed and approved
as part of the stormwater management system for the development may be located
within open space areas, but the area devoted to such facilities shall be
excluded from the calculation of the amount of such open space. Subsurface
recharge areas will not be excluded from open space calculations.
      (8)   Suitably landscaped either by retaining existing natural cover and
wooded areas and/or by a landscaping plan for enhancing open space areas
through plantings which are consistent with the purposes of this section and
which minimize maintenance costs.

road construction and maintenance.
      (1)   Except for driveways serving single-family or two-family dwellings,
nothing shall be constructed, placed, planted, set, or installed within the
area of an easement. The area shall be kept as lawn or, where necessary, as
vegetative buffer.
      (2)   The owner of any lot, upon written request from the Borough, and at
the owner's sole expense, shall remove anything placed, planted, set or
installed (regardless of whether such things were placed, planted, set or
installed with or without knowledge of this regulation) within the area of any
easement.
      (3)   To the maximum extent possible, such easements shall be adjacent to
lot lines.
      (4)   The required minimum setback and yard dimensions for any lot shall
be measured from the lot line, except where the Borough makes a specific
determination that such dimension shall be measured from the edge of an
easement.
   (b)   Easements for stormwater management shall be provided in accordance
with Section
1288.23.
   (c)   The Borough may require easements as prerequisites to the approval of
common driveways or other access arrangements, or as a condition of approval of
the creation of areas of common open space.
   (d)   No right-of-way or easement for any purpose whatsoever shall be
recited or described in any deed unless the same has been shown on the approved
plan and any easement required herein shall be made part of the deeds of all
affected properties. Any error found in a deed shall be immediately corrected
and re-recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds, at the sole
expense of the applicant. The applicant shall be solely responsible to the
buyer for any failure to record an easement shown on the approved plan, but
failure to record an easement shown on the approved plan shall not prevent the
utilization of the easement for its intended purpose.
   (e)   Reserve strips, to control access to streets, alleys, subdivisions, or
adjacent areas, are prohibited.

that will exist after the final subdivision is approved, even if none currently
exists.
      (2)   Additional sidewalks may be required to connect subdivisions or
land developments with surrounding destinations, such as shopping centers,
schools, parks, public transit, and other destinations, so as to reduce the
distance pedestrians have to walk to reach those destinations.
      (3)   The Borough may waive the requirement for installation of the
sidewalks, provided that the applicant pays an amount equal to the cost of
installing sidewalks on the property that is the subject of the development or
subdivision application, as determined by the Borough Engineer, into a fund
directly intended for (i) construction of future sidewalks or pedestrian
crosswalks or (ii) maintenance or improvement of existing sidewalks or
crosswalks in the Borough, at such locations to be decided solely by Borough
Council.
      (4)   Maintenance of sidewalks is the responsibility of the owner of the
property directly adjacent to the sidewalk. Sidewalks which are damaged or
deteriorating and present a hazard to public safety, as determined by the
Borough's Code Enforcement Officer, shall be repaired at the owner's expense. 
A note must be added to the record plan indicating the sidewalk maintenance
responsibilities.  At the discretion of Borough Council, repair and/or
replacement of existing sidewalks to meet current Borough specifications may be
required before filing of the record plan.

individual deeds of properties. Borough Council may require that at least 75%
of the lots in any approved subdivision or land development (or phase thereof,
if final plan approval has been in phases) have certificates of occupancy
issued for buildings thereon prior to acceptance of dedication. Should the
streets, even though constructed according to the specifications of this
Subdivision and Land Development Code, deteriorate before 75% of the lots have
certificates of occupancy issued, such streets shall be repaired in a manner
acceptable to Borough Council before being accepted by the Borough.
   (b)   Where it appears that the 75% occupancy level will be extended beyond
a 12-month period, the applicant may delay placing the final wearing course of

development improvements remain undedicated, with maintenance the
responsibility of individual lot owners, a homeowners' association or similar
entity, or an organization capable of carrying out maintenance
responsibilities.
(Ord. 961, § 705. Passed 8-13-01.)

   (a)   Where Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of the
required improvements following completion (whether such dedication is of the
fee or of an easement), it shall require the posting of financial security to
secure the structural integrity of the improvements and the functioning of the
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on
the final plan. The security shall be in the form as is authorized for the
deposit of the performance guarantee, as described in Section
1286.13, shall be for a term of 18 months from the date of the acceptance of
dedication, and shall be in an amount equal to 15% of the actual costs of
installation of the improvements so dedicated.
   (b)   Where maintenance of stormwater retention facilities or private
streets is to be the responsibility of individual lot owners, a homeowners'
association or similar entity, or an organization capable of carrying out
maintenance responsibilities, Borough Council shall require that maintenance
responsibilities be set forth in perpetual covenants or deed restrictions
binding on the landowners' successors in interest, and may further require that
an initial maintenance fund be established in a reasonable amount.

(Ord. 1044.  Passed 8-8-11.)
1293.05   BUFFERING AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.
   Buffer screens are required to screen lighting glare, noise, and sight views
that are incompatible with the existing character of the surrounding area by
creating a visual and/or acoustic barrier between conflicting land uses.  The
proposed construction shall not detract from the character or desirability of
the surrounding area, and the applicant shall provide and maintain attractively
landscaped grounds or make any other suitable screening provision that is
necessary to adequately safeguard the residential character of adjacent
districts.  Flexibility of development to complement the existing neighboring
properties and the Borough as a whole is a prime objective of this section.
   (a)   The Borough may require buffer areas along rear and side property
lines in non-residential districts which directly abut residential zoning
districts in the Borough or an adjoining municipality.  The buffer should be
sufficient to constitute an effective screen and give maximum protection to the
abutting district.  Such buffer areas may consist of a planting strip of not
less than thirty-five feet in width on which shall be placed shrubbery, trees
or other suitable planting.  However, existing planting, topography, or man-
made structures remaining on the property may be deemed to be partially or
fully acceptable for screening purposes by the Borough.
   (b)   Parking areas in excess of 8,000 square feet shall be buffered from
view from adjacent residential zoning districts.  The buffer shall be opaque,
primarily using evergreen plantings of at least six feet in height and three
feet in depth at time of planting and shall be maintained by the property
owner.  If fencing is incorporated in any parking lot, it shall comply with
other rules in this chapter and any other Borough regulations relating to
fencing.  Buffer screens shall not be required in parking areas if the Borough
deems existing planting, topography, or man-made structures remaining on the
property acceptable for screening purposes.
   (c)   Service facilities shall be adequate and unobtrusive.  Buffer screens
shall be required and be such as to minimize noise and visual impact on the
surrounding area, and at a minimum be opaque, primarily using evergreen
plantings of at least six feet in height and three feet in depth at time of
planting.
   (d)   All mechanical equipment not enclosed in a structure shall be fully
and completely screened from view in a manner compatible with the architectural
and landscaping style of the remainder of the lot.
   (e)   Water towers, storage tanks, processing equipment, stand fans,
skylights, cooling towers, vents and any other structures or equipment which
rise above the roof line shall be architecturally compatible or effectively
shielded from view from any public or private street and from surrounding
residences by an architecturally sound method which shall be approved by the
Borough before construction or erection of said structures or equipment.
(Ord. 1044.  Passed 8-8-11.)
1293.06   STREET TREE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   All subdivisions and land developments shall provide street trees

five feet of street frontage, provided that lots with less than twenty- five
feet of frontage shall have at least one street tree.
         C.   Planting design shall accentuate views and integrate important
landscape elements.
   (d)   Street trees shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Minimum size – Two to two and one-half inches caliper.
      (2)   Branching height – The height of branching shall bear a
relationship to the size and species of tree; those trees selected for street
tree usage shall have a minimum clearance height of seven feet above grade
before branching begins.
      (3)   All trees to be installed shall be balled and burlapped or in
nursery cages/baskets in accordance with American Association of Nurserymen
Standards.  Those in nursery cages/baskets should have the cage/basket
completely removed at the time of planting.  The ball depth shall be not less
than sixty percent of the ball diameter and in all cases contain the maximum of
the fibrous roots of the tree.  Bare root material is not acceptable.  Minimum
ball diameter shall be twenty-four inches for two to two and one-half inches of
caliper and shall comply with American Association of Nurserymen Standards for
all trees of greater caliper.

that will be created as a result of development, one tree of at least two
inches to two and one-half inches caliper shall be planted.
   (b)   In the event that the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the
Borough that constraints incident to the land itself (including, but without
limitation, extreme topography, unsuitable soils, rock outcrops and existing
uninterrupted dense canopy) render it impracticable to locate on the lot the
required number of replacement plantings or street trees, then, at the election
of the Borough and where approved by the Borough as a condition of any
applicable subdivision or land development approval, the applicant shall
undertake one or a combination of the following:
      (1)   Install fewer, larger or more valuable trees with an aggregate cost
as installed and guaranteed not less than the estimated aggregate cost of the
required number of plantings.
      (2)   Install required replacement plantings at a site or sites other
than that subject to replacement planting.
      (3)   In lieu of actual installation of replacement plantings, place the
equivalent cash value, as agreed upon by the Borough and the applicant, for
required replacement plantings into a Borough fund established for that
purpose.  Such fund shall be utilized at the discretion of the Borough for the
management and maintenance of public street trees and/or public park areas
within the Borough.
   (c)   Required replacement vegetation and their measurement shall conform to
the standards of the publication "American or U.S.A. Standard for Nursery

geology, hydrology, soils and microclimate, shall promote the design objectives
of the plantings including visual screening, noise abatement and energy
conservation, and shall utilize as much as possible native plant material.
   (e)   The locations, selected species, and sizes of all replacement
plantings, along with a planting schedule tied to the timing and/or phasing of
the construction, shall be indicated on the final subdivision/land development
landscape plan or building permit application, as applicable, and shall be
subject to approval by the Borough.
   (f)   Vegetation intended to remain post-disturbance shall be protected from
damage during construction, including, but not limited to, damage to above-
ground vegetation structure, damage to root structure, and pollution of soil
impacting the vegetation.
   (g)   Where any tree greater than twelve inches caliper is removed without
prior Borough approval, replacement plantings in addition to any otherwise
required shall be installed in a manner acceptable to the Borough at a rate of
ten trees of at least three and one-half inch caliper for each tree so
removed.  Any other applicable penalty under law also shall be imposed.

entered into shall be recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds within 30 days
of their execution and a copy of the recorded lease shall be filed with the
Borough.
      (6)   At the time ownership of the open space is to be transferred from
the applicant, the natural and/or developed characteristics of that open space
shall be as stipulated under the terms of the approved plan. No construction
waste shall be buried or otherwise disposed of within the open space. Whenever
the required open space will not be dedicated in fee simple to the
municipality, a conservation easement perpetually restricting the property's
open space use shall be granted to the municipality. No transfer shall occur
until the receiving party is satisfied that such terms have been met.
(Ord. 961, § 802. Passed 8-13-01.)
1294.03  MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF COMMON OPEN SPACE AND FACILITIES.
   (a)   The applicant for any development proposed to contain common open
space and/or facilities shall, where applicable, provide to the Borough, at the
time of preliminary plan submission, a plan for maintenance and operation of
such open space and/or facilities. The plan shall:
      (1)   Define ownership;
      (2)   Establish necessary regular and periodic maintenance
responsibilities; and
      (3)   Estimate staffing needs, insurance requirements, and associated
costs, and define the means for funding same on an ongoing basis.
   (b)   In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common facilities, or any successor organization, shall, at any time after
establishment of the common facilities or the use attendant thereto, fail to
maintain all or any portion of the aforesaid in reasonable order and condition
in accordance with the development plan and all applicable laws, rules and
regulations, the Borough may serve written notice upon such organization or
upon the residents and owners of the uses relating thereto, setting forth the
manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the aforesaid common
facilities in reasonable condition, and such notice shall include a demand that
such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 30 days thereof, and shall
state the date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within 14
days of the notice. At such hearing the Borough may modify the terms of the
original notice as to the deficiencies, and may give an extension of time
within which the deficiencies shall be corrected. If the deficiencies set forth
in the original notice or in the modifications thereof are not corrected within
the 30 days or any extension thereof, the Borough, in order to preserve the
taxable values of the premises and to prevent the common facilities from
becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon the same and maintain the same for a
period of one year. Said entry and maintenance shall not constitute a taking of
the common facilities and shall not vest in the public any rights to use the
common facilities, except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public
by the residents and owners, and such dedication is acceptable to Borough
Council. Before the expiration of the year, the Borough shall, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for
the maintenance of the common facilities, call a public hearing upon notice to
the organization, or to the residents and owners of the dwelling units
attendant thereto, at which hearing such organization or the residents and
owners of the aforesaid dwelling units shall show cause why such maintenance by
the Borough shall not, at the election of Borough Council, continue for a
succeeding year. If Borough Council shall determine that such organization is
ready and able to maintain the common facilities, the Borough shall cease to
maintain the common facilities at the end of the year. If the aforesaid are not
ready and able to maintain the common facilities in a reasonable condition, the
Borough may, at the discretion of Borough Council, continue to maintain the
common facilities during the next succeeding year and subject to a similar
hearing and determination in such year thereafter. The decision of Borough
Council in any such case shall constitute a final administrative decision
subject to judicial review.
   (c)   The cost of such maintenance and enforcement proceedings by the
Borough shall be assessed ratably, in accordance with the tax assessments,
against the properties that have the right of enjoyment of the common
facilities and shall become a lien on the properties. The Borough, at the time
of entering upon such common facilities for the purpose of maintenance, shall
file a notice of such lien in the office of the County Prothonotary, upon the
properties affected by such lien.

1296.01  RELIEF FROM UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP.
   (a)   Borough Council may grant a modification of the requirements of one or
more provisions of this Subdivision and Land Development Code if the literal

have been paid.
   (b)   A subdivision or land development application fee (non-refundable) and
an escrow deposit shall be submitted with any application for preliminary or
final plan approval to cover the costs of plan review and processing. Amounts
of the application fee and escrow deposit shall be fixed through adoption of a
resolution by Borough Council. The escrowed funds shall be used to reimburse
the Borough for actual expenditures incident to these processes, including but
not limited to fees of the Borough Engineer and legal fees in excess of the fee
for review of the Borough's standard forms. Any costs incurred by the Borough
in excess of the amount held in escrow shall be fully reimbursed by the
applicant prior to the issuance of any permits. Any unexpended balance in the
escrow deposit shall become part of the second deposit required in division (c)
of this section.
   (c)   As a condition of final plan approval and recording and following the
establishment of any required performance guarantee, a second escrow deposit
shall be established to cover the cost of inspections of improvements
construction; materials or site testing; or maintenance costs (e.g., snow
removal), prior to the acceptance of improvements by the Borough. Any costs
incurred by the Borough in excess of the amount held in escrow shall be fully
reimbursed by the applicant. Any unexpended balance in the escrow deposit
following acceptance of dedication of improvements by the Borough shall be
returned to the applicant. The amount of the escrow deposit shall be fixed by
resolution of Borough Council.
(Ord. 961, § 903. Passed 8-13-01.)
1296.04  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   In addition to other remedies, Borough Council may institute and
maintain appropriate actions at law or in equity to restrain, correct, or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages, and to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure, or premises.
   (b)   The Borough may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property that has been
developed or that has resulted from a subdivision of real property in violation
of this Subdivision and Land Development Code. This authority to deny such a
permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
      (1)   The owner of record at the time of such violation.
      (2)   The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation, without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation.
      (3)   The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to
the time of violation without regard as to whether such current owner had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
      (4)   The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether
such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
   (c)   As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of
an approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee, or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the Borough may require compliance with
the conditions that would have been applicable to the property at the time the
applicant acquired an interest in such real property.
(Ord. 961, § 904. Passed 8-13-01.)

provision of this Subdivision and Land Development Code shall, upon being found
liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Borough, pay
a judgment in the amount of the maximum permitted under provisions of the MPC,
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
Borough as a result therefor. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied,
or be payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
district justice or other judicial authority. If the defendant neither pays nor
timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce the judgment pursuant to
the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues
shall constitute a separate violation, unless the district justice determining
that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good faith
basis for the individual, partnership, or corporation violating this Code to
have believed that there was no violation, in which event there shall be deemed
to have been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of
the determination of a violation by the district justice, and thereafter each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.

   The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate compliance with the Fair
Housing Amendments Act. Under this chapter, persons covered by the Fair Housing
Amendments Act, or those acting on behalf of such persons, may choose a
procedure, called a “Fair Housing Accommodation,” to request a reasonable
accommodation to applicable Borough codes. When such a reasonable accommodation
is requested this procedure is intended to be used in lieu of the usual Borough
permit and license procedures.
(Ord. 935.  Passed 4-12-99.)
1298.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply,
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   “Abutting property owner.”  The owner of record of a parcel of land
which is contiguous at any point to the parcel in question or is separated from
a contiguous point by right-of-way, alley, or easement.
   (b)   “Act.”  The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (42 USC 3601
et seq.)
   (c)   “Board.”  The Accommodation Request Review Board.
   (d)   “Code.” All ordinances and codes of the Borough of Swarthmore.
   (e)   “Reasonable accommodations.”  “Reasonable accommodation” within the
meaning of the Fair Housing Amendments Act.
   (f)   “Usual procedures.”  Any procedure normally used to secure a license
or permit issued by the Borough pursuant to any provision of the Code or a
regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, including any procedure normally used
to receive a variance from said Code or regulation.
(Ord. 935.  Passed 4-12-99.)
1298.03  INFORMATION TO BE MADE AVAILABLE.
   (a)   At any locations at which application is made for any Borough permit
or license, signs shall be posted advising applicants that information is
available concerning their rights under the Act. An “Information Statement”
shall be made available at such locations to advise applicants about the
process to be followed to request an accommodation under the Act.
   (b)   Any license or permit application forms used by the Borough shall
contain information advising applicants of the availability of information
about the Act.
(Ord. 935.  Passed 4-12-99.)
1298.04  REQUESTING A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.
   (a)   An applicant may elect to request a reasonable accommodation under the
Act pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter in lieu of any usual
procedures that would otherwise be available. However, the applicant may not
proceed with an accommodation request and the usual procedures at the same
time.
   (b)   If an applicant applies for more than one permit, the applicant may
choose separately with respect to each such permit whether to apply under
procedures set forth in this chapter or to follow the usual procedures.
   (c)   A decision will be made separately on each such permit application, so
that the grant of one application does not mean that all other applications
will necessarily be granted.
   (d)   An applicant requesting a reasonable accommodation under the Act must
file an accommodation request form with the Borough Manager and fully provide
all applicable requested information and documents. Once such a form is filed,
the procedures outlined in this chapter will be followed until the requested
accommodation is granted or denied, and any appeals have been exhausted, or
until the request is withdrawn pursuant to this chapter. If the requested
accommodation is finally denied, a person may then seek to obtain the license
or permit pursuant to the usual procedures.
   (e)   The applicant may withdraw a request for accommodation by filing with
the Borough Manager a notice to withdraw accommodation request. The processing
of an accommodation request form shall be discontinued upon receipt of a notice
to withdraw. The applicant may then choose to seek the license or permit under
the usual procedures.
   (f)   If an applicant has applied for a license or permit under the usual
procedures, the applicant may, at any time while such application is pending or
after an unfavorable decision has been rendered, choose to request a reasonable
accommodation under the procedures set forth in this chapter. To so choose, an
applicant must file an accommodation
request form as set forth in this chapter, and upon such filing the applicant's
request for a license or permit under the usual procedures will be deemed
withdrawn, and the procedures set forth in this chapter will be followed.

with all applicable licensing requirements. The Board may request further
information from the applicant as to whether the applicant is entitled to the
benefit of the Act and, if so, whether the requested accommodation is
reasonable.
   (c)   The applicant shall be responsible for notifying all abutting property
owners of the proposed request for reasonable accommodation and the date that
the request will be heard by the Board. Proof of proper notification, on a form
supplied by the Borough, shall be required as a precondition before any formal
action is taken on the application. Such form must be turned in to the Borough
Administrative Office at least ten working days before the scheduled meeting of
the Board.
   (d)   The Borough shall provide written notice of the hearing before the
Board at which the application will be discussed, to be conspicuously posted on
the affected tract of land at least one week prior to the hearing.
   (e)   The Board shall make a written decision within 60 days of the date the
Borough receives the accommodation request form, or the date the Board receives
all further information it has requested, whichever date is later. Such
decision shall address whether the requested accommodation is granted, denied,
or granted subject to conditions; how long a granted accommodation will remain
effective; whether the request is granted with respect to the applicant or with
respect to the property; and any other matters the Board deems relevant.
   (f)   Any license or permit granted under the reasonable accommodation
procedure shall bear the legend “Issued as a Reasonable Accommodation Pursuant
to the Fair Housing Act, Subject to the Following Conditions and Limitations”,
with all conditions and limitations, if any, listed.
   (g)   All reasonable accommodations that would otherwise have required a
variance shall cease upon a change in ownership or if the individual(s) with
respect to whom the reasonable accommodation was granted is (are) no longer
resident on the property.
   (h)   The applicant must notify the Borough promptly upon a change in
occupancy of the property, or if the individual(s) with respect to whom the

property.
(Ord. 935.  Passed 4-12-99.)

   To the extent the following do not conflict with the Act, the Board shall
take into consideration the following criteria, if applicable, in rendering its
decision:
   (a)   Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to afford a person
“handicapped” within the meaning of the Act equal opportunity to use and enjoy
a dwelling.
   (b)   Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or
administrative hardship upon the Borough.
   (c)   Whether the requested accommodation would undermine the purpose of
this chapter or procedure with regard to which the applicant is requesting an
accommodation.
   (d)   Whether the requested accommodation would be compatible and/or in
character with other uses in the particular zoning district.
   (e)   Whether the requested accommodation would adversely affect traffic
and/or parking issues.
   (f)   Whether the requested accommodation would adversely affect the health
and/or safety of the occupants or the public.
   (g)   Whether the requested accommodation would adversely affect property
values in a manner unrelated to the presence of persons qualifying as
“handicapped” under the FHAA.
   (h)   Whether the applicant has complied with any applicable licensure or
other governmental requirements in connection with the ownership, leasing,
construction, or operation regarding which the accommodation is sought.
   (i)   Whether the requested accommodation would undermine the zoning and
land use component of the Borough's comprehensive plan.

the Building Code that implicates a safety concern, the applicant has
adequately explained how it intends to satisfy the safety concern underlying
the provision to which the applicant seeks an accommodation.

1457.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry.  Therefore, the Borough Council of the Borough of Swarthmore does
hereby ordain that Chapter 1457 of the Code of the Borough of Swarthmore,
entitled "FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT," shall be and hereby is amended by deleting
the existing text thereof in its entirety and replacing it with the following.
(Ord. 1071.  Passed 6-8-15.)
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1457.02  INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to:
   (a)   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
   (b)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
   (c)   Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
   (d)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas subject
to flooding.
   (e)   Comply with Federal and State floodplain management requirements.
(Ord. 1071.  Passed 6-8-15.)
1457.03  APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or
development in any floodplain area within the Borough of Swarthmore unless a
permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
   (b)   A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings
or structures.
(Ord. 1071.  Passed 6-8-15.)
1457.04  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas.  However, any other ordinance provisions
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive.  If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 1071.  Passed 6-8-15.)
1457.05  SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter, which shall remain in
full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 1071.  Passed 6-8-15.)
1457.06  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (a)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study.  Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris.  This chapter does not imply that areas
outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land uses permitted within
such areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
   (b)   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Swarthmore or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
(Ord. 1071.  Passed 6-8-15.)
ADMINISTRATION
1457.07  DESIGNATION OF FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   The Borough Manager is hereby appointed to administer and enforce this

to qualified technical personnel, plan examiners, inspectors, and other
employees; or
      (3)   Enter into a written agreement or written contract with another

   A permit shall be required before any construction or development is
undertaken within any floodplain area of the Borough of Swarthmore.
(Ord. 1071.  Passed 6-8-15.)
1457.09  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit only after it has
been determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance
with the requirements of this and all other applicable codes and ordinances.
   (b)   Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator
shall review the application for the permit to determine if all other necessary
government permits required by State and Federal laws have been obtained, such
as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (Act 1966-537, as
amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as
amended); the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended); and

issued until this determination has been made.
   (c)   In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any
permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall review the history of repairs to the
subject building, so that any repetitive loss/cumulative substantial damage
issues can be addressed before the permit is issued.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall consider cumulative substantial
damage when determining whether compliance to the provisions related to
substantially damaged structures.  The Borough shall track the damage/cost to
repair amounts over a period of time (usually ten years), determine when the
threshold for substantial damage is met and require a permit for repair for
compliance to the full extent of the floodplain ordinance after the most recent
damage occurred.
   (e)   During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or other
authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine that the work is
progressing in compliance with the information provided on the permit
application and with all applicable municipal laws and ordinances.  He/she
shall make as many inspections during and upon completion of the work as are
necessary.
   (f)   In the discharge of his/her duties, the Floodplain Administrator shall
have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or development in
the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of proper credentials, at any
reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
   (g)   In the event the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does
not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and ordinances,
or that there has been a false statement or misrepresentation by any applicant,
the Floodplain Administrator shall revoke the permit and report such fact to
the Borough Council for whatever action it considers necessary.
   (h)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain all records associated
with the requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to, finished
construction elevation data, permitting, inspection and enforcement.
   (i)   The Floodplain Administrator is the official responsible for
submitting a biennial report to the FEMA concerning community participation in
the National Flood Insurance Program and Pennsylvania ACT 166, the Pennsylvania
Flood Plain Management Act.
   (j)   The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments
of the Floodplain Administrator can be delegated from the person identified. 
However, the ultimate responsibility lies with the person identified in the
floodplain ordinance as the floodplain administrator/manager.
   (k)   The Floodplain Administrator shall consider the requirements of the 34
PA Code and the 2009 IBC and the 2009 IRC or latest revisions thereof.

1457.19  DESCRIPTION AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF IDENTIFIED FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
   The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
   (a)   The floodway area/district identified as floodway in the FIS which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must
be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any point. This
term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special flood hazard
areas where no floodway has been identified in the FIS.
      (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office and is consistent with the Borough's Act 167 Stormwater Management

   (ee)   "Special permit" means a special approval which is required for
hospitals, nursing homes, jails, and new manufactured home parks and
subdivisions and substantial improvements to such existing parks, when such
development is located in all, or a designated portion of a floodplain.
   (ff)   "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other
proposed new development and means the date the permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days after the date of the
permit and shall be completed within twelve months after the date of issuance
of the permit unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator.  The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. 
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds

to heirs, or devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development. 
Provided, however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural
purposes into parcels of more than ten acres, not involving any new street or
easement of access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
   (ii)   "Substantial damage" means damage from any cause sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent or more of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   "Substantial improvement."
      (1)   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement
of a structure, of which the cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market
value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. 
This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" (or
"repetitive loss" when a repetitive loss provision is used) regardless of the
actual repair work performed.  The term does not, however, include any project
for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions.
      (2)   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this chapter, must comply
with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
   (kk)   "Uniform Construction Code (UCC)" is the statewide building code
adopted by The Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities whether administered by the municipality, a
third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to residential
and commercial buildings, The Code adopted The International Residential Code
(IRC) and the International Building Code (IBC), by reference, as the
construction standard applicable with the State floodplain construction.  For
coordination purposes, references to the above are made specifically to various
sections of the IRC and the IBC.
   (ll)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR 60.3(b)(5),
(c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

I.  GENERAL PROVISIONS
1459.001  SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Borough of Swarthmore Watershed
Stormwater Management Ordinance.
(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.002  STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   The governing body of the Borough of Swarthmore finds that:
   (a)   Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from
development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities,
contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of
existing streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
infiltration, and threatens public health and safety.
   (b)   Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from
land development throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources
by changing the natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which
increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks, thereby elevating
sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, and
pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss of recharge.
   (c)   A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
minimization of impacts of development, redevelopment, and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the
public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the Borough
and all of the people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the
environment.
   (d)   Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
infiltration for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also protects
and maintains surface water quality.
   (e)   Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water
quality, infiltration, stream baseflow, and aquatic ecosystems. The most cost-
effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is
through nonstructural project design that minimizes impervious surfaces and
sprawl, avoids sensitive areas (i.e., stream buffers, floodplains, steep
slopes), and considers topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic
regime.
   (f)   Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
   (g)   Federal and State regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required
to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
   (h)   Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the Commonwealth by the Borough.
(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.003  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within the Borough by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and
minimizing the impacts described in Section
1459.002 through provisions designed to:
   (a)   Promote alternative project designs and layouts that minimize the
impacts on surface and groundwater.
   (b)   Promote nonstructural best management practices (BMPs).
   (c)   Minimize increases in runoff stormwater volume.
   (d)   Minimize impervious surfaces.
   (e)   Manage accelerated stormwater runoff and erosion and sedimentation
problems and stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating activities
that cause these problems.
   (f)   Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
   (g)   Utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
   (h)   Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, requiring a
minimum of structures and relying on natural processes.
   (i)   Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain base flow, to prevent
degradation of surface and groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water
resources.
   (j)   Protect base flows and quality of streams and watercourses, where
possible.
   (k)   Meet legal water quality requirements under State law, including
regulations at 25 Pennsylvania Code Chapter 93.4.a requiring protection and
maintenance of "existing uses" and maintenance of the level of water quality to
support those uses in all streams, and the protection and maintenance of water
quality in "special protection" streams.
   (l)   Address the quality and quantity of stormwater discharges from the
development site.
   (m)   Provide standards to meet certain NPDES MS4 permit requirements.
   (n)   Implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program that
addresses non-stormwater discharges into the Borough's separate storm sewer
system (MS4).
   (o)   Preserve the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
   (p)   Prevent accelerated scour, erosion and sedimentation of stream
channels.
   (q)   Provide performance standards and design criteria based on watershed-
wide stormwater management planning.
   (r)   Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management facilities and BMPs that are implemented within the Borough.
(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.004  STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The Borough is empowered or required to regulate land use activities that
affect runoff and surface and groundwater quality and quantity by the authority
of:
   (a)   Act of October 4, 1978, 32 P.S., P.L. 864 (Act 167) Section 680.1 et
seq., as amended, the "Storm Water Management Act" (hereinafter referred to as
"the Act");
   (b)   Borough Code, 53 P.S. Section 46201 et seq.;
   (c)   Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, Act 247, as amended.
(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.005  APPLICABILITY/REGULATED ACTIVITIES.
   (a)   All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater
runoff, including but not limited to land development, redevelopment, and earth
disturbance activity located within the Borough, are subject to all regulations
contained in this chapter.
   (b)   Additionally, all properties within the Borough, at all times, are
subject to the provisions of Article VII (Prohibitions) of this chapter.
   (c)   This chapter contains the stormwater management performance standards
and design criteria that are necessary from a watershed-wide perspective. Local
stormwater management design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type,
collection system design and details, outlet structure design, etc.) shall
continue to be regulated by the applicable Borough ordinances and applicable
State regulations.
(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.006  EXEMPTIONS.
   An exemption shall not relieve the applicant from implementing the
requirements of this chapter or from implementing such measures as are
necessary to protect public health, safety, and property.  An exemption shall
not relieve the applicant from complying with the special requirements for
watersheds draining to identified high quality (HQ) or exceptional value (EV)
waters or any other current or future State or municipal water quality
protection requirements.  If a drainage problem is documented or known to exist
downstream of, or is expected from the proposed activity, then the Borough may
withdraw exemptions listed in Table 106 and require the applicant to comply
with all requirements of this chapter.  Even though exempt, the applicant is
not relieved from complying with other Borough ordinances or regulations.
   (a)   General Exemptions.
      (1)   Table 106.1 summarizes the exemptions from certain provisions of
this chapter.  Exemptions are for the items noted in Table 106.1 only, and
shall not relieve the applicant from other applicable sections of this chapter.
      (2)   Any regulated activity that is exempt from some provisions of the
chapter is exempt only from those provisions.  If development is to take place
in phases, the developer is responsible for implementing the requirements of
the chapter as the impervious cover/earth disturbance threshold is met.  The
date of the chapter adoption shall be the starting point from which to consider
tracts as "parent tracts" in which future subdivisions and respective
impervious area and earth disturbance computations shall be cumulatively
considered.  Exemption shall not relieve the applicant from implementing such
measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, and property. For example:
 
If a property owner proposes a 150 square foot shed after adoption of the
municipal stormwater management chapter that property owner would be exempted
from water quality and quantity requirements of the chapter as noted in Table
106.1 of the chapter. If, at a later date, the property owner proposes to
construct a 499 square foot room addition, the applicant would be required to
comply with the requirements for the Simplified Method for the full 649 square
feet of impervious cover created since adoption of the Borough ordinance. If an
additional 700 square foot swimming pool/patio is proposed later, the property
owner would be required to implement the full stormwater quantity and quality
control submission requirements of this chapter for the total 1,349 square feet
of additional impervious surface added to the original property since adoption
of the Borough ordinance.

an integrated pest management (IPM) plan).
      (3)   While streets and highways (average daily traffic volume (ADT)
greater than 30,000) are not considered stormwater hotspots, it is important to
ensure that highway stormwater management facilities are designed to adequately
protect receiving streams and/or groundwater.
      (4)   The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) NPDES stormwater
program requires some industrial sites to prepare and implement a stormwater
pollution prevention plan.
   (u)   For any location where a new concentrated discharge of stormwater from
any frequency rainfall event, up to and including the 100-year, 24-hour event,
will flow onto a downgradient property, the following are required:

development of other stormwater management site plan design elements:
         A.   Prepare an existing resource and site analysis map (ERSAM)
showing environmentally sensitive areas including, but not limited to, steep

(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.019  INFILTRATION VOLUME REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   (1)   Providing for infiltration consistent with the natural
hydrologic regime is required. Design of the infiltration facilities shall
consider infiltration to compensate for the reduction in the recharge that
occurs when the ground surface is disturbed or impervious surface is created.
      (2)   If it cannot be physically accomplished, then the design
professional shall be responsible for demonstrating to the satisfaction of the
Borough that this cannot be physically accomplished on the site (e.g., shallow
depth to bedrock or limiting zone, open voids, steep slopes, etc. vs. a
financial hardship as defined in Section
1459.008). If it can be physically accomplished, the volume of runoff to be
infiltrated shall be determined from paragraph (b)(2) hereof depending on
demonstrated site conditions, and shall be the greatest volume that can be
physically infiltrated. For example:
         1.   Any applicant (developer or redeveloper) shall first attempt to
infiltrate the volume required in paragraph (b)(2)A. hereof.
         2.   If the paragraph (b)(2)A. hereof requirement cannot be physically
accomplished, then the applicant is required to attempt to infiltrate the
volume required in paragraph (b)(2)B. hereof.
         3.   Finally, if the paragraph (b)(2)B. hereof, infiltration volume
cannot be physically accomplished, the applicant must, at a minimum, infiltrate
the volume required in paragraph (b)(2)C. hereof.
   (b)   Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
      (1)   Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed or
redeveloped areas shall be selected based on suitability of soils and site
conditions and shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
         A.   A minimum depth of twenty-four inches between the bottom of the
BMP and the top of the limiting zone.
         B.   An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional
stormwater volume and dewater completely as determined by field tests conducted
by the applicant's design professional.
         C.   The infiltration facility shall be capable of completely draining
the retention (infiltration) volume (Rev) within three days (seventy-two hours)
from the end of the design storm.
      (2)   The size of the infiltration facility and Rev shall be based upon
the following volume criteria:
         A.   Modified Control Guideline One (MCG-1) of the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices (PA BMP) Manual – The retention
(infiltration) volume (Rev) to be captured and infiltrated shall be the net
two-year twenty-four-hour volume.  The net volume is the difference between the
post-development runoff volume and the pre-development runoff volume. The post-
development total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the two-
year twenty- four-hour duration precipitation shall not be increased. For
modeling purposes, existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must
be considered meadow in good condition or its equivalent, and twenty percent of
existing impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow in good
condition.
         B.   Infiltrating the entire Rev volume in paragraph (b)(2)A. (above)
may not be feasible on every site due to site-specific limitations such as
shallow depth to bedrock or the water table.  If it cannot be physically
accomplished, then the following criteria from Modified Control Guideline Two
(MCG-2) of the PA BMP Manual must be satisfied:
         At least the first one-inch of runoff from new or replacement
impervious surfaces shall be infiltrated.
 
   Rev = 1 (inch) * impervious area (square feet) ÷ 12 (inches) = cubic feet (cf)
 
   An asterisk (*) in equations denotes multiplication.
 
         C.   Only if infiltrating the entire Rev volume in paragraph (b)(2)B.
(above) cannot be physically accomplished, then the following minimum criteria
from Modified Control Guideline Two (MCG-2) of the PA BMP Manual must be
satisfied:
            1.   Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed
to accommodate infiltration of the entire water quality volume (WQV) (Section
1459.020(b)); however, in all cases at least the first one-half inch of the WQV
shall be infiltrated. The minimum infiltration volume (Rev) required would,
therefore, be computed as:
 
   Rev = I * impervious area (square feet) ÷ 12 (inches) = cubic feet (cf)
 
   An asterisk (*) in equations denotes multiplication.
Where:
 
I = The maximum equivalent infiltration amount (inches) that the site can
physically accept or 0.50 inch, whichever is greater.
 
            2.   The retention volume values derived from the methods in
paragraphs (b)(2)A., (b)(2)B., or (b)(2)C. hereof is the minimum volume the
applicant must control through an infiltration BMP facility.  If site
conditions preclude capture of runoff from portions of the impervious area, the
infiltration volume for the remaining area should be increased an equivalent
amount to offset the loss.
            3.   Only if the minimum of one-half inch of infiltration
requirement cannot be physically accomplished, a waiver from this section,
Infiltration Volume Requirements is required from the Borough.
   (c)   Soils.  A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be
required to determine the suitability of infiltration facilities.  The
evaluation shall be performed by a qualified design professional and at minimum
address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability.  The
general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
      (1)   Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made
features within the site to determine general areas of suitability for
infiltration practices. In areas where development on fill material is under
consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of sub-grade stability;
infiltration may not be ruled out without conducting these tests.
      (2)   Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or hydraulic
conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed infiltration surface) to
determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate. Percolation tests are
not recommended for design purposes.
      (3)   Design the infiltration structure for the required retention (Rev)
volume based on field determined capacity at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface.
      (4)   If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicant's
design professional, it must be demonstrated to the Borough that the soils are
conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
   (d)   Infiltration facilities should, to the greatest extent practicable, be
located to avoid introducing contaminants via groundwater, and be in
conformance with an approved source water protection assessment or source water
protection plan.
   (e)   Roadway drainage systems should provide an opportunity to capture
accidental spills. Road de-icing material storage facilities shall be designed
to avoid salt and chloride runoff from entering waterways and infiltration
facilities. The qualified design professional shall evaluate the possibility of
groundwater contamination from the proposed infiltration facility and perform a
hydrogeologic justification study if necessary.
   (f)   The antidegredation analysis found in Chapter 93 shall be applied in
HQ or EV streams.
   (g)   An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the
possibility of groundwater contamination exists. The Borough may require a
detailed hydrogeologic investigation.
   (h)   The applicant should provide safeguards against groundwater
contamination for land uses that may cause groundwater contamination should
there be a mishap or spill.
(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.020  WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   (1)   The applicant shall comply with the following water quality
requirements of this Article.
      (2)   To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated
activities and conform to State water quality requirements, BMPs which
replicate pre-development stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions must be
provided in the site design such that post-construction stormwater discharges
do not degrade the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of the
receiving waters. This may be achieved by the following:
         A.   Infiltration: replication of pre-construction stormwater
infiltration conditions;
         B.   Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to provide
filtering of chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff; and
         C.   Stream bank and stream bed protection: management of volume and
rate of post-construction stormwater discharges to prevent physical degradation
of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
   (b)   (1)   Developed areas shall provide adequate storage and treatment
facilities necessary to capture and treat stormwater runoff. The infiltration
volume computed under Section
1459.019 may be a component of the water quality volume if the applicant
chooses to manage both components in a single facility. If the calculated water
quality volume (WQV) is greater than the volume required to be infiltrated as
described in Section
1459.019(b)(2), then the difference between the two volumes shall be treated
for water quality by an acceptable stormwater management practice(s).  The
required water quality volume (WQV) is the storage capacity needed to capture
and treat a portion of stormwater runoff from the developed areas of the site.
      (2)   To achieve this requirement, the following criterion is
established:
         A.   From Control Guideline (CG-1) in the PA BMP Manual, the water
quality volume shall be the net two-year twenty-four-hour volume.  The net
volume is the difference between the post-development runoff volume and the
pre-development runoff volume. The post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour duration
precipitation shall not be increased.  For modeling purposes, existing (pre-
development) non-forested pervious areas must be considered meadow in good
condition or its equivalent, and twenty percent of existing impervious area,
when present, shall be considered meadow in good condition.
         B.   This volume requirement can be managed by the permanent volume of
a wet basin or the detained volume from other BMPs. Where appropriate, wet
basins shall be utilized for water quality control and shall follow the
guidelines of the PA BMP manual.
         C.   Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the
invert of the water quality orifice is at the invert of the facility).  The
design of the facility shall provide for protection from clogging and unwanted
sedimentation.
   (c)   The temperature of receiving waters shall be protected through the use
of BMPs that moderate temperature.
   (d)   If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through, or a waterbody
(i.e., lake, pond, and/or wetland) is present on the site, the applicant shall
create a riparian buffer extending a minimum of fifty feet to either side of
the top-of-bank of the channel, lake, or wetland.  The buffer area shall be
planted with native vegetation and maintained in a vegetated state (applicant
should reference the Pennsylvania Native Plant List contained in the
Pennsylvania BMP Manual).
      (1)   The following provisions also apply to riparian buffers on lots in
existence at the time of adoption of this chapter:
         A.   If the applicable rear or side yard setback is less than fifty
feet, the buffer width may be reduced to twenty-five percent of the setback or
twenty-five feet, whichever is greater.
         B.   If a stream traverses a site in a manner that significantly
reduces the use of the site, the buffer may be either:
            1.   Reduced to twenty-five feet on either side, with Borough
approval; or
            2.   Reduced to ten feet with Borough waiver.
      (2)   Permitted uses within the buffer include the following, subject to
Borough approval and provided that they comply with all Federal, State, and
local regulations:
         A.   Recreational trails, in compliance with Riparian Buffer Trail
Guidelines adopted by the Borough.
         B.   Utility rights-of-way.
         C.   Bridges.
         D.   Other uses subject to Borough approval.
   (e)   If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant,
easement, etc.) and it exceeds the requirements of this chapter, the existing
buffer shall be maintained.
(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.021  STREAM BANK EROSION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   In addition to controlling the water quality volume (in order to
minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream stream bank erosion),
the primary requirement to control stream bank erosion is to design a BMP to
detain the proposed conditions two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm to the
existing conditions one-year flow using the SCS Type II distribution.
Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as adding a small orifice at the
bottom of the outlet structure) to release the proposed conditions one-year
storm for a minimum of twenty-four hours from a point in time when the maximum
volume of water from the one-year storm is stored in a proposed BMP (i.e., the
maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water
can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water quality
orifice is at the invert of the facility).
   (b)   The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be
three inches in diameter where possible, and a trash rack shall be installed to
prevent clogging. On sites with small drainage areas contributing to this BMP
that do not provide enough runoff volume to allow a twenty-four-hour
attenuation with the three-inch orifice, the calculations shall be submitted
showing this condition. When the calculated orifice size is below three inches,
gravel filters (or other methods) are recommended to discharge low-flow rates
subject to the Borough Engineer's satisfaction.  When filters are utilized,
maintenance provisions shall be provided to ensure filters meet the design
function. All facilities shall make use of measures to extend the flow path and
increase the travel time of flows in the facility.
(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.022  STORMWATER PEAK RATE CONTROL.
   (a)   Each watershed has been divided into either stormwater management
districts or release rate districts as shown on the respective Management
District or Release Rate Maps in Appendix A.
      (1)   In addition to the watershed-specific requirements specified in
Tables 308.1, below, the erosion and sedimentation control (Section
1459.017), the nonstructural project design (Section
1459.018), the infiltration (Section
1459.019), the water quality (Section
1459.020), and the stream bank erosion (Section
1459.021) requirements shall be implemented.
      (2)   Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in a watershed for
the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year design storms are shown in Tables
308.1.  Development sites located in each of the management/release rate
districts must control proposed conditions runoff rates to existing conditions
runoff rates for the design storms in accordance with the Table.
   (b)   General.  Proposed conditions rates of runoff from any regulated
activity shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff from existing
conditions for the design storms specified on the Stormwater Management
District Watershed Map provided in Appendix A of this chapter.
   (c)   District Boundaries.  The boundaries of the stormwater management
districts are shown on an official map that is available for inspection at the
Borough and County Planning offices.  A copy of the official map at a reduced
scale is included in Appendix A of this chapter.  The exact location of the
stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development
site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot
topographic contours (or most accurate data required) provided as part of the
SWM site plan.
   (d)   Sites Located in More than One District or Watershed.  For a proposed
development site located within two or more stormwater management district
subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall meet the management
district criteria for which the discharge is located.  The natural hydrology of
each respective subarea shall be maintained, and drainage shall not be
redirected from one subarea to another.  Under circumstances where the
applicant shows this cannot be accomplished, a waiver is required by the
Borough.

   (e)   Off-site Areas.  Off-site areas that drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining
allowable peak runoff rates.  On-site drainage facilities shall be designed to
safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
   (f)   Site Areas.  Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only the
proposed impact area utilizing stormwater management measures shall be subject
to the peak rate control standards noted above.  Unimpacted areas for which the
discharge point has not changed are not subject to the peak rate control
standards.
   (g)   Hardship Option for Regulated Activities Less than One Acre.  There
may be certain instances where the peak rate criteria are too restrictive for a
particular landowner or applicant.  The existing drainage network in some areas
may be capable of safely transporting slight increases in flows without causing
a problem or increasing flows elsewhere.  This must be demonstrated as per
subsection (h) below in order for the hardship option to be considered.  If an
applicant or homeowner cannot meet the stormwater standards due to lot
conditions or if conformance would become a hardship to an owner, the hardship
option may be applied. Any landowners pleading the "hardship option" will
assume all liabilities that may arise due to exercising this option. Cost or
financial burden cannot be considered as a hardship. The applicant may consider
off-site management controls or contributing to the Municipal Stormwater
Control and BMP Operation and Maintenance Fund (Section
1459.072) as long as the stormwater management controls are within the same
subwatershed.
   (h)   "Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis".  Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this chapter shall use the
following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow
rates:
      (1)   Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the
increased runoff associated with a two-year storm event within their banks at
velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion.  Velocities
shall be based upon criteria and methodologies acceptable to the Borough.
      (2)   Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
increased twenty-five-year storm event runoff without creating any increased
hazard to persons or property.
      (3)   Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other hydraulic facilities
which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with PADEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and, at a
minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year storm event runoff.
      (4)   Water quality requirements defined in Section
1459.021 must be met.
      (5)   Post construction peak rates shall not exceed the existing peak
rates for the respective subarea.
   (i)   Alternate Criteria for Redevelopment Sites.  For redevelopment sites,
one of the following minimum design parameters shall be accomplished, whichever
is most appropriate for the given site conditions as determined by the Borough
of Swarthmore:
      (1)   Meet the full requirements specified by Table 308.1 and subsections
(a) through (h) hereof, or
      (2)   Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least twenty
percent; based upon a comparison of existing impervious surface to proposed
impervious surface.  In this case, calculations must be provided that show the
peak rate has not increased.
(Ord. 1051.  Passed 8-13-12.)
1459.023  CALCULATION METHODOLOGY.
   (a)   Stormwater runoff from all development sites with a drainage area of
greater than five acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted
calculation technique that is based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method. 
Table 309.1 summarizes acceptable computation methods.  The method selected by
the design professional shall be based on the individual limitations and
suitability of each method for a particular site. The use of the rational
method to estimate peak discharges for drainage areas greater than five acres
shall be permitted only upon approval of the Borough.

   (b)   All calculations consistent with this chapter using the Soil Cover
Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the various
return period storms.  Rainfall depths shall be according to NOAA Atlas 14
values consistent with a partial duration series. When stormwater calculations
are performed for routing procedures or water quality functions, the duration
of rainfall shall be twenty-four hours.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used for peak rate runoff
calculations:
      (1)   For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground
cover used in determining the existing conditions flow rates shall be as
follows:
         A.   Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of "woods in good
condition." Portions of a site having more than one viable tree measuring a
diameter at breast height (DBH) of six inches or greater per 1,500 square feet
shall be considered wooded where such trees existed within three years of
application.
         B.   The undeveloped portion of the site including agriculture, bare
earth, and fallow ground shall be considered as "meadow in good condition,"
unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve (CN) number or Rational
"c" value (i.e., woods) as listed in Tables B-1 or B-2 in Appendix B of this
chapter.
      (2)   For redevelopment sites, the ground cover used in determining the
existing conditions flow rates for the developed portion of the site shall be
based upon actual land cover conditions. 
   (d)   All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times-of-concentration (duration) and
storm events with rainfall intensities obtained from NOAA Atlas 14 partial
duration series estimates, or the latest version of the PennDOT Drainage Manual
(PDM Publication 584). Times-of-concentration shall be calculated based on the
methodology recommended in the respective model used.  Times of concentration
for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's equation.
   (e)   Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions to
be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be obtained from Table B-1 in
Appendix B of this chapter.
   (f)   Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for
use in the Rational Method shall be obtained from Table B-2 in Appendix B of
this chapter.

accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.
   (i)   The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the
performance standards of this chapter shall be verified by routing the design
storm hydrograph through these facilities using an acceptable method.  The
design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that
produces a full hydrograph.  The Borough may approve the use of any generally
accepted full hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces a full
hydrograph.

1480.04  INTERPRETATION; CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   This chapter supplements or supersedes any provisions currently in effect in
flood-prone areas.  However, an underlying ordinance shall remain in full force
and effect to the extent that its provisions are more restrictive.
(Ord. 784.  Passed 7-11-77.)
1480.05  NONLIABILITY OF BOROUGH.
   The degree of flood protection sought by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering
methods of study.  Larger floods may occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights
may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris.  This chapter does not imply that areas outside
of any identified flood-prone area, or that land uses permitted within such
areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage.
   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough, or on an
officer or employee thereof, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter or on any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

1480.28  VARIANCES.

chapter would result in exceptional hardship for a prospective builder,
developer or landowner, the Borough may, upon request, grant relief from the
strict application of such requirements.
   (b)   Requests for variances shall be considered by the Borough in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections
1480.18 and
1480.19 and the following procedures:
      (1)   No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use
or activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in the 100-
year flood elevation.
      (2)   If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.
      (3)   In granting any variance, the Borough may attach whatever
reasonable conditions and safeguards it considers necessary in order to protect
the public health, safety and walfare and to achieve the objectives of this
chapter.
      (4)   Whenever a variance is granted, the Borough shall notify the
applicant in writing that:
         A.   The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance.
         B.   Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
      (5)   In reviewing any request for a variance, the Borough shall
consider, but not be limited to, the following:
         A.   That there is good and sufficient cause;
         B.   That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   That the granting of the variance will not result in an
unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood heights, additional threats to
public safety or extraordinary public expense, and will not create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with any other
applicable local or State law or regulation.
      (6)   A complete record of all variance requests and related actions
shall be maintained by the Borough.  In addition, a report of all variances
granted during the year shall be included in the annual report to the Federal
Insurance Administration.
