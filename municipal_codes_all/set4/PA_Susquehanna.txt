and payable with the updated registration. The previous mortgagee will
not be released from the responsibility of paying all previous unpaid
fees, fines, and penalties accrued during that mortgagee's involvement
with the registrable property.

IDENTIFICATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS
§ 8-401. Identification.
§ 8-402. Description and Special Requirements of Identified
Floodplain Areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
1. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Susquehanna
Township, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated August 2, 2012, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Susquehanna Township and
declared to be a part of this Chapter.
A. The Floodway Area/District shall be those areas identified as floodway
on the FIRM as well as those floodway areas which have been identified
in other available studies or sources of information for those special
floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the Flood
Insurance Study. The floodway represents the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation by more than one foot at any point.
(1) Within the Floodway Area/District, no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection's Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District Without Floodway shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the Flood Insurance Study
prepared by FEMA and for which base flood elevations have been
provided in the Flood Insurance Study but no floodway has been
delineated.
§ 8-401 FOREWORD § 8-402
FWD:161
§ 8-403. Changes in Identification of Area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the
Susquehanna Township Board of Commissioners where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need
for such revision. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than
six months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
§ 8-404. Boundary Disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Susquehanna Township Planning
Commission, and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may
appeal to the Susquehanna Township Board of Commissioners. The burden
of proof shall be on the Appellant.
§ 8-405. Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
(1) In an AE Area/District Without Floodway, no new development shall
be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of all past and projected development will not increase the
base flood elevation by more than one foot.
(2) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use,
or activity within any AE Area/District Without Floodway unless it
is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development would not, together with all existing and anticipated
development, increase the base flood elevation more than one foot
at any point.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by FEMA and for
which no one-percent-annual-chance flood elevations have been
provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway information from
other Federal, State, or other acceptable source shall be used when
available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the
elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the
boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the
construction site. In lieu of the above, Susquehanna Township may
require the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by Susquehanna Township.
§ 8-402 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 8-405
FWD:162
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

in raw shells eggs, the growth of Salmonella Enteritidis. Potentially
hazardous food includes an animal food (a food of animal origin) that
is raw or heat-treated; a food of plant origin that is heat-treated or
consists of raw seed sprouts; cut melons; and garlic-in-oil mixtures that
are not modified in a way that results in mixtures that do not support
growth as specified in this definition. Potentially hazardous food does
not include: (i) an air-cooled hard-boiled egg with shell intact, or a
shell egg that is not hard-boiled, but has been treated to destroy all
viable Salmonellae; (ii) a food with an aw value of 0.85 or less; (iii) a
food with a pH level of 4.6 or below when measured at 24° C. (75°

food for which laboratory evidence demonstrates that the rapid and
progressive growth of infectious or toxigenic microorganism or the
growth S, Enteritidis in eggs or C. botulinum can not occur, such as a
food that has an aw and a pH that are above the levels specified herein
and that may contain a preservative, other barrier to the growth of
microorganisms, or a combination of barriers that inhibit the growth
of microorganisms; or (vi) a food that does not support the growth of
microorganisms as specified, in this definition, even though the food
may contain an infectious or toxigenic microorganism or chemical or
physical contaminant at a level sufficient to cause illness.
Section 210.2. Prohibition of potentially hazardous food. No public
food merchandising establishment within the Township of
Susquehanna may sell for consumption, on or off the premises, any

(A) General. Approved grease traps must be installed to treat
wastewater emanating from any food establishment. Such
establishments include, but are not limited to: motels, cafeterias,
restaurants, hospitals, schools and other institutions.
Wastewater from garbage grinders should not be discharged to
grease traps.
(B) Grease trap design and location requirements.
§ 10-202 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 10-202
FWD:204
(1) New food establishments or existing food establishments
without grease traps: Except as indicated below, the grease
trap shall be placed outside the food establishment, receive
only wastewater from food service related activities (i.e., no
sanitary sewage), and shall discharge into the sewer system.
Grease traps shall be located within 20 to 30 feet from the
plumbing fixtures served to prevent congealing and clogging
of waste lines. The minimum size of grease traps permitted
is 1,000 gallons. Other design considerations include: (i) the
inlet and outlet on the grease trap shall be properly baffled
(double compartment); (ii) manhole is to be finished to grade
to allow for easy access for proper maintenance; and (iii)
inaccessibility of the trap to insects and vermin.
Except as otherwise provided, grease interceptors shall be
located outside the rear of food establishments and in nontraffic
areas for all installations. Where an interceptor must
be located in an area used by vehicles, it shall have a cover
designed for heavy traffic applications. Each unit shall be
serviceable on grade with the cover completely removable.
The cover shall be surrounded by a housekeeping pad of
concrete construction. In addition, where required by the
manufacturer, the unit shall be placed in an insulated pit
designed to manufacturer's specifications. The interceptor
shall be accessible at all times to the Township Plumbing
Inspector and Township Sewer Authority personnel. Each
proposed interceptor design shall be approved by the
Township Sewer Authority prior to installation.
Interceptors may be installed inside existing food
establishments in those cases where outside space is
insufficient for the unit installation. Inside grease
interceptors shall be approved by the Township Sewer
Authority prior to installation.
§ 10-202 FOREWORD § 10-202
FWD:205
(2) Existing food establishments with grease traps. Existing food
establishments with grease traps shall submit an application
for continued operation of their existing grease traps and
shall be permitted to maintain existing grease traps that do
not meet the new food establishment criteria. If the food
establishment discharges excessive grease as determined by
either evidence of grease fouling in the Authority sewers
positively attributed to the food establishment or sampling
of the food establishment discharge to the sewer system
with grease and oil concentrations in excess of the limits
established by the Susquehanna Township Sewer Use
Ordinance (currently 100 ppm), the existing food
establishment will be required to file a plan, acceptable
to the Township Sewer Authority, indicating the steps that
will be taken to assure that excessive grease will not be
discharged in the future. If the existing food establishment
does not, or cannot, file such a plan, or if the food
establishment is found to discharge excessive grease after
such an acceptable plan is filed, said existing food
establishment shall, within two years of notification, be
required to install grease trap facilities meeting the
specifications for new food establishments as set forth in this
subsection (2).
§ 10-202 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 10-202
FWD:206
(3) Maintenance. In the maintaining of these traps, the permit
holder shall be responsible for proper removal and disposal,
by appropriate means, of the captured material. The permit
holder shall maintain records of the dates and means of
disposal, which are subject to review by the Authority.
Currently licensed waste disposal firms must perform any
removal and hauling of the collected materials. Grease traps
meeting the "new food establishment" design criteria shall
be cleaned at least bimonthly, or as otherwise required by
the Township Health Officer or other designated officer of
the Township, and reports submitted to the Township Health
Officer or other designated officer of the Township. For all
other facilities, the Township Health Officer or other
designated officer of the Township shall initially require a
written report indicating biweekly grease draw-off quantities
over a three-month time period. Such report shall be
submitted in letter form and shall clearly indicate the permit
holder's name and address, the location of the food
establishment as well as the information requested. The
Township Health Officer or other designated officer of the
Township shall review the submitted report and shall make
the determination as to the frequency of interceptor grease
draw-off to be scheduled. This schedule of grease draw-off
shall be strictly followed on a continual basis until such time
as the grease-laden discharge or drainage is discontinued,
or unless subsequent experience demonstrates the need for
a change in frequency. The Township Health Officer or other
designated officer of the Township reserves the right to
change the schedule of grease draw-off for any facility by
increasing or decreasing the frequency of draw-off times,
based on written reports, site inspections and observations
of operations.

FWD:207
(4) In the event that any food establishment in which a grease
trap is required hereunder shall twice be cited and found
guilty or plead guilty to failure to maintain the trap as
required by Section 5-402.12(B)(3), the Township Health
Officer or other designated official may require the food
establishment, and upon notice to it, it shall comply for a
period of at least three years, with a requirement that it
have the grease trap professionally maintained, inspected
and reviewed at least quarterly by a licensed professional
plumber or other professional regularly engaged in
maintaining grease traps, with documentation of such
inspections and maintenance in a form acceptable to the
Township Health Officer or other designated official
submitted by the food establishment to the Township Health
Officer or other designated official each calendar quarter.
Documentation shall include the identification of the
professional who shall be a licensed plumber or other
professional regularly engaged in the cleaning and
maintenance of grease traps. If the professional is not a
licensed plumber, the same shall be identified and the
qualifications of the same shall be submitted in advance
to the approval of the Township Health Officer or other
designated official. The documentation shall further include
the date of service, which shall be at least once each quarter,
proof of payment to the professional for the inspection and/
or maintenance, and a summary report from the professional
of the work performed and the condition of the grease trap,
including a certification that the same is in proper working
order. Failure to provide such inspection and maintenance
or documentation in a timely manner within 30 days of the
end of the quarter in which service is provided shall be a
violation of this Part 2.
(D) Sewer Authority Review. The size, type of construction, and
location of installation of each interceptor or separator shall be
reviewed by the regulatory authority and the Township Sewer
Authority for compliance with the design criteria presented in
this Section 5-402.12 prior to installation by new food
establishments or existing food establishments without grease
traps. The regulatory authority and the Township Sewer
Authority, at their sole discretion, may use, also, design criteria
and calculations from either the latest edition of the BOCA
National Plumbing Code, the International Plumbing Code or
other normally accepted engineering design criteria considered
appropriate for a particular installation.

affect public health or safety.
2. Definitions. The following words, as used herein, shall be defined in this
part, as follows:
TOWNSHIP — Susquehanna Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.
VACANT PROPERTY — A property with a structure thereon which is
not occupied by the owner, family members of the owner, a guest
of the owner, a lawful tenant or guests of a lawful tenant and shall
include properties in the possession or legal ownership of a lender
or mortgagee or a repossessed property. Vacant property, in this part,
shall not include land without a structure which could be occupied by a
person. Vacant property includes residential, commercial, industrial or
property used for other purposes.
1. The owner of any vacant property shall keep the interior and exterior of
the premises free of garbage and rubbish.
2. The owner of any vacant building shall keep all doors, windows, and
openings from the roof or other areas in good repair, and shall ensure
that the roof is intact and allows for proper stormwater drainage.
Where such doors or windows or entrances to openings are readily
accessible to trespassers, they shall be kept securely locked, fastened,
or otherwise secured. The owner shall take any other measures
prescribed by the Township to prevent unauthorized entry to the
premises by sealing all openings with materials approved by the
Township.
3. A vacant building which is not secured against entry shall be deemed
unsafe under all Building Code provisions in the Codified Ordinances of
Susquehanna Township. The owner of a vacant building that is a
blighting influence on its neighborhood shall secure all spaces designed
as windows with windows that have frames and glazing and all
entryways with doors. Sealing such a property with boards or masonry
or other materials that are not windows with frames and glazing or
entry doors shall not constitute good repair or being locked, fastened or
otherwise secured pursuant to this part. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the owner of a vacant building shall keep all doors, windows and
openings from the roof or other areas in good repair.

knowledge of its vacancy and shall, during the term of vacancy, perform
an inspection at least once a month thereafter. Such inspections shall
determine whether the vacant property is in compliance with the
requirements of this part. If an inspection shows that a vacant property
is not in compliance with the requirements of this part, its owner shall
promptly cause appropriate remediation to occur.
§ 10-504. Designation of Property Manager. [Ord. 15-04, 5/14/2015]
Any owner of any vacant property who resides more than 50 miles outside
of Susquehanna Township and does not customarily and regularly attend to
or maintain a business office within 50 miles of the Township shall designate
a property manager who is able to and will perform the inspections and any
remediation required under this part. This requirement shall not prohibit
an owner who resides in the Township or within 50 miles of the Township
or who customarily or regularly attends to or maintains a business office
within 50 miles of the Township from designating a property manager. The
appointment of a property manager shall not discharge an owner from the
legal responsibility for compliance with this part.
§ 10-505. Documentation of Inspection. [Ord. 15-04, 5/14/2015]
The owner of a property that is vacant shall maintain proper documentation

condition of the property and particularly any provision of this part or
any other ordinance of the Township which is out of compliance; and
documentation of what must be done to bring the property into compliance.
The owner of property may maintain such documentation through a
manager, but the owner continues to be responsible for both inspection
and documentation. On request, the Township or its agents, officers or
employees, during regular business hours, shall be provided access to and,
on request, copies of documentation of inspections.
4. If securely fastened windows and doors fail or are inadequate to
prevent trespassers from entering the building, the owner shall close
and secure all accessible openings using a commercial quality, 14
gauge, rustproof steel security panel or door, or such other materials
deemed by the Township to provide an equivalent level of protection
considering the specific characteristics of the vacant property and its
location. Security panels and doors shall be secured from the building
interior, allow emergency access, and have an exterior finish that allows
for easy removal of graffiti.

determination shall be given to the registered owner and to the designated
property manager, if different, together with an order to comply. A copy of
the notice shall be posted at various conspicuous places on the premises.
Such written notice shall indicate the number of doors, windows, or other
entrances or openings to the building that the owner has failed to secure
or seal in violation of this part. Such notice shall be in addition to a
notice, if any, designating the property as a nuisance, blighted or other
in violation of any other Township code, and violation of this section and
citation therefor shall not restrict action for enforcement or citation under
any other provision of the Codified Ordinances of Susquehanna Township.

designated Code Officer of the Township, in writing, within 10 days of the
notice served by the Township, of the steps being taken to correct the
conditions, together with an estimate of the time required to fully comply

MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS
§ 13-401. Preface; Policy and Intention. [Ord. 99-9, 4/8/1999]
The people and citizens of the Township of Susquehanna acting by and
through their duly elected governing body, this Board of Township
Commissioners, are aware that the practice of body massage under certain
circumstances can scientifically promote physical well-being by (1) reliving
and relaxing muscle tension, (2) stimulating vascular circulation which
enhances the disposition of waste products generated by muscular exercise,
and (3) assisting in the development of muscle tone through a form of
passive exercise. It is further recognized that the physical contact involved
in such practice can provide a source of communication of disease for which
the health and safety of the community requires local government control
and supervision. This Board further recognizes that various businesses
operating under the guise of practicing body massage, sometimes called
"massage parlors" are intended to stimulate sexual and erotic reactions
which this Board believes is contrary to the morals and welfare of this
Township. In addition to regulating the legitimate and bona fide practice
of massage, this Board of Township Commissioners intends to prohibit or
prevent the abuse of said practice for sexual or erotic stimulation and
purposes.

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS OPERATORS
§ 13-501. Findings. [Ord. 99-19, 11/18/1999]
The Board of Commissioners finds that sexually oriented businesses are
frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and
sexual liaisons of a casual nature. The concern over sexually transmitted
diseases is a legitimate health concern of Susquehanna Township which
demands reasonable regulation of sexually oriented businesses in order to
protect the health and well being of its citizens. Permitting and/or licensing
is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that
operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable
regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their
establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses,
because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing
businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to
them, causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values.
It is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, due to their nature,
have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when
they are located in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to
neighborhood blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent
area. Susquehanna Township desires to minimize and control these adverse
effects and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry;
protect the citizens from increase crime; preserve the quality of life;
preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods
and deter the spread of neighborhood blight. It is not the intent of the
Part to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment,
but to enact a content neutral chapter which addresses the secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses. It is not the intent of the Board
of Commissioners to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
§ 13-502. Policy and Intention. [Ord. 99-19. 11/18/1999]
It is the purpose of this Part to regulate sexually oriented businesses
to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the
Township and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent
the continued deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented
businesses within the Township. The provisions of this Part have neither
the purpose not effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content
of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this Part to restrict or deny access
by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment,
or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this Part to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

3. A cable operator shall submit to the Township the rate regulatory forms
required by the FCC, including, but not limited to, FCC Form 1240 and
FCC Form 1205, on a periodic basis and in a timely fashion as required
by applicable federal law and regulations. The deadlines for submission
of such forms are dependent upon the cable operator's election to
employ the annual rate adjustment method or the quarterly rate
adjustment method. Should applicable federal law and/or regulations
be amended to alter the rate adjustment methods, then the cable
operator shall comply with such amendments.
4. A cable operator shall comply with all requests for information, orders
and decisions of the Township. No cable operator shall, in any
information submitted to the Township in making a rate determination
pursuant to an FCC rate regulatory form filing, make any
misrepresentation or willful material omission bearing on any matter
within the Township's jurisdiction.
1. Upon receipt of FCC rate regulatory forms, including, but not limited
to, FCC Form 1240 and FCC Form 1205, from a cable operator
proposing any change in basic service and/or associated equipment
rates, the compliance officer shall review the forms to determine
whether the filing is complete. If the filing is incomplete, the
compliance officer shall notify the cable operator within the applicable
time period required by federal law and regulations and ask the cable
operator to submit such additional information as is necessary to make
the filing complete. The time period for review by the Township shall be
extended for the cable operator to complete the filing in accordance
with applicable federal law and regulations.
2. Upon receipt of completed FCC rate regulatory forms from a cable
operator, the compliance officer shall make an initial determination as
to whether the proposed rate adjustments are reasonable and lawful
pursuant to applicable federal law and regulations. The compliance
officer may engage the services of an expert in cable rate regulation to
assist in making such initial determination.
3. Should the compliance officer make an initial determination that the
cable operator's proposed rates are unreasonable and unlawful, the
compliance officer shall place the issue on the Board of
Commissioners's agenda for public consideration in the form of a ratemaking
proceeding. The Board of Commissioners shall provide a
reasonable opportunity for public comment and for consideration of the
views of interested parties.

FWD:272
§ 13-611. Enforcement. [Ord. 02-16, 12/12/2002, § 11]
In rendering its decisions, the Board of Commissioners shall have the full
authority to order a cable operator to take any and all enforcement actions
permitted by applicable federal law and regulations, including, but not
limited to, the following:
§ 13-612. Penalty. [Ord. 02-16, 12/12/2002, § 12]
In the event that a cable operator does not comply with an order or decision
made pursuant to this Part and directed specifically toward the cable
operator, the Township may assess a fine against the cable operator of not
more than $500 per violation. Each day of continuous violation of any of the
provisions of this Part shall constitute a separate violation.
4. Upon conclusion of the rate-making proceeding, the Board of
Commissioners shall render a decision on whether the cable operator's
proposed rates are reasonable and lawful. The Board of Commissioners
shall issue a written decision if it disapproves an initial rate for basic
service and/or associated equipment in whole or in part, disapproves a
request for a rate increase in whole or in part, or approves a request for
a rate increase in whole or in part over the objections of interested
parties. Public notice shall be given regarding any written decision,
including releasing the text of the written decision to the public.
5. As part of the rate-making proceeding, the Township may require the
production of proprietary information to make a rate determination.
The Township shall state a justification for each item of information
requested and, where related to an FCC form, indicate the question or
section of the form to which the request specifically relates. Upon
request by a cable operator, the parties to a rate proceeding shall have
access to such information subject to the Township's procedures
governing nondisclosure by the parties. Public access to such
proprietary information shall be governed by applicable state and local
law.
A. Ordering a cable operator to implement a reduction in basic service or
associated equipment rates where necessary to bring rates into
compliance with the standards set forth in applicable federal law and
regulations.
B. Prescribing a reasonable rate for basic service or associated equipment
after it determines that a proposed rate is unreasonable and unlawful.
C. Ordering a cable operator to refund to subscribers that portion of
previously paid rates determined to be in excess of the permitted tier
charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the operator has
submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the rate charged as
reasonable. Any such refund order shall be further subject to the
limitations contained in applicable federal law and regulations.

rendered by the Authority through such extension or addition until
the total cost thereof shall have been paid.
B. Extensions not designed and installed by the Authority Plans and
specifications for extensions and additions to a sewer system may
be prepared by qualified persons other than the consulting
engineer for the Authority, provided that the plans and
specifications so prepared shall be submitted for approval of the
consulting engineer for the Authority, and provided further that no
construction shall be undertaken until such plans and
specifications are approved and until a permit is issued by the
Sanitary Water Board for the proposed extension. The reasonable
cost of reviewing and approving plans and specifications imposed
upon the Authority by its consulting engineer shall be paid by the
applicant before final approval of plans and specifications is given.
(1) Extensions to a sewer system may be constructed by any
applicant or his contractor in accordance with plans and
specifications approved as hereinbefore required, provided,
however, that such construction shall be done under the
supervision of the consulting engineer for the Authority or
such other person as the Authority may designate. Such
supervision shall consist of regular inspections during
construction, the cost of which shall be paid by the applicant.
After approval of plans and specifications and before
construction has commenced, the applicant shall post a bond
with the Authority in an amount to be set by the Authority to
insure the payment to the Authority of all obligations due it
under this Part, including the cost of reviewing and approving
plans (if that cost has not already been paid), the cost of
inspection and the cost of replacing or repairing any part of the
system which has not been constructed in a manner
satisfactory to the Authority. In lieu of posting a bond, the
applicant may deposit with the Authority a sum of money
representing the estimated costs of the items for which the
bond may be required which money, if deposited, shall be held
by the Authority solely for the payment of these items. Upon
completion of construction any excess money remaining from
the deposit made shall be returned to the applicant and to the
extent, if any, that the costs involved shall have exceeded the
amount deposited, the applicant shall immediately pay to the
Authority the amount of the deficiency.
(2) Whenever sewers are installed by persons other than the
Authority, the installation and materials shall be made and
furnished to the satisfaction of the Authority and in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the Authority. In the event
that the person installing a sewer extension fails to comply
with the requirements of the Authority, the Authority shall give
notice, in writing, of such noncompliance and in the event that

Part 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 19-101. Short Title.
This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Susquehanna
Township Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 19-102. Statement of Findings.
The governing body of Susquehanna Township finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases non-point
source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of Susquehanna Township and all the
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation);
destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
§ 19-101 FOREWORD § 19-102
FWD:377
§ 19-103. Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare
within Susquehanna Township, Dauphin County, by minimizing the harms

provisions intended to:
§ 19-104. Statutory Authority.
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the Commonwealth.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the
Commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems
close to their source, by regulating activities that cause these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems to the maximum extent
practicable.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
F. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent
scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a minimum
of structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
H. Provide procedures, performance standards, and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
I. Provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and
permanent stormwater management facilities and Best Management
Practices (BMPs) that are constructed and implemented.

conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets,
catch basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels, or storm drains)
primarily used for collecting and conveying stormwater runoff.
SHEET FLOW — Runoff that flows over the ground surface as a thin, even
layer, not concentrated in a channel.
SOIL COVER COMPLEX METHOD — A method of runoff computation
developed by the NRCS that is based on relating soil type and land use/
cover to a runoff parameter called curve number (CN).
§ 19-202 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 19-202
FWD:388
SPILLWAY (EMERGENCY) — A depression in the embankment of a pond
or basin, or other overflow structure, that is used to pass peak discharges
greater than the maximum design storm controlled by the pond or basin.
STATE WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS — The regulatory requirements
to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore water quality under Title 25 of
that Pennsylvania Code and the Clean Streams Law, including, but not
limited to:
STORAGE INDICATION METHOD — A reservoir routing procedure based
on solution of the continuity equation (inflow minus outflow equals the
change in storage) with outflow defined as a function of storage volume and
depth.
STORM FREQUENCY — The number of times that a given storm event
occurs or is exceeded on the average in a stated period of years. See also
"return period."
STORM SEWER — A system of pipes and/or open channels that convey
intercepted runoff and stormwater from other sources, but excludes
domestic sewage and industrial wastes.
STORMWATER — Drainage runoff from the surface of the land resulting
from precipitation, snow, or ice melt.
STORMWATER HOTSPOT — A land use or activity that generates higher
concentrations of hydrocarbons, trace metals, or toxicants than are found
in typical stormwater runoff.
Each stream segment in Pennsylvania has a "designated use," such
as "cold water fishery" or "potable water supply," which is listed in
Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained, under state
regulations.
A.
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Earth disturbance
activities must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses and
maintain the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all
streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection
streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological, and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After earth disturbance
activities are complete, these characteristics can be impacted by
addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes in habitat through
increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result of changes in land
surface area from those activities. Therefore, permanent discharges
to surface waters must be managed to protect the stream bank,
streambed, and structural integrity of the waterway, to prevent these
impacts.
C.
Protection and maintenance of water quality in special protection
streams pursuant to 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.

Record Drawings
5. The purpose of this Section is to ensure consistency of stormwater
management planning between local ordinances and NPDES permitting
(when required) and to ensure that the applicant has a single and clear
set of stormwater management standards to which the applicant is
subject. Susquehanna Township may accept alternative stormwater
management controls, provided that:
A. The applicant, in consultation with Susquehanna Township, PADEP
and/or DCCD, states that meeting the requirements of the volume
controls or rate controls of this Chapter is not possible or creates
an undue hardship.
B. The alternative stormwater management controls, proposed by the
applicant, are documented to be acceptable to Susquehanna
Township, PADEP and/or DCCD for NPDES requirements
§ 19-302 FOREWORD § 19-302
FWD:397
§ 19-303. Volume Controls.
pertaining to post-construction stormwater management
requirements.
C. The alternative stormwater management controls are in
compliance with all other sections of this Chapter, including but not
limited to §§ 19-301.4, 19-302.1, 19-302.2 and 19-302.3.
6. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from rate and
volume control requirements and SWM Site Plan preparation
requirement of this Chapter, provided the activities are performed
according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102. It should be
noted that temporary roadways are not exempt.
7. Agricultural activities are exempt from the requirements of this
Chapter, provided the activities are performed according to the
requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
8. Linear roadway improvement projects that create additional
impervious area are not exempt from the requirements of this Chapter.
However, alternative stormwater management strategies may be
applied at the joint approval of Susquehanna Township and the Dauphin
County Conservation District (if an NPDES permit is required) when
site limitations (such as limited right-of-way) and constraints (as shown
and provided by the applicant), preclude the ability of the applicant to
meet the enforcement of the stormwater management standards in this
Chapter. All strategies must be consistent with PADEP's regulations,
including NPDES requirements.
9. Susquehanna Township may, after an applicant has demonstrated
compliance with §§ 19-302.1, 19-302.2 and 19-302.3, grant a
modification of the requirements of one or more provisions of this
Chapter if the literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that
such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the
purpose and intent of the Ordinance is observed.
A. All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall state in
full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on
which the request is based, the provision or provisions of the
Ordinance involved, and the minimum modification necessary.
1. The low impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual and
in Appendix B of this Chapter14 shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.
2. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
design storm method or the simplified method. For regulated activities
equal to or less than one acre, this Chapter establishes no preference
14.Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this Chapter.
§ 19-302 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 19-303
FWD:398
for either method; therefore, the applicant may select either method
on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on
applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each
methodology, and other factors.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(2) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
(a) Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
on the proposed project site, and contained within the new
proposed limit of disturbance, shall be considered meadow
(good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
B. The simplified method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the design storm method is not
followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
Commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
3. All applicable worksheets from Chapter 8 of the BMP Manual must be
used when establishing volume controls.
4. Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed elevation of
the stormwater BMPs are required when 5,000 square feet or greater of
new impervious surface is added. Infiltration test shall be conducted in
accordance with BMP Manual. Susquehanna Township shall be notified
24 hours prior to infiltration tests being conducted as to provide an
opportunity for Susquehanna Township to witness the tests.

§ 19-304. Rate Controls.
1. Lands contained within Susquehanna Township that have not had
release rates established under an approved Act 167 Stormwater
Management Plan:
A. Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year storms.
2. Lands contained within Susquehanna Township that have had release
rates established under an approved watershed-wide Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan [Paxton Creek, Spring Creek (West), and
Fishing Creek]:
A. Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, fifty-, and onehundred-
year storms.
B. For the two-, ten-, and twenty-five-year storms, the postdevelopment
peak discharge rates shall be in accordance with the
approved release rate map for the individual watershed.
3. For lands contained within a Paxton Creek Watershed Provisional No
Detention District:
A. These watershed areas may discharge post-development peak
runoff without detention facilities. However, the applicant must
prove that the "local" runoff conveyance facility which transports
runoff from the site to the main channel has adequate capacity to
safely transport unattenuated increased peak flows for a twentyfive-
year storm in accordance with § 19-305. If there is inadequate
capacity, the applicant shall either use 100% release rate control or
provide increased capacity of downstream drainage facilities to
convey increase peak flows consistent with § 19-305. When
determining if adequate capacity exists in the local watershed
drainage network, the applicant must assume that the entire local
watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new
development will use the least restrictive runoff controls specified
by this Chapter.
4. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rate; however, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site.
5. For a proposed development site which is located within two or more
release rate districts, the maximum runoff discharged at any point shall
be equal to the release rate for the district in which the discharge point
is located. In the even that a portion of the site is located in a
provisional no detention area, no runoff from portions of the site located
§ 19-304 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 19-304
FWD:400
§ 19-305. Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis.
Any downstream capacity hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with
this Chapter shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
in areas subject to release rate controls may be drained to or through
the provisional no detention area.
A. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the
increased runoff associated with a twenty-five-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based upon
criteria included in the PADEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Program Manual.
B. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the
increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without creating any
hazard to persons or property.
C. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers, or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance
with PADEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and, at a minimum,
pass the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff, except for
facilities located within a designated floodplain area which must, at a
minimum, conform to FEMA and local floodplain ordinance
requirements.

DESIGN CRITERIA
§ 19-501. Design Criteria for Stormwater Management and
Drainage Facilities.
1. General Design Guidelines.
A. Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless (1) the watersheds are sub-watersheds of a
common watershed which join together within the perimeter of the
property; (2) the effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate
discharge onto adjacent lands; or (3) easements from the affected
landowner(s) are provided.
B. Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow type condition.
C. Stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are encouraged (e.g.,
rooftop storage, drywells, cisterns, recreation area ponding,
diversion structures, porous pavements, holding tanks, infiltration
systems, stream channel storage, inline storage in storm sewers,
and grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and
constructed in accordance with the latest technical guidance
published by PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed
engineering plans and performance capabilities and supporting
site specific soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration

requiring a berm or earthen embankment shall be designed to
provide an emergency spillway to handle peak rate of stormwater
runoff up to and including the one-hundred-year post-development
flow, with a blocked primary outlet structure. The height of
embankment must be set as to provide a minimum one-foot of
freeboard through the spillway, above the maximum water surface
elevation, computed when the spillway functions for the onehundred-
year post-development inflow, with a blocked outlet
structure. The primary outflow structure must be designed to pass
all design storms (up to and including the one-hundred-year event)
without discharging through the emergency spillway. The
maximum water depth within any stormwater management facility
shall be no greater than eight feet when functioning through the
primary outlet structure.
B. Emergency spillways shall be armored to prevent erosion during
the one-hundred-year post-development flow, with blocked primary
outlet structure. Synthetic liners or rip-rap may be used, and
calculations sufficient to support proposed armor must be
provided. An earthen plug must be used to accurately control the
spillway invert if rip-rap is the proposed armoring material.
Emergency spillway armor must extend up the sides of the spillway,
and continue at full width to a minimum of 10 feet past the toe of
slope.
C. A stormwater management facility berm cross section must be at
least five feet wide at the top and eight feet wide through the
emergency spillway. For fill embankments, the side slopes shall be

H. Conventional, non-BMP stormwater management facilities (i.e., dry
detention basins) must empty over a period of time not less than 24
hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the facility's
inflow hydrograph. Infiltration tests performed at the facility
locations and proposed basin bottom depths, in accordance with
the BMP Manual, must support time-to-empty calculations if
infiltration is a factor is the sizing of the stormwater management
facility.
I. Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities to promote water quality and groundwater
recharge for frequent storm events. Facilities designed as water
quality/infiltration BMPs may have a bottom slope of zero. Minimal
maintenance, saturationtolerant vegetation must be provided in
basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs. Conventional,
non-BMP stormwater management facilities must have a minimum
slope of 1% extending radially out from the primary outlet
structure. Water storage below the lowest outlet structure stage
(i.e., dead storage) is permitted in stormwater management
facilities designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs.
J. Stormwater management facilities bottom elevations must be
greater than adjacent floodplain elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS
analysis). If no floodplain is defined, bottom elevations must be
higher than existing ground elevations 50 feet from top of stream
bank in the facilities' vicinity.
K. Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the one-hundred-year
floodplain elevation may be used for all design storms, or the
applicant may elect to determine flood elevations of the adjacent
watercourse for each design storm. The floodplain is assumed to be
50 feet from top of stream bank in areas where a floodplain is not
designated, or where no other evidence is provided.
L. Exceptions to these requirements may be made at the discretion of
Susquehanna Township for BMPs that retain or detain water, but

FWD:407
are of a much smaller scale than traditional stormwater
management facilities.
3. Storm Sewer Facilities.
A. Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from
a ten-year design storm without surcharging inlets where
appropriate. When connecting to an existing storm sewer system,
the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed system will not
exacerbate any existing stormwater problems and that adequate
downstream capacity exists.
B. A minimum pipe size of 15 inches in diameter shall be used in all
roadway systems (public or private) proposed for construction.

per second when flowing full, but in all cases, the slope shall be no
less than 0.5%. Arch pipe of equivalent cross-sectional area may be
substituted in lieu of circular pipe where cover or utility conflict
conditions exist.
C. In proposed curbed roadway sections, the maximum encroachment
of water on the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a
through travel lane or one inch less than the depth of curb during
the ten-year design storm of five minute duration. Gutter depth
shall be verified by inlet capture/capacity calculations that account
for road slope and opening area. The maximum distance between
inlets in curbed roadway sections shall be no more than 600 feet,
however access to underground pipes shall be provided every 300
feet.
D. Standard Type "C" inlets with eight-inch hoods shall be used along
vertical concrete curbs roadway networks. Type "C" inlets with teninch
hoods that provide a two-inch sump condition may be used
with approval of the Municipal Engineer when roadway
longitudinal slopes are 1.0% or less.
E. For inlets containing a change in pipe size, the elevation for the
crown of the pipes shall be the same or the smaller pipe's crown
shall be at a higher elevation.
F. All inlets shall provide a minimum two-inch drop between the
lowest inlet pipe invert elevation and the outlet pipe invert

site.
3. Rainfall Values.
A. Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
§ 19-501 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 19-502
FWD:410
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
B. Soil Cover Complex Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type II,
twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in conjunction
with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or consistent with the
following table:
Return Interval
(year)
24-Hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 2.40
2 2.90
10 4.36
25 5.43
50 6.38
100 7.48
4. Peak Flow Rates.
A. Rational Method: May be used for drainage areas up to 20 acres.
Extreme caution should be used by the qualified professional if the
watershed has more than one main drainage channel, if the
watershed is divided so that hydrologic properties are significantly
different in one verses the other, if the time of concentration
exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff volume is an important
factor. The combination of Rational Method hydrographs based on
timing shall be prohibited.
(1) The use of the Modified Rational Method to design stormwater
management facilities must be approved by the Municipal
Engineer.
B. Soil Cover Complex Method: May be used for drainage areas
greater than 20 acres. This method is recommended for design of
stormwater management facilities and where stormwater runoff
volume must be taken into consideration.
C. For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
5. Runoff Coefficients.
A. Rational Method: Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).15
B. Soil Cover Complex Method: Use Table C-2 (Appendix C).
15.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this Chapter.
§ 19-502 FOREWORD § 19-502
FWD:411
C. For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious areas condition shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
D. For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing impervious area, when present on
the project site, and contained within the new proposed limit of
disturbance, shall be considered meadow (good condition) for
predevelopment hydrologic calculations for redevelopment.
6. Design Storm.
A. All drainage facilities (inlets, pipes, and swales) shall be designed
to safely convey the ten-year storm.
B. All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundredyear
hydrographs through the facility using the storage indication
(Modified Puls) method. The design storm hydrograph shall be
computed using a calculation method that produces a full
hydrograph.
C. The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development one-hundred-year
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
D. All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a municipal road shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum one-foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway.
E. All design within state or federal rights-of-way or that falls under
the design criteria of any higher authority must meet the
requirements of that agency in addition to meeting the minimum
requirements of this Chapter.
7. Time of Concentration.
A. Time of concentration shall be computed using the NRCS
Segmental Method as described in TR-55 (SCS 1986 or most
current update). The length of sheet flow shall be limited to 100
feet. The Manning's "n" Roughness Coefficient for TR-55 sheet flow
can be found in Table C-4 (Appendix C).16 Time of concentration for
channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's equation.
B. For sites with insignificant channelized flow and less than 20%
imperviousness coverage, the time of concentration may be
computed using the NRCS equation for lag time:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6)* 60] (minutes)
16.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this Chapter.
§ 19-502 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 19-502
FWD:412
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = Average overland slope of watershed
(percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined
by: S = [(1000/CN) - 10]
CN = NRCS Curve Number for watershed as
defined by the NRCS Loss Method
C. Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(1) The post-development time of concentration shall never be
greater that the predevelopment time of concentration for any
watershed or subwatershed.
(2) The minimum time of concentration for any watershed shall be
five minutes.
(3) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute time of
concentration for any post-development watershed or
subwatershed without providing any computations.
(4) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment time of concentration paths. A five-minute
time of concentration cannot be assumed for predevelopment.
(5) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purpose of time of
concentration calculations.
8. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining predevelopment flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be removed from peak runoff rates in the postdevelopment
analysis. New, additional contributing runoff shall not be
directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
9. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning's equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. The Manning's equation should not
§ 19-502 FOREWORD § 19-502
FWD:413
be used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from Table C-3
(Appendix C).17 Inlet control shall be checked at all inlet boxes to
ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year design event is
contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
10. Susquehanna Township may approve the use of any generally accepted
full hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.
11. Susquehanna Township has the authority to require that computed
existing runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions
and site history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual
physical calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of
concentration values should be utilized at a particular site, then
appropriate variations may be made upon review and approval of
Susquehanna Township.

authority or any other entity causing an opening or excavation to be
made in streets in the Township to remove the existing material and fill
the excavation compacted in eight-inch layers. With regard to fill,
materials used, wearing and finish courses, asphalt, surfacing, and
sealants or other work, all applications shall be made without ridges
and/or depressions and shall be maintained in at least as good condition
as it was prior to excavation for a period of at least two years. Edge
shall be sealed with two applications of material to then-current
standards or specifications of the Pennsylvania Department of

then other applicable standards as adopted by the Township. To assure
compliance with this provision, the person, firm, partnership,
corporation, authority or other entity obtaining a permit shall advise
the Township, in writing, within adequate time prior to the time at
which work is to be performed, to allow the Township to inspect or
supervise the same. No cut or opening may be closed until the Township
has inspected the same and approved the closure.
2. In the event that more than 25% of the public street or way from curb to
curb is cut or disturbed, the Township Secretary shall require that the
entire street or way be resurfaced from side to side for a length or
distance of up to the next manhole in each direction or up to a maximum
of 400 feet of street or way beyond the disturbance or cut.
3. All streets following cut and restoration shall comply with the
requirements of § 22-603, Subsection 6, of Chapter 22 of the Codified
Ordinances of the Township of Susquehanna. If a cut or other permit
has been closed, the person, firm, partnership, corporation, authority or
other entity cutting or opening the street and obtaining a permit
hereunder remains responsible for all maintenance until final
inspection of the closed cut and, in addition, a two-year maintenance
bond will be required by the Township after closure. No final
acceptance of a restored cut or opening in the street shall be approved
unless the street so cut is mud-free, restored to its proper condition and

Prior to obtaining a permit, the applicant therefor shall deposit with the
Township financial security or bond in the amount determined by the
Township Engineer sufficient to cover the cost of restoration of all curb
cuts and all streets, thoroughfare ways, cuts or openings and other costs
of improvements or restoration of any property disturbed. The amount of
the financial security to be posted shall be equal to 120% of the cost of
completion of work and restoration as of six months following the date
scheduled for completion of the project. To be approved, acceptable bonds
any walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights, fire hydrants, shade trees,
water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other improvements
or items affected by the cut have been restored as required by the
Township.
4. As part of the applicant's permit, the applicant shall delineate the
location at which any construction equipment, material or job trailer
shall be placed and whether on public or private lands, if not controlled
by the applicant, the applicant shall document written permission for
use of the same from the owner thereof. Further, the applicant shall
delineate the duration during which construction equipment, material
or trailer shall be at the site specified and, in the event that the duration
set forth is exceeded, an amendment shall be required to the
application. It shall be the duty of the applicant to properly maintain the
area on which any equipment, material or trailer is stored or placed in
compliance with all applicable ordinances, statutes and codes and so as
not to be a nuisance to the public or interfere with any rights of public
access and so as to avoid the same being an eyesore. Unless the
applicant documents a written agreement from the owner of any lands
on which equipment, material or a trailer is placed to the contrary, the
applicant must, in each case, as part of their bonded work, restore the
area on which any equipment, material or trailer has been placed or
stored to its pre-storage condition.
5. All drilling, cutting, or repairing on any surfaced or finished public
street or way in the Township shall be by directional drilling technique
approved by the Township. Missile drilling or impact drilling which may
cause pressure, expansion, or bulging in areas adjacent to the drilling
on a public street or way is prohibited.
6. Except in emergency situations, no opening or excavation requiring a
permit under the Codified Ordinances of the Township shall be
commenced except at a time during the year when the same may be
restored and resurfaced in full within 30 days of commencement of
work, and such restoration, including resurfacing, shall be completed
within 30 days of commencement of work. Because final resurfacing
cannot be done in the coldest of winter months, except in emergency
conditions, no permit shall be issued for regularly scheduled work
which shall commence after November 1 through March 1 of each
calendar year.

the Board of Commissioners, may cause the same to be done in the

and the surface maintained as aforesaid, in a safe condition and at the
proper grade, of which the said Engineer, or other person designated,

regulations.
A.
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless of
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Earth disturbance
activities must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses and
maintain the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all
streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection
streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological, and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After earth disturbance
activities are complete, these characteristics can be impacted by
addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes in habitat through
increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result of changes in land
surface area from those activities. Therefore, permanent discharges
to surface waters must be managed to protect the stream bank,
streambed, and structural integrity of the waterway, to prevent these
impacts.
C.
Protection and maintenance of water quality in special protection
streams pursuant to 25 Pennsylvania Code Chapter 93.

gross tract area minus the constrained land; Exhibit VII34
provides a worksheet to calculate the adjusted tract area.
(2) Constrained land equals the sum of the following:
(a) All land within the rights-of-way of existing public streets
or highways, or within the rights-of-way for existing or
proposed utility lines.
(b) All land under existing private streets.
(c) Wetlands: multiply the acreage of designated wetlands by
0.95.
(d) Floodway: multiply the acreage within the floodway by 1.0.
(e) Floodplains: multiply the non-wetland portion of the onehundred-
year floodplain by 0.50.
(f) Steep slopes: multiply by the acreage of land with natural
ground slopes exceeding 25% by 0.80.
34.Editor's Note: Exhibit VII is included as an attachment to this Chapter.
§ 22-405 FOREWORD § 22-405
FWD:505
(g) Moderately steep slopes: multiply by the acreage of land
with natural ground slopes of between 15% and 25% by
0.60.
(3) If a portion of the tract is underlain by more than one natural
feature, the acreage shall be subject to the most restrictive
feature (example: a feature multiplied by a factor of 0.80 would
be more restrictive than a feature multiplied by 0.60).
(4) Natural features that are located in a portion of the tract which
includes rights-of-way and streets described in
§ 22-405(2)(K)(2)(a) and (b) above, shall not be deducted in
calculating the adjusted tract area.
(5) The maximum number of permitted dwelling units equals the
adjusted tract area divided by the density factor for the tract as
indicated in Part 17 of the Susquehanna Township Zoning
Ordinance.
L. Yield Plan (conventional subdivision design) — Optional method in
addition to the Adjusted Tract Area calculations, § 22-405(2)(K)
above, for calculating density in conservation design subdivisions
and in accordance with Part 17 of the Susquehanna Township
Zoning Ordinance. The yield plan shall be based upon the density
factor of the chosen option applied to the gross tract acreage. The
yield plan shall meet the following requirements:
(1) The plan shall be prepared as a conceptual, realistic layout in
accordance with the standards herein. The plan shall be drawn
to scale. The plan shall take into consideration existing natural
features of the area. The plan is not required to be based on a
field survey.
(2) The plan shall use the density factor of options 1 or 2 as
minimum lot area and the standards of the underlying districts.
(3) No more than 20% of the minimum required lot area may
consist of land within the one-hundred-year floodplain and only
then if it is free of wetlands.
M. Preliminary Greenway/Open Space Lands and Common Facilities
Ownership and Management Plan for all subdivisions and land
developments which include greenways/open space lands. Using
the preliminary plan as a base map, the boundaries, acreage and
proposed ownership of all proposed greenway areas shall be
shown. In addition, the applicant shall also submit a Preliminary
Greenway Ownership and Management Plan detailing the entities
responsible for maintaining various elements of the property, and
describing management objectives and techniques for each part of
the property. Such management plans shall be consistent with the
requirements of § 27-2116 of the Township Zoning Ordinance
§ 22-405 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-405
FWD:506
("Ownership and Management of Greenway Land and Common
Facilities").
N. Mixed-Use Development Land Development Calculations. The
following information and calculations shall be provided for
developments with a mixture of residential and nonresidential uses
on the same tract or in the same building (mixed-use
developments) as permitted in the Susquehanna Township Zoning

types of nonresidential uses (e.g., office, institutional,
recreational) are not required to be listed separately.
Residential uses shall be listed by dwelling unit type, including
single-family detached, single-family semi-detached, singlefamily
attached and multiple family, as defined and permitted
in the Susquehanna Township Zoning Ordinance. Permitted
accessory commercial uses contained in buildings occupied by
one or more of the permitted principal uses are not required to
be listed.
(2) The percentage of the development to be devoted to
nonresidential uses and each type of residential dwelling unit
shall be provided by the developer/applicant. Under no
circumstances shall the percentage of the development of
various categories when added together exceed 100%.
(3) The percentage of nonresidential and residential dwelling unit
types provided in subsection N(2) above shall be applied to the
development tract and converted to acres for each category of
nonresidential and residential dwelling unit type. The
calculated acreage shall be used by the developer/applicant for
the calculation of density and maximum and minimum
coverages, whichever are applicable, regardless if it is to be
developed on a separate area of the parcel or in a mixed-use
building. An example is provided in Exhibit IX,35 herein.
(4) The maximum dwelling units by type shall be determined
based on the calculated acreage and the applicable district,
bulk and area requirements from the Susquehanna Township
Zoning Ordinance. The maximum dwelling units on the tract
shall be the sum of all maximum dwelling units by type.
(5) The maximum building coverage and maximum lot coverage in
acres for the tract shall be the sum of the maximum acreage
required for all residential acres, plus the maximum acreage
required for the nonresidential acres calculated in subsection
N(3) above and in accordance with the applicable district of

the Susquehanna Township Zoning Ordinance, unless
otherwise stipulated in the district regulations.
(6) The minimum vegetative coverage shall be the sum of the
minimum acreage required for all residential acres plus the
minimum acreage required for the nonresidential acres
calculated in subsection N(3) above and in accordance with the
applicable district of the Susquehanna Township Zoning
Ordinance, unless otherwise stipulated in the district
regulations.
(7) For mixed-use buildings with nonresidential uses (multiple
family) the minimum lot width shall be 150 feet, unless
otherwise stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance district
regulations.
1. The applicant shall, not later than 12 months after the date of approval
of the preliminary plan, for that portion he intends to develop, file with
the Township Code Enforcement Officer a final plan. Such filing shall
include as part of the formal submission all the material and other data
required under the final plan specifications as listed in § 22-407 of this
Chapter. Failure to comply with the time limitation herein provided
shall make the approval of the preliminary plan null and void unless an
extension of time is granted in accordance with § 22-404(9) herein.
2. The final plan shall incorporate all the changes and modifications
required by the Board of Commissioners; otherwise it shall conform to
the approved preliminary plan, and it may constitute only that portion
of the approved preliminary plan which the applicant proposes to
record and develop at the time, provided that such portion conforms
with all the requirements of this Chapter.
3. One reproducible linen (or other reproducible material of equal quality)
copy of the final plan and 11 prints shall be filed by the applicant with
the Township Code Enforcement Officer 17 days prior to the meeting of
the Planning Commission at which meeting consideration is desired.
One copy of the site or land development plan shall be submitted and
will be reviewed by the Public Safety Committee for ingress/egress of
roads, fire hydrants, and general layout.
4. Completion of Improvements or Guarantee Thereof Prerequisite to
Final Plan Approval.
A. No plan shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such
plan have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by
this Chapter and any walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights, fire
hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers
and other improvements as may be required by this Chapter have
§ 22-405 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-406
FWD:508
been installed in accordance with this Chapter. In lieu of the
completion of any improvements required as a condition for the
final approval of a plan, including improvements or fees otherwise
required by his Chapter, the developer may deposit with the
Township financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the
costs of such improvements or common amenities including basins
and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open
space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be
required in accordance with any land use ordinance.
B. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing,
the Board of Commissioners shall furnish the developer with a
signed coy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plan
contingent upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory financial
security. The final plan or record plan shall not be signed nor
recorded until the financial improvements agreement is executed.
The resolution or letter of contingent approval shall expire and be
deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement is not
executed within 90 days unless a written extension is granted by
the Board of Commissioners; such extension shall not be
unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the request
of the developer.
C. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonable
withheld. Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in
such lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial
security for the purposes of this Section.
D. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by
the party posting the financial security, provided that said bonding
company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such
business within the Commonwealth.
E. Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the
public the completion of any improvements which may be required
on or before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or
accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements.
F. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer. Annually, the Township may adjust the
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost
of the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled
for completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
said adjustment, the Township may require the developer to post
§ 22-406 FOREWORD § 22-406
FWD:509
additional security equal to said 110%. Any additional security shall
be posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection.
G. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
Submitted by an applicant or developer and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of
such cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the
Township engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good
cause shown. If the applicant or developer and the Township are
unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or developer.
The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair
and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a
third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer
shall be paid equally by the Township and the applicant or
developer.
H. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year form the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an
amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using above bidding procedure.
I. In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the Board of Commissioners may authorize submission of final
plans by sections or stages of development subject to such
requirements or guarantees as to improvements in future section
or stages of development as it finds essential for the protection of
any finally approved section of the development.
J. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Commissioners to release or authorize the release, from time to
time, of such portions of the financial security necessary for
payment to the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any
such requests shall be in writing addressed to the Board of
Commissioners, and the Board of Commissioners shall have 45
days from receipt of such request within which to allow the
Township engineer to certify, in writing, to the Board of
Commissioners that such portion of the work upon the
improvements has been completed in accordance with the
approved plan. Upon such certification the Board of Commissioners
shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending
institution of an amount as estimated by the Township engineer
§ 22-406 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-406
FWD:510
fairly representing the value of the improvements completed or,
if the Board of Commissioners fails to act within said forty-fiveday
period, the Board of Commissioners shall be deemed to have
approved the release of funds as requested. The Board of
Commissioners may, prior to final release at the time of completion
and certification by its engineer, require retention of 10% of the
estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
K. Where the Board of Commissioners accepts dedication of all or
some of the required improvements following completion, the
Board of Commissioners may require the posting of financial
security to secure structural integrity of said improvements as well
as the functioning of said improvements in accordance with the
design and specifications as depicted on the final plan for term not
to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication.
Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise
required in this Section with regard to installation of such
improvements, and the amount of the financial security shall not
exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
L. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public
utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from the
Township, financial security to assure proper completion and
maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the
regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority
and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise
required by this section.
M. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition of the final approval of a plan
as set forth in this Section, the Township shall not condition the
issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the
erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon
the lots or land as depicted upon the final plan upon actual
completion of the improvements depicted upon the approved final
plan. Moreover, if said financial security has been provided,
occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall
not be withheld following: the improvement of the streets providing
access to and from existing public roads to such building or
buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as
depicted upon the approved plan, either upon the lot or lots or
beyond the lots in question if such improvements are necessary for
the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
5. Release from Improvement Bond.
A. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of
§ 22-406 FOREWORD § 22-406
FWD:511
Commissioners, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy
thereof to the Township Engineer. The Board of Commissioners
shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and
authorize the Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid
improvements. The Township Engineer shall, thereupon, file a
report in writing, with the Board of Commissioners, and shall
promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified
or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within
30 days after receipt by the Township Engineer of the aforesaid
authorization from the Board of Commissioners; said report shall
be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said
improvements, either in whole or in part and if said improvements
or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected
by the Township Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of
reasons for such non approval or rejection.
B. The Board of Commissioners shall notify the developer, within 15
days of receipt of the engineer's report, in writing by certified or
registered mail, of the action of said Board of Commissioners with
relation thereto.
C. If the Board of Commissioners or the Township Engineer fails to
comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all
improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the
developer shall be released from all liability, pursuant to this
performance guaranty or other security agreement.
D. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Board of Commissioners, the developer
shall proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
E. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Board of Commissioners of the
Township Engineer.
F. Where herein reference is made to the Township Engineer, he shall
be as a consultant thereto.
G. The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Township for the
reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection or
improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by
resolution of the Board of Commissioners and as from the time to
time amended.
(1) In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such
expense in connection with the inspection of improvements,
the applicant shall, within 10 working days of the date of
billing, notify the Township that such expenses are disputed as
unreasonable or unnecessary in which case the Township shall
§ 22-406 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-406
FWD:512
not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development due
to the applicant's request over disputed engineer expenses.
(2) If within 20 days from the date of billing, the Township and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Township
shall jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another
professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania to review the said expenses and make a
determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable
and necessary.
(3) The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such
evidence and review such documentation as the professional
engineer in his or her sole opinion deems necessary and render
a decision within 50 days of the billing date. The applicant shall
be required to pay the entire amount determined in the
decision immediately.
(4) In the event that the Township and applicant cannot agree
upon the professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days
of the billing date, then, upon application of either party, the
President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial
district in which the Township is located (or if at the time there
be no President Judge, then the senior active judge then
sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in that case, shall be
neither the Township Engineer nor any professional engineer
who has been retained by, or performed services for, the
Township or the applicant within the preceding five years.
(5) The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining
the reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the
applicant if the amount of payment required in the decision is
equal to or greater than the original bill. If the amount of
payment required in the decision is less than the original bill by
$1,000 or more, the Township shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer, but otherwise the Township and the
applicant shall each pay 1/2 of the fee of the appointed
professional engineer.
6. Before acting on any subdivision plan, the Board of Commissioners may
hold a public hearing thereon after public notice.
7. The Board of Commissioners, upon the recommendation of the
Commission, shall act on any such final plan not later than 90 days
following the date of the regular meeting of the Board of
Commissioners or the Planning Commission (which ever first reviews
the application) following the day of application is filed, provided that
should the said next regular meeting occur more than 30 days following
the filing of the application, the said ninety-day period shall be
measured from the 30th day following the day the application has been
§ 22-406 FOREWORD § 22-406
FWD:513
filed. In the event that any modification of requirements from this
Chapter is requested by the applicant or is deemed necessary by the
Commission for approval, the alteration and the reason for its necessity
shall be entered in the records of the Commission.
A. The Dauphin County Planning Commission shall review the final
plan and data and shall return one copy of a written report stating
their suggestions for modifications and design changes to the
Planning Commission within 45 days of their receipt of same or
forfeit their right to review.
B. The Board of Commissioners shall determine whether the final plan
shall be approved, or disapproved, and shall notify the applicant in
writing thereof, including, if approved with conditions or
disapproved, a statement of reasons for such action, not later than
15 days following the decision. If said final plan shall be approved
with conditions, the applicant shall either accept or reject said
conditions, in writing addressed to the Board of Commissioners,
not later than 45 days following the date of said decision. Should
the applicant reject said conditions, fail to fulfill said conditions or
fail to communicate his rejection, acceptance or fulfillment of said
conditions in writing addressed to the Board of Commissioners
within said forty-five-day period, the approval, with conditions, of
the final plan shall be deemed to be rescinded and said final plan
shall be deemed to be disapproved without further action by the
Board of Commissioners. Nothing contained herein shall require
plans not strictly in conformity with the Susquehanna Township
Subdivision Land Development Ordinance to be approved with
conditions but, rather, the Board may, at its discretion, reject plans
which may be approved conditionally.
C. Before acting on any subdivision plan the Board of Commissioners
may hold a public hearing thereon after public notice.
D. When the application is not approved in terms as filed, the decision
shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite
the provisions of this Chapter, statute or other ordinance relied
upon.
E. Failure of the Board of Commissioners to render a decision and
communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner
required herein shall be deemed an approval of the application in
terms as presented unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an
extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of
presentation of communication of the decision, in which case,
failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of
presentation of communication shall have like effect. (A sample
Agreement to Extend the Time for Rendering and Communicating a
Decision on Certain Preliminary and/or Final Subdivision Plans is
contained in Exhibit III36 herein.) An extension of time shall not be
§ 22-406 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-406
FWD:514
exceeded more than twice in one year from the original date of
filing without a refilling fee of 50% of the first fee.
8. Upon final approval of plan, where the proposed subdivision and/or land
development abuts a State highway (legislative route, Pennsylvania
route or United States route), the applicant shall provide written
evidence that the plan has been submitted to the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation for their review and concurrence with
the proposed design for driveway access and drainage required for
issuance of the Department's Highway Occupancy Permits.
9. No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be made on any
final plan of a subdivision or land development after approval has been
given by the Board of Commissioners, and endorsed in writing on the
plan, unless the plan is first resubmitted to the Board of
Commissioners.
10. Notification of Approval or Conditional Approval. The Board of
Commissioners shall determine whether the final plan shall be
approved, or disapproved, and shall notify the applicant in writing
thereof, including, if approved with conditions or disapproved, a
statement of the reasons for such action, not later than 15 days
following the decision. If said final plan shall be approved with
conditions, the applicant shall either accept or reject said conditions, in
writing addressed to the Board of Commissioners, not later than 45
days following the date of said decision. Should the applicant reject said
conditions, fail to fulfill said conditions or fail to communicate his
rejection, acceptance or fulfillment of said conditions in writing
addressed to the Board of Commissioners within said forty-five-day
period the approval, with conditions, of the final plan shall be deemed
to be rescinded and said final plan shall be deemed to be disapproved
without further action by the Board of Commissioners.
11. Recording Plans and Deeds.
A. Upon the approval of a final plan, the developer shall within 90
days of such final approval record such plan in the office of the
recorder of deeds in the County. The Recorder of Deeds shall not
accept any plan for recording unless such plan officially notes the
approval of the Board of Commissioners, and review by the County
Planning Agency.
B. The recording of the plan shall not constitute grounds for
assessment increases until such time as lots are sold or
improvements are installed on the land included within the subject
plan.
12. Effect of Change in this Chapter. Changes in this Chapter shall affect
plans as follows:
36.Editor's Note: Exhibit III is included as an attachment to this Chapter.
§ 22-406 FOREWORD § 22-406
FWD:515
A. From the time an application for approval of a plan, whether
preliminary or final, is duly filed as provided in this Chapter, and
while such application is pending approval or disapproval, no
change or amendment of this Chapter, zoning or other governing
ordinance or plan shall affect the decision on such application
adversely to the applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to a
decision in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was
duly filed. The applicant shall be entitled to final approval in
accordance with the terms of the approved preliminary application
as hereinafter provided. However, if any application is properly and
finally denied, any subsequent application shall be subject to the
intervening change in governing regulations.
B. When an application for approval of a plan, whether preliminary or
final, has been approved without conditions or approved by the
applicant's acceptance of conditions, no subsequent change or
amendment in this Chapter, zoning or other governing ordinance or
plan shall be applied to affect adversely the right of the applicant to
commence and to complete any aspect of the approved
development in accordance with the terms of such approval within
five years from such approval.
C. Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the
aforesaid five-year period shall be counted from the date of the
preliminary approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms of a
preliminary approval, the terms shall be construed in the light of
the provisions of this Chapter or the governing ordinance or plans
as they stood at the time when the application for such approval
was duly filed.
D. Where the landowner has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plan within the aforesaid
five-year limit, or any extension thereof as may be granted by the
Board of Commissioners, no change of any ordinance or plan
enacted subsequent to the date of filing of the preliminary plan
shall modify or revoke any aspect of the approved final plan
pertaining to zoning classifications or density, lot, building, street
or utility location.
E. In the case of a preliminary plan calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed
by the landowners with the preliminary plan delineating all
proposed sections as well as deadlines within which applications
for final plan approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such
schedule shall be updated annually by the applicant on or before
approval of the final section has been granted and any modification
in the aforesaid schedule shall be subject to approval of the Board
of Commissioners in its discretion.

Commissioners in its discretion. Provided the landowner has not
defaulted with regard to or violated any of the conditions of the
preliminary plan approval, including compliance with landowner's
aforesaid schedule of submission of final plans for the various
sections, then the aforesaid protections afforded by substantially
completing the improvements depicted upon the final plan within
five years shall apply and for any section or sections, beyond the
initial section, in which the required improvements have not been
substantially completed within said five-year period the aforesaid
protections shall apply for an additional term or terms of three
years from the date of final plan approval for each section.
G. Failure of landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of
submission of final plans for the various sections shall subject any
such section to any and all changes in this Chapter, zoning, and
other governing ordinance enacted by the Township subsequent to
the date of the initial preliminary plan submission.

Part 5
DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 22-501. Application.
§ 22-502. Streets. [Amended 6/11/2009 by Ord. 09-04]
1. The following principles, standards, and requirements will be applied
by the Board of Commissioners and Planning Commission in their
review and evaluation of all subdivision and land development plan
applications.
2. The standards and requirements contained herein shall be considered
the minimum for the promotion of the public health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare.
3. Where literal compliance with the standards and requirements
contained herein is clearly impractical, the Board of Commissioners
may modify or waive such through the modification of requirements
process set forth in Part 15 of this Chapter.
4. Subdivision and land development plans shall be given due
consideration to Official Plans of the Township of Susquehanna,
Dauphin County region, or to such parts thereof as may be adopted
pursuant to statute.
5. Proposed land uses shall conform to the Susquehanna Township Zoning
Ordinance (Chapter 27), as amended.
6. Land subject to hazards to life, health, or property, such as may arise
from fire, flood, disease, or other causes, shall not be planned for
development purposes unless such hazards have been eliminated or
unless the plan shall show adequate safeguards against them, which
shall be approved by the Township and/or appropriate regulatory
agencies.
7. Whenever a subdivision or land development plat or plan is submitted
which sets forth new streets or other ways of ingress and egress, two
separate points of ingress to and egress from the land affected must be
designated thereon. Such points of ingress and egress must be
designed and built to conform to the rules and regulations of
Susquehanna Township for public streets. An applicant may request a
waiver of this requirement and shall in support thereof, present
evidence that due to topography, site distance, wetlands, environmental
constraints, configuration of land, distance between intersections or
other factors, it is impractical to have a second way of ingress and
egress. Upon due consideration of these factors, the Board of
Commissioners, in their sole discretion, may grant the waiver.
1. General Standards.
§ 22-501 FOREWORD § 22-502
FWD:523
A. Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or
parts thereof as have been officially adopted by Susquehanna
Township and shall be coordinated with existing or proposed
streets in adjoining subdivisions or land developments. Further,
proposed streets shall be properly related to county, regional or
State transportation plans as have been prepared and adopted as
prescribed by law.
B. Streets shall be laid out to preserve the integrity of their design.
Local access streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by
through traffic and, where possible, collector and arterial streets
shall be designed for use by through traffic.
C. Streets shall be related to the topography so as to establish lots and
satisfactory street grades.
D. Proposed street arrangements shall make provisions for
continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas; the proper
projection of streets into adjoining undeveloped or unplanned
areas; and the continuation of proposed streets to the boundaries
of the tract being subdivided.
E. New half or partial streets shall be prohibited except where
essential to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with
the other requirements and standards of these regulations and
where, in addition, satisfactory assurance for dedication of the
remaining part of the street can be obtained; a cul-de-sac shall be
constructed at the end of such half street which shall be of a
permanent nature, unless a temporary cul-de-sac is approved.
F. Names of new streets shall not duplicate existing or planned street
names, or approximate such names by the use of suffixes such as
streets, cognizance should be given to existing or planned street
names within the postal delivery district served by the local post
office. New streets shall bear the same name or number of any
continuation of alignment with an existing or planned street.
G. Insofar as possible, streets on which structures are proposed to
front shall be oriented along an east-west axis with maximum
deviations permitted up to 25°, provided that such orientations are
feasible based on soil and slope conditions and are a practical
means of providing safe and convenient access and circulation.
H. Proposed private streets (streets not offered for dedication) are
prohibited, unless they meet the design standards of these
regulations.
I. Streets in and bordering a subdivision and or land development
plan shall be coordinated with, and be of such widths and grades
and at such locations so as to accommodate prospective traffic and
facilitate fire and police protection.
§ 22-502 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-502
FWD:524
2. Street Classification. Three functional classifications of streets and
roads, as classified in the Susquehanna Township Comprehensive Plan,
Chapter Six, are established as follows:
A. Arterial. This classification includes highways which provide intracounty
or intermunicipal traffic substantial volumes. Generally,
these highways should accommodate operating speeds of 55 miles
per hour.
B. Collector. This classification is intended to include those highways
which connect minor streets to arterial highways and serve as
traffic corridors connecting residential areas with industrial,
shopping and other services. They may penetrate residential areas.
Generally, these highways will accommodate operating speeds of
35 to 45 miles per hour.
C. Minor. This classification is intended to include streets and roads
that provide direct access to abutting land and connections to
higher classes of roadways. Traffic volumes will be low and travel
distance generally short. These streets and roads should be
designed for operating speeds of 25 miles per hour or under.
D. Where a lot has more than one side of street frontage and there is a
driveway on one side, if it is necessary to determine which side of
the lot fronts for purposes of this Chapter, the lot shall be
considered to front on the street on which the driveway exists. In
all other cases, the lot shall be considered to front on the street
which the lot has the greatest frontages. If the lot frontage and
driveway are not determinative, the lot shall be considered to front
on the predominant street bordering the lot.
3. Street Width.
A. Minimum street right-of-way and cartways widths shall be required
as presented in Table 502.1.
B. Provisions for additional street width (right-of-way) including for
private streets may be required when determined to be necessary
by the Board of Commissioners in specific cases for:
(1) Public safety and convenience.
(2) Parking in commercial and industrial areas and in areas of
high-density development.
4. Cul-de-Sac or Dead-End Streets.
A. Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed as cul-de-sac
streets or designed for future access to adjoining properties.
B. Any dead-end street, for access to any adjoining property or
because of authorized phase development, shall be provided with a
temporary, all weather turn-around within the subdivision or/and

§ 22-502 FOREWORD § 22-503
FWD:531
§ 22-504. Blocks.
2. Where a subdivision and/or land development is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageways, channel or stream, there shall be provided
a drainage easement, width to be determined by the Municipal
Engineer, conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse,
drainageways, unimpeded flow of natural drainage or for the purpose of
widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting such
drainage facilities or for the purpose of installing a stormwater sewer.
Under no circumstances shall the easement be less than 25 feet and
shall extend outward from the top of bank of a channel or berm of any
basin.
3. Where a subdivision or land development involves the use of solar
access, solar sky space easements will be provided, shall be in writing,
and shall be subject to the same conveyance and instrument recording
requirements as other easements. Any such easements shall be
appurtenant; shall run with the land benefited and burdened; and shall
be defined and limited by conditions stated in the instrument of
conveyance. Instruments creating a solar sky space easement shall
include but not limited to:
A. A permanently identifiable description of the sky space above the
burdened land into which trees, buildings and/or other
obstructions as specified by the easement shall not be permitted to
encroach;
B. Any terms or conditions under which the solar sky space easement
is granted or will be terminated; and
C. Any provisions for compensation by the owner of the land
benefiting from the land benefiting from the solar sky space
easement, or compensation of the owner of the land burdened by
the solar sky space for maintaining the easement.
1. The length, width, shape, and design of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to the provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type
proposed, to the land use and/or zoning requirements of the Township,
the topography of the land being subdivided or developed, and the
requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian
circulation.
2. Blocks shall not exceed 1,600 feet in length, nor be less than 600 feet in
length. Where practical, blocks along collector or arterial streets shall
not be less than 1,000 feet in length.
3. Residential blocks shall generally be of sufficient depth to
accommodate two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots
bordering an arterial or collector street are used or, where due to the
contour of the land or the necessary layout of the subdivision, there is
insufficient depth between intersecting streets for such two tier design.
§ 22-503 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-504
FWD:532
§ 22-505. Lots.
4. Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from the elements
of design contained in this Section if the nature of the use requires
other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for employees and
customers shall be provided along with safe and convenient limited
access to the street system. Space for off-street loading shall also be
provided with limited access to the street system. Extension of streets,
railroad access rights-of-way, and utilities shall be provided as
necessary.

applicable zoning regulations of Susquehanna Township.
B. Side lot lines shall, in so far as practical, run from due north to
south where the resulting angle of incidence with the street is not
less than 30°. A variation of up to 25° east or west of the north/
south axis is permitted.
C. Where feasible, lot lines should follow municipal boundaries rather
than cross them, in order to avoid jurisdictional problems.
D. If, after subdividing, there exist remnants of land, they shall be
either:
(1) Incorporated in existing or proposed lots; or
(2) Legally dedicated to public use, if acceptable to the Township.
2. Lot Frontage.
A. All lots shall abut a public street existing or proposed, or a private
street if it meets the requirements of these regulations.
B. Double or reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where
required to provide separation of residential development from
major streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography
or orientation.
C. No residential lots shall be created which front upon a limited
access highway. Furthermore, no major subdivision and/or land
developments shall be created which front upon an arterial street.
3. Building Setbacks.
§ 22-504 FOREWORD § 22-505
FWD:533
§ 22-506. Lighting.
Lighting shall be required in subdivisions and land developments. These
lighting requirements provide appropriate standards to ensure adequate
nighttime safety and security while minimizing the spillover of light and
glare on operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians and land uses near the
light source. The Comprehensive Plan recognizes that proper lighting
design is an instrument for preserving rural character or creating a sense of
place within developments. However, it is the safety, welfare, nuisance and
hazardous aspects of lighting that form the basis of these regulations.
A. Corner lots shall have extra width as required by the Susquehanna
Township Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 27), as amended.
B. Side and rear building setbacks shall conform to the Susquehanna
Township Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 27), as amended.
C. Front building setbacks shall conform to the Susquehanna
Township Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 27), as amended.
D. Buildings shall be oriented such that their longest axis faces within
25° of true south whenever lot size, street orientation, soil and
slope conditions make this practical.
A. Requirements. Exterior lighting shall be provided in parking areas,
pedestrian sidewalks and walkways and nonresidential driveway
intersections in accordance with the following standards. Lighting used
for security purposes shall also conform to the following standards.
These regulations permit an option of providing a lower light post for
luminaries with a no-cutoff design or a higher pole, up to 60 feet, for
luminaries that totally cut off light spillover at a cutoff angle smaller
than 90°. The maximum height light post permitted shall be dependent
upon the amount of cutoff provided. Exterior lighting shall meet one of
the following standards:
(1) When the light source or luminaire has no cutoff:

(4) Exemption for Specified Uses.
(a) Because of their unique requirements for nighttime visibility
and their limited hours of operation, public and private
recreational uses such as ball diamonds, playing fields, tennis
courts and volleyball courts are exempt from the above
requirements.
(b) Outdoor public and private recreational uses specified above
shall not exceed a maximum permitted post height of 80 feet.
(c) Outdoor public and private recreational uses may exceed a
total cutoff angle of 90°, provided that the luminaire is shielded
§ 22-506 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-506
FWD:536
to prevent light and glare spillover to adjacent residential uses.
The maximum permitted illumination at the interior buffer yard
line shall not exceed two footcandles.
(d) Low-level pedestrian lighting for sidewalks should be provided
as necessary for safety. Low-level sidewalk illumination for
nonresidential uses shall be between 0.5 to 0.10 footcandles.
Low-level sidewalk illumination for residential uses shall be
between 0.2 to 0.13 footcandles.
(5) Additional requirements.
(a) Flickering or flashing lights shall not be permitted.
(b) Light sources or luminaires shall not be located within buffer
yard areas except for pedestrian walkways.
(c) The location and type of lighting required by this Section shall
be shown on the site plan submitted for development.
(d) Low-level pedestrian lighting for sidewalks should be provided
as necessary for safety. Low-level sidewalk illumination for
nonresidential uses shall be between 0.5 to 1.0 footcandles.
Low-level sidewalk illumination for residential uses shall be
between 0.2 and 0.3 footcandles.
(6) Exterior lighting, except for overhead streetlighting and warning,
emergency, or traffic signals, shall be installed in such a manner
that the light source will be sufficiently obscured to prevent glare
on public streets and walkways or into any residential area. The
installation or erection of any lighting which may be confused with
warning signals, emergency signals or traffic signals shall be
unlawful. Any lighting that produces glare shall not cause
illumination in excess of five-tenths footcandles measured at the
property line.
(a) Measurement. Lighting levels shall be measured in
footcandles. Measurement shall be taken with a direct reading
portable light meter or light-reading equipment recommended
by the Township Engineer.
(b) Method. Readings shall be taken by qualified personnel so that
the light-reading meter has been exposed long enough to
provide a constant reading. Measurements shall be made after
dark with the light sources in question on, then with the same
sources off. The difference between the two readings shall be
compared to the maximum permitted illumination at the
property line at ground level. This procedure eliminates the
effects of moonlight and other ambient light.

Part 6
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION AND
SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
§ 22-601. Statement of Findings.
The Township finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the Township and all the people of
the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation);
destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
D. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain townships to implement a
program of stormwater controls. These townships are required to
obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm
sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES).
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the Commonwealth by the
Township.

§ 22-605. Repealer.
Any ordinance or ordinance provision(s) of the Township inconsistent with
any of the provision(s) of this Chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only.
§ 22-606. Severability.
Should a court of competent jurisdiction declare any section(s) or
provision(s) of this Section invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity
of any of the remaining section(s) or provision(s) of this Chapter.
§ 22-607. Compatibility with Other Ordinance Requirements.
§ 22-608. Township Liability.
The degree of stormwater management sought by the provisions of this
Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This Chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the Township, any appointed or
elected official of the Township, the Dauphin County Conservation District
or any officer, engineer or employee thereof for any erosion, sedimentation
or flood damages or flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter
or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.
§ 22-609. Duty of Persons.
Notwithstanding any provision(s) of this Chapter, including exemptions, any
landowner or any person engaged in the alteration or development of land
which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall implement such
measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety,
I. Nursery, forest or agriculture operations.
J. Other activities, which would cause an increase in stormwater
runoff.
1. Approvals issued pursuant to this Chapter do not relieve the applicant
of the responsibility to comply with or to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable codes, rules,
statutes, or ordinances. To the extent that this Chapter imposes more
rigorous or stringent requirements for stormwater management, the
specific requirements contained in this Chapter shall be followed.
2. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to affect any of the
Township's requirements regarding stormwater matters which do not
conflict with the provisions of this Chapter, such as local stormwater
management design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type, collection
system design and details, outlet structure design, etc.). Conflicting
provisions in other Township ordinances or regulations shall be
construed to retain the requirements of this Chapter addressing State
water quality requirements.
§ 22-604 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-609
FWD:544
or other property. Such measures also shall include actions as are required
to manage the rate, volume, direction, and quality of resulting stormwater
runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health, property,
and water quality.
§ 22-610. General Requirements.
1. All regulated activities in the Township, which are not granted an
exemption under § 22-611, shall submit a drainage plan consistent with
this Chapter to the Township for review. These criteria shall apply to the
total proposed development even if development is to take place in
stages. Impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to: additional
indoor living space, decks, patios, garages, storage sheds and similar
structures, roofs, parking or driveway areas, and any new streets and
sidewalks. Any areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone
shall be assumed to be impervious. The Drainage Plan shall be
approved prior to the final approval of the regulated activity.
2. All regulated activities within the Township shall be designed,
implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes of this
Chapter, through these three elements:
A. Erosion and sediment control during the earth disturbance
activities (e.g., during construction),
B. Water quality protection measures after completion of earth
disturbance activities (e.g., post construction), including
operations and maintenance.
C. Drainage and stormwater management
3. No earth disturbance activities within the Township associated with any
regulated activities shall commence until the requirements of this
Chapter are met.
4. All BMPs used to meet the requirements of this Chapter shall be
designed, installed, operated, and maintained to conform to the State
water quality requirements, the requirements of the Clean Streams
Law and implementing regulations, and any more stringent
requirements as determined by the Township.
5. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
Chapter.
6. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the altered
property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable discharge
criteria specified in this Chapter.
§ 22-609 FOREWORD § 22-610
FWD:545
7. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter.
If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the developer must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding, or other harm will result from the
concentrated discharge.
8. Where watercourses traverse a development site, drainage easements
shall be provided conforming to the line of such watercourses. The
terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the placing of fill or
structures, and any alterations that may adversely affect the flow of
stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also, maintenance,
including mowing of vegetation within the easement may be required,
except as approved by the appropriate governing authority.
9. All natural streams, channels, swales, drainage systems and surface
water concentrations shall be maintained in their existing condition
unless an alteration is approved by the Township and all encroachment
activity shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 105 (Dam Safety
and Waterway Management) of Pa. Title 25, Environmental Protection.
Any stormwater management facility intended to meet the
requirements of this Chapter that constitutes an encroachment or
enclosure, as described in Chapter 105, will require a DEP permit.
10. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this Chapter that
will be located in or adjacent to waters of the Commonwealth (including
wetlands) shall be subject to approval by DEP under regulations at 25
Pennsylvania Code Chapter 105 through the joint permit application
process, or, where deemed appropriate by DEP, the general permit
process. When there is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it
is the responsibility of the developer or his agent to show that the land
in question cannot be classified as wetlands; otherwise, approval to
work in the area must be obtained from DEP.
A. Where no wetlands will be impacted by the proposed subdivision or
land development the applicant shall provide the certification on
the plan:
"I, (signature of consultant and date), hereby certify that there
are no wetlands on the subject property, the proposed project will
not impact off-site wetlands, and wetland permits are not required
from the state or federal government."
11. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers, or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may
constitute a dam are subject to permit by DEP under regulations at 25
Pennsylvania Code Chapter 105.
§ 22-610 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-610
FWD:546
12. All earth disturbance activities are subject to permit requirements by
DEP under regulations at 25 Pennsylvania Code Chapter 102.
13. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this Chapter that
will be located on State highway rights-of-way shall be subject to
approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
14. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff through
seepage beds, infiltration trenches, etc., are encouraged, where soil
conditions permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need for detention
facilities.
15. Developers are encouraged to incorporate designs to take advantage of
the stormwater credits presented in the Spring or Paxton Creek Act 167
Stormwater Management Plans.
16. Special Conditions for Areas Falling within Defined Exceptional Value
and High Quality Sub-Watersheds. The temperature and quality of
water and streams that have been declared as exceptional value and
high quality is to be maintained as defined in Chapter 93, Water Quality
Standards, Title 25, of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection Rules and Regulations. Temperature sensitive BMPs and
stormwater conveyance systems are to be used and designed with
storage pool areas and supply outflow channels and should be shaded
with trees. This will require modification of berms for permanent ponds
and relaxation of restrictions on planting vegetation within the
facilities, provided that the capacity for volumes and rate controls is
maintained. At a minimum, the southern half on pond shorelines will be
planted with shade or canopy trees within 10 feet of the pond shoreline.
In conjunction with this requirement, the maximum slope allowed on
the berm area to be planted is 10 to one. This will lessen the
destabilization of berm soils due to root growth. A long-term
maintenance schedule and management plan for the thermal control
BMPs is to be established and recorded for all development sites.
17. Techniques described in Appendix D42 (Low Impact Development) of
this Chapter are encouraged because they reduce the costs of
complying with the requirements of this Chapter and the State water
quality requirements.
18. Infiltration for stormwater management is encouraged where soils and
geology permit, consistent with the provisions of this Chapter and,
where appropriate, infiltration is encouraged for capturing and treating
any part of the water quality volume or for otherwise meeting the
purposes of this Chapter.
19. The Township may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative
methods for meeting the State water quality requirements other than
those in this Section, provided that they meet the minimum

requirements of, and do not conflict with, State law, including, but not
limited to, the Clean Streams Law.
20. All developments that create impervious surface or change the existing
topography, except for exemptions provided in § 22-611, shall
demonstrate that adequate capacity will be provided to contain the
ground water recharge and to treat the water quality requirements, as
described under §§ 22-617 and 22-618 of this Chapter.
21. If a regulated activity by this Chapter is to be performed by any
individual, firm, contractor or other entity other than that which
submitted the Drainage Plan, such entity shall, by signature,
acknowledge awareness of the plan requirements before the start of the
regulated activity.
22. Although there are no stormwater control methods restricted from or
required for use, the following considerations apply to the selection and
use of any method:
A. The Township may approve or disapprove those methods based on
geologic, topographic, hydrologic, soil, aesthetic, safety, health or
other considerations.
B. The following is a list of methods which may be used for
stormwater control. The choice of control method is not limited to
these methods and any method selected should be carefully suited
to the requirements of the project and the characteristics of the
site:
(1) Detention basins.
(2) Roof-top storage.
(3) Parking lot storage.
(4) Infiltration structures.
(5) Porous pavement.
(6) Grassed channels.
(7) Underground storage.
(8) Cisterns.
NOTE: For further description of those and other methods,
see the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual.
1. Two exemptions (Exemption 1, Release Rates, Water Quality Volume,
Channel Protection Volume, and Drainage Plan Submission; and
Exemption 2, Ground Water Recharge) from this Chapter may be
§ 22-610 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-611
FWD:548
granted at the discretion of the Township. The applicant must
demonstrate that the following BMPs are being utilized to the maximum
extent practicable to receive consideration for either of the two
exemptions:
A. Design around and limit disturbance of floodplains, wetlands,
natural slopes over 15%, existing native vegetation, and other
sensitive and special value features;

F. Minimize soil disturbance and reclaim disturbed areas with topsoil
and vegetation;
G. Direct runoff to pervious areas;
H. Utilize stormwater credits presented in the Spring or Paxton Creek
Act 167 Stormwater Management Plans; and
I. Utilize guidance listed in the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual.
2. Exemption 1: Release Rates, Water Quality Volume, Channel Protection
Volume, and Drainage Plan Submission. An exemption of these
requirements contained within this Chapter for all regulated activities
within the Township may be granted at the discretion of the Township in
accordance with the following:
A. An exemption of Release Rates, Water Quality Volume, Channel
Protection Volume, and Drainage Plan Submission may be granted
in accordance with Table 611.1 to determine the maximum
additional impervious area (and associated minimum separation
distance) that can be placed on a development site. This exemption
shall be granted only if the Township determines that proposed
development/additional impervious area will not adversely impact
the following:
(1) Capacities of existing drainageways and storm sewer systems;
(2) Velocities and erosion;
(3) Quality of runoff, if direct discharge is proposed;
(4) Existing known problem areas;
(5) Safe conveyance of the additional runoff; and
(6) Downstream property owners.

3. Exemption 2: Ground Water Recharge. An exemption of this
requirement for all regulated activities within the Township may be
granted at the discretion of the Township in accordance with the
following:
A. An exemption of Ground Water Recharge may be granted if the
maximum additional impervious coverage is 2,000 square feet or
less. Development sites that generate greater than 2,000 square
feet of new impervious cover are not eligible for this exemption
based on additional impervious coverage. The 2,000 square foot
maximum additional impervious cover applies to the total amount
of additional impervious cover to be placed on a development site
whether the project is a single phase or will occur in multiple
phases. It does not include existing impervious cover placed on a
development site prior to the adoption of this Chapter.
B. An exemption of Ground Water Recharge may be granted if the
Township, based upon data provided by the applicant, determines
§ 22-611 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-611
FWD:550
§ 22-612. Stormwater Management Districts.
that the Ground Water Recharge requirements are not suitable in
the following areas:
(1) High groundwater table (need minimum of three feet from bed
of infiltration facility to seasonal high groundwater elevation).
(2) Shallow depth to bedrock (need minimum of two feet from bed
of infiltration facility to top of bedrock).
(3) High risk of sinkhole development, to be determined on a caseby-
case basis.
4. At the discretion of the Township, the applicant may be required to
provide a detailed geotechnical evaluation.
5. Under no circumstance shall the applicant be exempt from
implementing such measures as necessary to:
A. Meet State water quality standards/requirements.
B. Protect health, safety, and property.
C. Meet special requirements for high quality (HQ) and exceptional
value (EV) watersheds.
1. The Township is hereby divided into stormwater management districts
in accordance with the Paxton Creek Stormwater Management Plan,
the Paxton Creek Release Rate Map, the Spring Creek Stormwater
Management Plan and the Spring Creek Release Rate Map. The official
release rate district maps are available for inspection at the Township
office. All areas within the districts are subject to the specified release
rates. The two-, ten-, and twenty-five-year design storms are all subject
to the specified release rates.
2. If the developer can show that the post-development hydrograph
matches the predevelopment hydrograph for peak flows and volume,
for all design storms, then meeting the requirements of the release
rates are not required.
3. Specific Watershed Requirements:
A. Paxton Creek Watershed: Specified Release Rate Districts. For all
districts in this category, the future runoff must be controlled to the
specified release rate. That is, the post-development runoff rate
must be less than or equal to the predevelopment rate multiplied by
the specified release rate for that district.
B. Paxton Creek Watershed: Provisional No Detention Districts. These
watershed areas may discharge post-development peak runoff
without detention facilities. However, the developer must prove
that the "local" runoff conveyance facilities which transport runoff
§ 22-611 FOREWORD § 22-612
FWD:551
from the site to the main channel have adequate capacity to safely
transport unattenuated increased peak flows for a twenty-five-year
storm in accordance with § 22-613(3). If there is inadequate
capacity, the developer shall either use 100% release rate control
or provide increased capacity of downstream drainage facilities
to convey increase peak flows consistent with § 22-613(3). When
determining if adequate capacity exists in the local watershed
drainage network, the developer must assume that the entire local
watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new
development will use the least restrictive runoff controls specified
by this Section.
C. Spring Creek Watershed: Specified Release Rate Districts. For all
districts in this category, the future runoff must be controlled to the
specified release rate. That is, the post-development runoff rate
must be less than or equal to the predevelopment rate multiplied by
the specified release rate for that district.
D. Areas Not Within the Paxton Creek or Spring Creek Watershed. For
all areas within the Township but outside the Paxton Creek or
Spring Creek Watersheds, the future peak rate of runoff for the
two-, ten- and twenty-five-year design storms must be controlled to
the existing rate.
E. The exact location of any given development site, or activity
regulated by this Chapter relative to the release rate district
boundaries shall be determined by mapping the release rate
district boundaries using two foot topographic contour mapping
provided as part of the Drainage Plan.
F. For the proposed development site located entirely within one
release rate district, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
required release rate criteria. For sites with multiple discharge
points, any individual point may be designed to a 100% release
rate, provided that the total runoff from the site is controlled to the
applicable release rate for that district.
G. For a proposed development site which is located within two or
more release rate districts, the maximum runoff discharged at any
point shall be equal to the release rate for the district in which the
discharge point is located. In the event that a portion of the site is
located in a provisional no detention area, no runoff from portions
of the site located in areas subject to release rate controls may be
drained to or through the provisional no detention area.
H. Each development site shall be considered separately and shall
conform to the criteria of the district in which it is located. In no
case may the release rate for an area be exceeded as credit for a
reduction below the criteria or any other restrictions on a separate
site.
§ 22-612 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-612
FWD:552
§ 22-613. Stormwater Management District Implementation
Provisions.
I. Regional detention facilities will be permitted, provided that
adequate conveyance is available or provided from the site to the
facility. The acceptability and discharge characteristics of the
facility will be determined on a case by case basis, by the Township
Engineer, using the calibrated model developed for the Paxton
Creek Act 167 Plan or Spring Creek Act 167 Plan, as applicable.
1. Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed
development site are not subject to release rate criteria when
determining allowable peak runoff rates. However, on-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the
development site.
2. No-Harm Option. For any proposed development site, the developer has
the option of using a less restrictive runoff control (including no
detention) if the developer can prove that no harm would be caused by
discharging at a higher runoff rate than existing conditions. The noharm
option is used when a developer can prove that the postdevelopment
hydrographs can match pre-development hydrographs, or
if it can be proven that the post-development conditions will not cause
increases in peak flows at all points downstream. Proof of no harm
would have to be shown based upon a downstream impact evaluation
which shall include a downstream hydraulic capacity analysis
consistent with § 22-613(3) to determine if adequate hydraulic capacity
exists. The developer shall submit this evaluation of the impacts due to
increased downstream stormwater flows in the watershed to the
Township.
A. The downstream impact evaluation shall include hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations necessary to determine the impact of
hydrograph timing modifications due to the proposed development
upon a dam, highway, structure, natural point of restricted stream
flow, or any stream channel section, established with the
concurrence of the Township.
B. Proof of no harm must be shown from the point of discharge
through entire downstream network to the mouth of Paxton Creek
or Spring Creek, as applicable, at the Susquehanna River. For those
areas outside of the Paxton Creek and Spring Creek Watersheds,
proof of no harm must be shown through the entire downstream
network to the ultimate discharge point at the Susquehanna River.
C. The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, ten-, and twenty-five-year) shall
be the values from the calibrated model for the Paxton Creek or
Spring Creek Watershed Act 167 Plans. These flow values can be
obtained from the watershed plan.
§ 22-612 FOREWORD § 22-613
FWD:553
D. Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would,
by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to prove no
harm, except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements
for the problem areas.
E. A financial distress shall not constitute grounds for granting a noharm
exemption.
F. Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to
implement the no-harm option, which proposes specific capacity
improvements to demonstrate that a less stringent discharge
control would not create any harm downstream.
G. Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as
documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in
proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total
upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity (i.e., if
his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage, he may use
up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity).
H. Any municipality approving a no-harm option shall notify all
downstream municipalities of such approval. The approving
municipality shall make all relevant information used to prove a noharm
option available upon request to any municipality with the
Paxton Creek Watershed and the Spring Creek Watershed.
I. Any no-harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the Drainage Plan submission. The burden of proof shall
rest on the developer.
3. Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis. Any downstream capacity
hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this Chapter shall use
the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased
peak flow rates:
A. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a twenty-five-year return
period event within their banks at velocities consistent with
protection of the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall
be based upon criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual.
B. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
C. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers, or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP, Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable), and,
at a minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff, except for facilities located within a designated floodplain

FWD:554
§ 22-614. Calculation Methodology.
area which must, at a minimum, conform to FEMA and local
floodplain ordinance requirements.
4. Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the
watershed, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility
for more than one development site than to provide an individual
control facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for
any regional runoff control alternatives is the responsibility of
prospective developer(s). The design of any regional control basins
must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream
watershed. The peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined
on a case-by-case basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed
consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas.
"Hydrologic model" refers to the calibrated model as developed for the
Paxton Creek Stormwater Management Plan.
5. Capacity improvements may be provided as necessary to permit direct
discharge in a provisional no detention district, to implement any
regional or subregional detention alternatives, or to implement a noharm
option which proposes specific capacity improvements to
document the validity of less stringent discharge control which would
not create any harm downstream.
1. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or a Soil-Cover-Complex methodology.
A. Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas
greater than 20 acres, including on- and off-site areas, shall use a
generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the
NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method. Table 614.1 summarizes
acceptable computation methods. It is assumed that all methods
will be selected by the design professional based on the individual
limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site.
B. The Township may approve the use of the Modified Rational
Method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that
contain less than 20 acres. However, the Modified Rational Method
may not be used to compute the volume of stormwater runoff.
C. The Township may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that
produces a full hydrograph.
D. All calculations consistent with this Chapter using the Soil Cover
Complex Method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths
for the various return period storms presented in Table A-1 in
Appendix A43 of this Chapter. If a hydrologic computer model is
used for stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of
§ 22-613 FOREWORD § 22-614
FWD:555
rainfall shall be 24 hours along with a Soil Conservation Service
Type II rainfall distribution.
E. For the purpose of predevelopment flow rate determination,
undeveloped land shall be considered as "meadow" good condition,
or "range" unless the natural ground cover generates a lower
Rational "C" value or curve number (i.e. forest).
F. For the purpose of post-development flow rate determination, the
proposed ground cover shall be used to determine the Rational "C"
value or curve number.
G. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for
overland flow and return periods from the Intensity Duration
Frequency (IDF) Curves from the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, latest version.
H. Times of concentration for overland flow may be calculated using
the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from
time to time by NRCS), for developed sites. Times of concentration
for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using the Manning
equation.
(1) The length of the flow path for sheet flow shall not exceed 150
feet and the length of the flow path for shallow concentrated
flow shall not exceed 1,000 feet.
I. Times of concentration for undeveloped sites may also be
computed using the SCS equation for lag time:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6) * 60] (minutes)
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet)
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent)
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by:
S = [(1,000/CN) - 10]
CN = SCS curve number for watershed as defined by
the SCS Loss Method

§ 22-614 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-614
FWD:556
J. Runoff coefficients (C) for both existing and proposed conditions
for use in the Rational Method shall be obtained from Table A-3 in
Appendix A of this Chapter.
K. Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed
conditions to be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be
obtained from Table A-2 in Appendix A of this Chapter.
L. Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be
used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of
open channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning
roughness coefficient "n" shall be consistent with Table A-4 in
Appendix A of this Chapter. Manning equation should not be used
for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of culverts.
M. The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet
the performance standards of this Chapter shall be verified by
routing the future two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year
hydrographs through these facilities using the Storage-Indication
Method or Modified Puls Method. For drainage areas greater than
20 acres in size, the design storm hydrograph shall be computed
using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph.
N. The Township has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations and conditions
and site history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual
physical calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of
concentration values should be utilized at a particular site, then
appropriate variations may be made upon review and
recommendation of the Township.
O. Principal outlet structures for stormwater management facilities
shall be designed to meet the performance standards of this
Chapter using any generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique
or method.

1. No earth disturbance activities within the Township shall commence
until approval by the Dauphin County Conservation District of an
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan for construction activities.
2. When 5,000 square feet or more of earth disturbance activities are
proposed, an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan must be
submitted to the Dauphin County Conservation District and the
Township in accordance with 25 Pennsylvania Code § 102.4(b). In
addition, a letter from the Dauphin County Conservation District
approving the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan must be
obtained.
3. DEP has regulations, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, that a DEP NPDES
Construction activities permit is required and must be obtained from
the Dauphin County Conservation District and or DEP for earth
disturbance activities.
4. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for earth disturbance activities
from the Southcentral Regional DEP office or Dauphin County
Conservation District must be provided to the Township.
5. A copy for the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
6. Design Criteria for Erosion Control Facilities. All erosion control
facilities shall be designed at a minimum to meet the design standards
and specifications of the latest revision of the Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual, published by DEP. Grassed
§ 22-614 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-615
FWD:558
waterways allow recharge of groundwater. The usage of grassed
waterways is not recommended in areas of year-round or seasonally
high groundwater tables unless provision is made to handle long
duration flows, for example by means of subsurface drainage or stone
centered waterways.
7. Construction Standards for Erosion Control Facilities. Construction
standards for erosion control facilities shall be in accordance with the
approved plans and accompanying specifications. The construction
standards for erosion control facilities outlined in the latest revision of
the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual published
by DEP shall be considered the minimal acceptable standard. Controls
shall be installed at initial stages of earthmoving and otherwise as
outlined in the staging of earthmoving activities section of the soil
erosion and sediment control plan.
8. Maintenance Criteria for Erosion Control Practices. Maintenance is an
essential part of the successful functioning of an erosion control
system.
A. Maintenance during development of a project shall be the
responsibility of the developer and/or landowner and shall usually
include, but not be limited to:
(1) Removal of silt from all debris basins, traps or other structures
or measures when capacity of those structures is reached. (See
DEP's Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program
Manual, current edition.).
(2) Periodic maintenance of temporary control facilities such as
replacement of straw bale dikes, straw filters or similar
measures.
(3) Establishment or reestablishment of vegetation by seeding and
mulching or sodding of scoured areas or areas where
vegetation has not successfully been established.
(4) Installation of necessary controls to correct unforeseen
problems caused by storm events within design frequencies.
(5) The contractor or developer shall be responsible for removal of
all temporary measures and installation of permanent
measures upon completion of the project.
B. After dedication of facilities to the Township, except in cases where
agreements to the contrary have been previously executed,
maintenance shall be the responsibility of the Township and shall
include:
(1) Mowing to maintain adequate stands of grass and to control
weeds. Chemical weed control may be used if State and local
§ 22-615 FOREWORD § 22-615
FWD:559
§ 22-616. Water Quality Requirements after Regulated Earth
Disturbance.
regulations are met. Selection of seed mixtures should reflect
the type of maintenance desired by the Township.
(2) Removal of silt from all permanent structures which trap silt or
sediment is essential to keep this material from building up in
grassed waterways and reducing their capacity.
(3) It shall be the responsibility of the Township to inspect all
permanent facilities and to see that corrective action is taken
where necessary.
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the Township shall
commence until approval by the Township of a plan which demonstrates
compliance with State water quality requirements after construction is
complete.
2. The BMPs must be designed, implemented, and maintained to meet
State water quality requirements, and any other more stringent
requirements as determined by the Township.
3. To control post-construction stormwater impacts from earth
disturbance activities, State water quality requirements can be met by
a variety of BMPs, including site design, which provide for replication of
pre-construction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, so that
post-construction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. As
described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(#392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
A. Groundwater Recharge/Infiltration: replication of pre-construction
stormwater infiltration conditions;
B. Water Quality Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to
ensure filtering out of the chemical and physical pollutants from
the stormwater runoff; and
C. Stream Bank and Streambed Protection: management of volume
and rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
4. DEP has regulations that require the Township to ensure design,
implementation, and maintenance of BMPs that control runoff from new
development and redevelopment after earth disturbance activities are
complete. These requirements include the need to implement postconstruction
stormwater BMPs with assurance of long-term operations
and maintenance of those BMPs.
§ 22-615 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-617
FWD:560
§ 22-617. Groundwater Recharge Volume (Infiltration/Recharge/
Retention).
1. The ability to retain and maximize the ground water recharge capacity
of the area being developed or redeveloped is encouraged. Design of
the infiltration/recharge stormwater management facilities shall give
consideration to providing ground water recharge to compensate for
the reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is
paved and roofed over. These measures are encouraged, particularly in
hydrologic soil groups A and B and shall be utilized wherever feasible.
2. The annual recharge volume requirement shall be specified for a site as
follows:
A. Percent Volume Method
Rev = [(S)(Rv)(A)] / 12
Where:
Rev = Groundwater Recharge Volume (ac-ft)
S = Soil Specific Recharge Factor
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I)
I = Percent Impervious Cover (i.e., use I = 20 when
there is 20% impervious cover)
A = Site area (acres)
B. Percent Area Method
Rev=(S)(Ai)
Where:
Rev = Groundwater Recharge Volume (ac-ft)
S = Soil Specific Recharge Factor
Ai = Measured impervious cover (acres)
Hydrologic Soil Group
Soil Specific Recharge Factor
(S)
A 0.39
B 0.26
C 0.14
D 0.07
C. The recharge volume is considered part of the total water quality
volume WQv that must be provided at a site and can be achieved
either by a structural practice (e.g., infiltration, bioretention), a
nonstructural practice (e.g., buffers, disconnection of rooftops), or
a combination of both.
§ 22-617 FOREWORD § 22-617
FWD:561
D. Drainage areas having no impervious cover and no proposed
disturbance during development may be excluded from the Rev
calculations. Designers are encouraged to use these areas as
nonstructural practices for Rev treatment.
E. Note: Rev and WQv are inclusive. When treated separately, the Rev
may be subtracted from the WQv when sizing the water quality
BMP.
3. Basis for Determining Recharge Volume.
A. Developers are encouraged to incorporate designs to take
advantage of the stormwater credits presented in the Spring or
Paxton Creek Act 167 Stormwater Management Plans.
B. If more than one HSG is present at a site, a composite soil-specific
recharge factor shall be computed based on the proportion of total
site area within each HSG. The recharge volume provided at the
site shall be directed to the most permeable HSG available.
C. The "Percent Volume" method is used to determine the Rev
treatment requirement when structural practices are used to
provide recharge. These practices must provide seepage into the
ground and may include infiltration and exfiltration structures
(e.g., infiltration, bioretention, dry swales or sand filters with
storage below the under drain). Structures that require
impermeable liners, intercept groundwater, or are designed for
trapping sediment (e.g., forbays) may not be used. In this method,
the volume of runoff treated by structural practices shall meet or
exceed the computed recharge volume.
D. The "Percent Area" method is used to determine the Rev treatment
requirements when nonstructural practices are used. Under this
method, the recharge requirements are evaluated by mapping the
percent of impervious area that is effectively treated by an
acceptable nonstructural practice and comparing it to the
minimum recharge requirements.
E. Acceptable nonstructural practices include filter strips that treat
rooftop or parking lot runoff, sheet flow discharge to stream
buffers, and grass channels that treat roadway runoff.
F. The recharge volume criterion does not apply to any portion of a
site designated as a stormwater hotspot or any project considered
as redevelopment. In addition, the Township Board of
Commissioners may alter or eliminate the recharge volume
requirement if the site is situated on unsuitable soils (e.g., marine
clays, karst, or in an urban redevelopment area). In this situation,
nonstructural practices (Percent Area Method) shall be
implemented to the maximum extent practicable and the remaining
or untreated Rev included in the WQv treatment.
§ 22-617 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-617
FWD:562
G. Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, as to
maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
H. If Rev is treated by structural or non-structural practices separate
and upstream of the WQv treatment, the WQv is adjusted
accordingly.
4. Soils Evaluation.
A. A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation shall
be performed by a qualified professional, and at a minimum,
address soil permeability, depth of bedrock, susceptibility to
sinkhole formation, and subgrade stability, hydrologic soil groups
and natural and man-made features.
(1) Soil percolation or infiltration rates must be based on actual
field tests and may not be assumed from data contained within
the Dauphin County Soils Survey.
B. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in
geologically susceptible areas such as strip mine or limestone
areas. Extreme caution shall also be exercised where salt or
chloride would be pollutant since soils do little to filter this
pollutant and it may contaminate the groundwater. It is also
extremely important that the design professional evaluate the
possibility of groundwater contamination from the proposed
infiltration/recharge facility and recommend a hydrogeologic
justification study be performed if necessary. Whenever a basin will
be located in an area underlain by limestone, a geological
evaluation of the proposed location shall be conducted to
determine susceptibility to sinkhole formations. The design of all
facilities over limestone formations shall include measures to
prevent groundwater contamination and, where necessary,
sinkhole formation.
C. The Township may require the installation of an impermeable liner
in detention basins. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be
required by the Township. The Township may require the developer
to provide safeguards against groundwater contamination for uses
which may cause groundwater contamination, should there be a
mishap or spill.
D. It shall be the developer's responsibility to verify if the site is
underlain by limestone. The following note shall be attached to all
Drainage Plans and signed and sealed by the developer's engineer/
surveyor/landscape architect/geologist: "I, ____________________,
certify that the proposed detention basin (circle one) is/is not
underlain by limestone."
§ 22-617 FOREWORD § 22-617
FWD:563
§ 22-618. Water Quality Volume Requirements.
E. Where pervious pavement is permitted for parking lots,
recreational facilities, non-dedicated streets, or other areas,
pavement construction specifications shall be noted on the plan.
F. Recharge/infiltration facilities may be used in conjunction with
other innovative or traditional BMPs, stormwater control facilities,
and nonstructural stormwater management alternatives.
G. All recharge/infiltration facilities shall be designed to completely
drain within 72 hours from the end of the storm.
H. Infiltration structures shall be designed for required storm volume
based on field-determined capacity at the elevation of the proposed
infiltration surface.
1. In addition to the general standards and design criteria requirements of
this Chapter, the land developer shall comply with the following water
quality requirements unless otherwise exempted by provisions of this
Chapter.
A. The size of the water quality facility shall be based upon the
following equation:
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)] / 12
Where:
WQv = Water Quality Volume (ac-ft)
P = 1.1 inches of rainfall
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I)
I = Percent Impervious Cover (i.e., use I = 20 when
there is 20% impervious cover)
A = Site Area (acres)
B. Treatment of the WQv shall be provided at all developments where
stormwater management is required. A minimum WQv of 0.2 acreinches
shall be met at sites or in drainage areas that have less than
15% imperious cover.
C. Drainage areas having no impervious cover and no proposed
disturbance during development may be excluded from the WQv
calculations. Designers are encouraged to maximize the use of
these areas as nonstructural practices for WQv treatment.
D. The design of the facility shall consider and minimize the chances
of clogging and sedimentation potential. Orifices smaller than
three inches diameter are not recommended. However, if the
design engineer can provide proof that the smaller orifices are
protected from clogging by use of trash racks, etc., smaller orifices
may be permitted.
§ 22-617 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-618
FWD:564
§ 22-619. Stream Bank Protection Requirements.
E. Developers are encouraged to incorporate designs to take
advantage of the stormwater credits presented in the Spring or
Paxton Creek Act 167 Stormwater Management Plans.
F. To comply with the requirements of § 22-618, the developer may
submit original and innovative designs to the Township for review
and approval. Such designs may achieve the water quality
objectives through a combination of BMPs.
G. In selecting the appropriate BMPs or combinations thereof, the
developer shall consider the following:
(1) Total contributing area;
(2) Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils;
(3) Slope and depth to bedrock;
(4) Seasonal high water table;
(5) Proximity to building foundations and wellheads;
(6) Erodibility of soils; and
(7) Land availability and configuration of the topography.
H. The following additional factors should be considered when
evaluating the suitability of BMPs used in control water quality at a
given development site:
(1) Peak discharge and required volume control;
(2) Stream bank erosion;
(3) Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality
problems;
(4) The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated;
(5) The nature of the pollutant being removed; and
(6) Maintenance requirements.
1. Stream bank protection, including riparian buffer, shall be considered
in implementing performance standards. If a stormwater storage
facility needs to be constructed then, to protect channels from erosion,
the outflow structure shall be designed to provide the twenty-four-hour
extended detention of the one-year twenty-four-hour storm event. The
method for determining the Channel Protection Storage Volume (Cpv)
requirement is detailed in Appendix C44 of this Chapter.
44.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this Chapter.
§ 22-618 FOREWORD § 22-619
FWD:565
§ 22-620. Design Standards for Stormwater Management and
Conveyance Facilities.
2. Basis for Determining Channel Protection Storage Volume, Cpv:
A. The models HEC-HMS, TR-55 and TR-20 (or an equivalent
approved by the Township) shall be used for determining peak
discharge rates.
B. Rainfall depth for the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm event in
Dauphin County is 2.5 inches.
C. Off-site areas shall be modeled as present land use in good
condition for the one-year storm event.
D. The Cpv is not required at sites where the one-year postdevelopment
peak discharge (qi) is less than or equal to 2.0 cfs. A
Cpv office diameter (do) of less than three inches is subject to
approval by the Township and is not recommended unless an
internal control for orifice protection is used.
E. Cpv shall be addressed for the entire site. If a site consists of
multiple drainage areas, Cpv may be distributed proportionately to
each drainage area.
F. Extended detention storage provided for the Cpv does not meet the
WQv requirement (i.e., Cpv and WQv shall be treated separately).
G. The stormwater storage needed for the Cpv may be provided above
the WQv storage in stormwater ponds and wetlands thereby
meeting all storage criteria except Rev in a single facility with
appropriate hydraulic control structures for each storage
requirement.
H. Infiltration is not recommended for Cpv control because of large
storage requirements.
1. The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval of the
affected landowners.
2. Stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall not be diverted so as
to overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public
lands, without approved provisions being made by the applicant for
properly handling such conditions.
3. Where a watercourse runs across or through a subdivision, a drainage
easement, which conforms with the line of such watercourse shall be
provided.
4. Storm drainage facilities, as required, shall be placed in front of the
curb line when located in a street right-of-way. When located in
§ 22-619 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-620
FWD:566
undedicated land, they shall be placed within an easement, as approved
by the Township, who may require additional width of easement as
circumstances warrant.
5. Retention/Detention Basin Criteria:
A. Where a stormwater detention basin is proposed, the plan shall
include a proposal to prevent such basin from becoming a safety
hazard or public nuisance and for regular perpetual maintenance of
the basin to insure its continuous effectiveness.
B. All controls designed to meet the requirements of this Chapter
shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for the two-, ten- and
twenty-five-year return period storms.
C. Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen
embankment, required or regulated by this Chapter, shall be
designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow up to and
including the one-hundred-year post-development conditions. The
height of embankment must be set as to provide a minimum onefoot
of freeboard above the maximum pool elevation computed
when the facility functions for the one-hundred-year postdevelopment
inflow. Soils used for the construction of basins shall
have low-erodibility factors ("K" factors). Any facility that
constitutes a dam, as defined in DEP Chapter 105 regulations, may
require a permit under dam safety regulations.
D. Any facilities that constitute water obstructions (e.g., culverts,
bridges, outfalls, or stream enclosures) and any work involving
wetlands as directed in DEP Chapter 105 regulations (as amended
or replaced from time to time by DEP) shall be designed in
accordance with Chapter 105 and will require a permit from DEP.
Any water obstruction that does not fall under Chapter 105
regulations must be able to convey, without damage to the drainage
structure or roadway, runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm
with a minimum one-foot of freeboard measured below the lowest
point along the top of the roadway.
E. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall
incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The
Township shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that
would result in the occupancy or continuation of an adverse
hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed.
F. Basins which are not designed to release all stormwater shall be
specifically identified as retention basins or permanent pond
basins. All other basins shall have provisions for dewatering,
particularly the bottom, and shall not create swampy and/or
unmaintainable conditions. Sod-lined or stone lowflow channels
may be used to dewater the bottom of a basin. The minimum slope
of any surface on the bottom of the pond shall be 1.5%.
§ 22-620 FOREWORD § 22-620
FWD:567
G. Retention basins and/or detention basins which are designed with
earth fill embankments shall incorporate the following standards:
(1) The minimum top width of embankments up to eight feet in
height shall be equal to 2/3 of the embankment height, but in
no case shall the top width be less than five feet.
(2) The side slopes of the earth fill shall not be less than three
horizontal to one vertical.
(3) A cut off trench and key trench of impervious material shall be
provided under all embankments exceeding four feet in height.
(4) All pipes and culverts through embankments shall be fitted
with properly spaced and sized cut off collars.
(5) No outlet structure from a detention basin or swale shall
discharge directly onto a Township or State road, but may
discharge into a culvert under a Township or State road.
(6) Any basin may be required to be fenced with a minimum of
four-foot-high fence of a material acceptable to the Township.
Gates shall be provided where required. The Board of
Commissions shall make the decision to require fencing based
on potential hazards at the site such as detention versus
retention capability, slope, depth of water and length of
detention time.
(7) All facilities shall have access roads and easements where
necessary.
6. General Requirements for Stormwater Collection.
A. The design criteria for storm sewers and man-made channels (i.e.,
swales) shall be the ten-year frequency storm, unless more
restrictive frequencies are required by Chapter 105 of the
Department of Environmental Protection regulations, with
intensities based on the times of concentration for PennDOT
Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) curves, and runoff coefficients
based on land use for each drainage area. A minimum time of
concentration of five minutes shall be used. Computation methods
shall be based on the Rational Method or Soil Cover Complex
Method. The Township, pursuant of recommendations of the
Township Engineer, may require a design storm of higher intensity
be used when on site or surrounding conditions, such as history of
flooding downstream or the capacity of the receiving stream or
stormwater system indicate such a variation to be necessary.
B. Storm drainage systems shall be provided to allow unimpeded flow
of natural watercourses except as modified by stormwater
detention facilities or open channels consistent with this Section.
§ 22-620 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-620
FWD:568
C. Storm drainage facilities and appurtenances shall be so designed
and constructed as to minimize erosion at discharge points and in
watercourse channels. Adequate erosion protection shall be
provided along all open channels and at all points of discharge.
D. When connecting to an existing storm sewer system, the applicant
must demonstrate that the proposed system will not exacerbate
any existing stormwater problems.
E. Pipe Design.
(1) Pipes shall be designed so as to provide a minimum velocity of
2 1/2 feet per second when flowing full.
(2) At a minimum, pipe capacities shall be computed using both
the Manning Equation for full flow capacity and the Inlet
Control Nomographs in Hydraulic Design Series 5 by the
Federal Highway Administration, dated September 1985. For
inlets, the maximum headwater elevation must be less than the

outcroppings and scenic views.
§ 22-1001. Tree Preservation and Planting and Woodland
Preservation.
1. Trees, with a caliper of six inches or more and measured at a height of
4 1/2 feet above existing grade, shall not be removed unless they are
located within the proposed cartways or sidewalk portion of the street
right-of-way, or within 15 feet of the foundation area of a proposed
building. In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level
shall be maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb the trees.
2. Where existing trees are removed along the street right-of-way,
supplemental planting, in the form of appropriate street trees, shall be
introduced. Such trees shall be planted at intervals of between 50 feet
and 100 feet, preferably in random patterns and shall be approved by
the Township's Shade Tree Commission.
3. When deemed necessary by the Township's Planning Commission, a
landscape plan will be developed for a subdivision and/or land
development. Such plan shall indicate the vegetation or plant cover
which exists and, on the same or separate sheet, the vegetation or plant
cover which will exist when landscaping is completed. In addition,
landscaping shall be designed, installed, and maintained with the aim of
allowing as great a portion of the site to remain or become wooded
without adversely affecting the availability of solar access to the south.
4. The location of species of trees and other landscaping elements shall be
such that when grown to full maturity shall not impede solar access to
neighboring structures.
5. In designing a subdivision and land development plan for tracts with
woodlands the applicant shall be guided by the following standards.

streams, swales, stone fences and hedgerows. Such lines and the
native vegetation associated with them shall be preserved as
buffers between adjacent properties and between areas being
subdivided within a property. Preservation shall include ground,
shrub, understory and canopy vegetation.
C. Disturbance or removal of woodlands occupying environmentally
sensitive areas shall be undertaken only when approved by the
Board of Commissioners and on a limited, selective basis to
minimize the adverse impacts of such actions. This shall include
but not necessarily be limited to, vegetation performing important
soil stabilizing functions on wet soils, stream banks and sloping
lands.
D. No clearing or earth disturbance shall be permitted on a site before
the completion of subdivision and land development agreements.
The determination of sight distance clearances along roadways
shall be made graphically and not by clearing on-site prior to final
plan approval.
1. Maintenance easement for the Township or its designee, with a
minimum width of 25 feet, shall be provided along all stream and river
banks and lake edges. Such easement, in all cases, shall be of sufficient
width to provide proper maintenance.
2. Lake, stream, and river frontage shall be preserved as open space
whenever possible.
3. Access shall be provided to the water and maintenance easement area.
The width of such access points shall not be less than 50 feet.
A. All grading and earthmoving on slopes exceeding 15% shall be
minimized.
B. No site disturbance shall be allowed on slopes exceeding 25% except
grading for a portion of a driveway accessing a single-family dwelling
when it can be demonstrated that no other routing which avoids slopes
exceeding 25% is feasible.

FWD:586
§ 22-1005. Trails.
C. On slopes of 15% to 25%, the only permitted grading beyond the terms
described above, shall be in conjunction with the siting of a singlefamily
dwelling, its access driveway and the septic system, if required
(which should typically be designed with a long, narrow drainage field
following the land contours).
D. Grading or earthmoving on all sloping lands of 15% or greater shall not
result in earth cuts or fills whose highest vertical dimension exceeds six
feet, except where in the judgment of the Board of Commissioners no
reasonable alternatives exist for construction of roads, drainage
structures and other public improvements, in which case such vertical
dimensions shall not exceed 12 feet. Roads and driveways shall follow
the line of existing topography to minimize the required cut and fill.
Finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall be as required to minimize
disturbance of natural grades.
1. When a subdivision or land development proposal is traversed by or
abuts an existing trail customarily used by pedestrians and/or
equestrians, the Board of Commissioners may require the applicant to
make provisions for continued recreational use of the trail.
2. The applicant may alter the course of the trail within the tract for which
development is proposed under the following conditions:
A. The points at which the trail enters and exists the tract remain
unchanged.

payment of fees-in-lieu thereof, the private reservation of land for
recreational purposes, the dedication of land located in other areas of
the Township, or a combination of the above.
9. Time for Contribution/Dedication. The dedication for land or
contribution of funds in lieu of dedication required herein shall occur by
transferable deed or payment of funds prior to the recording of the final
land development plan or preliminary/final subdivision plan for the
phase in which the contribution or dedication is required. Where land to
be dedicated is in a phase later than the phase of the final land
development plan or preliminary/final land development plan be
recorded but is required due to the development shown on a plan to be
recorded, the Township may require bonding in an amount determined
by the Township Engineer to be 110% of the value of the land required
to be contributed to the plan to be recorded. Where privately developed
recreation facility is to be developed in a later phase, the Township may
require bonding in an amount to be determined by the Township
Engineer to be 110% of the value of the privately owned recreation land

shall include the following:
of lots on the side to be developed and in frontage on the side to be
developed between the closest intersecting streets has been developed
without sidewalks and where there are no sidewalks on the lots on
either side of the lot to be developed.
I. Notwithstanding whether a land development plan may be required or
not, the developer of one or more building on a public street or a private
street shall be required, at the time of construction, to install sidewalks
on both sides of the street in accordance with Township specifications.
A. An explanation as to why the sidewalk is not needed, which explanation
should include a delineation of any existing sidewalk or other
pedestrian path within 1/3 of a mile, to which a sidewalk could provide
conductivity to the subject parcel.
B. A review of the current and anticipated pedestrian traffic in the area.
The pedestrian traffic reviewed should include increased traffic after
the project which seeks the waiver is constructed or in anticipation of
any other pending or approved development.

area, describe existing roadways and intersections (geometrics and
traffic signal control) as well as improvements proposed by government
agencies. Describe the proposed internal transportation system for this
development including ingress and egress locations, existing or
proposed internal roadways, parking conditions, traffic channelization
and any other traffic control devices within the site.
C. Existing Traffic Conditions. This section describes the existing traffic
conditions analysis to be completed for the roadways and intersections
in the study area.
(1) Provide daily and peak hour(s) traffic volumes for roadways within
the study area. Turning movement and mainline volumes are to be
presented for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours and any site generated
peak hours. Traffic volumes should be based on actual counts
conducted within the prior two years.
(2) Utilizing methodology described in the Highway Capacity Manual,
current edition, include a volume/capacity analysis of the existing
volumes during the peak hours for all roadways and intersections.
Levels of service (A through F) are to be computed and presented
for key traffic movements, including turning movements. Traffic
signal warrant analysis shall be conducted for all unsignalized
intersections in accordance with PennDOT Publication 201. Gap
studies and queue length analysis shall also be completed for the
key intersections. The analysis of the existing road network will be
based on the current geometric condition and traffic condition.
D. Analysis of Future Conditions Without Development. The analysis of the
future conditions without the proposed development will document the
adequacy of the study area network to accommodate the traffic in the
design year(s) without the proposed development. This analysis must
include a full consideration of all committed roadway improvements to
the study area network. Clearly indicate the method and assumptions
used to forecast future traffic volumes. Perform volume/capacity and
associated analyses.
E. Trip Generation. The study shall include an estimate of the number of
trips expected to be generated by the use during the a.m., p.m. and sitegenerated
peak hours. Such estimates shall be based on the latest
published estimates of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, unless
the applicant provides the Township with estimates and supporting
documentation based upon actual counts at similar developments.
These generated volumes shall be distributed to the study area and
assigned to the existing roadway at key intersections throughout the
study area.
§ 22-1305 SUSQUEHANNA CODE § 22-1305
FWD:616
F. Analysis of Future Conditions With Development. Perform a volume/
capacity analysis for the appropriate peak hours for future conditions
with the site development as proposed. As a result of the volume/
capacity analysis, compute and describe the level of service on the
study area roadway system. Final design must address both traffic flow
and traffic safety considerations to provide safe operational
characteristics.
G. Recommended Improvements. Detail necessary improvements to the
study area roadway network which will provide for a level of service for
the design year(s) with the development which is at least equivalent to
the projected level of service for the design year(s) without the
proposed development. Describe the location, nature and extent of
proposed improvements to assure sufficient roadway capacity. Perform
volume/capacity analysis, which demonstrates the anticipated results of
making these improvements. As a result of the revised volume/capacity
analysis presented in the previous section, present levels of service for
the highway system with improvements. For each recommended
improvement, provide a preliminary cost estimate, source of funding,
and the implementation schedule for the improvement. Where new
intersections are being established to serve as access to the proposed
development, these intersections must be designed to at least operate
at Level of Service D or better.
H. Final Report. A final report must be prepared to document the results of
the traffic study and the recommended improvements to accommodate
the projected traffic due to the proposed development. Provide an
executive summary, which provides a concise description of the study
area, result of the traffic analysis and any recommended improvements.

percentage is approved by the Board of Commissioners in its discretion.
Provided the landowner has not defaulted with regard to or violated any
of the conditions of the preliminary plan approval, including compliance
with landowner's aforesaid schedule of submission of final plans for the
various sections, then the aforesaid protections afforded by
substantially completing the improvements depicted upon the final plan

initial section, in which the required improvements have not been
substantially completed within said five-year period the aforesaid
protections shall apply for an additional term or terms of three years
from the date of final plan approval for each section.

§ 24-205. Income Tax Officer. [Ord. 04-17, 12/9/2004, § 5]
This Municipality designates the Bureau as its Income Tax Officer to
perform all the duties, be subject to all the requirements, and have all
the powers prescribed by Section 13 (V) of the Enabling Act. The Bureau
shall receive such compensation for its services as it and the Municipality
agree from time to time. The Municipality expressly authorizes the Bureau

1. Suits for collection of tax are authorized, and interest and penalties
imposed, as provided in Section 13 (VII) and (VIII) of the Enabling Act.
2. Notwithstanding prior mention in this Part of specific subsections of
Section 13 of the Enabling Act, all provisions of the entire Section 13 of
the Enabling Act are incorporated into this Part by this reference, as
required by the Enabling Act. Any provisions which any future
supplements to or amendments of the Enabling Act may require to be
included in or construed to be a part of any tax on earned income or net
profits, or of the ordinance levying the same, shall automatically
become a part of this Part upon the effective date of such supplement or
amendment, without the need for formal amendment of this Part, to the
maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa C.S.A. § 1937.
1. Employeee's Unreimbursed Business Expenses. Business expenses are
as set forth in the regulations.
2. Losses. Losses are as set forth in the regulations.
3. Persons Under 16 Years of Age. This School Board finds (1) that minors
of various age groups have traditionally, and with judicial sanction,
been considered as comprising separate classes for many legislative
purposes, and (2) that minors under the age of 16 years are for the most
part unemancipated and subject to compulsory school attendance and
child labor laws, and therefore for the most part so lacking in power to
earn and to have legal control of money or property that enforcement of
reporting and collection of tax hereunder against them would yield
inconsequential amounts and would be unduly difficult, expensive, and
not in the public interest. Therefore, persons under the age of 16 years
are exempted from all liability for tax under this Part.

The provisions of this Part, so far as they are the same as ordinances in
force immediately prior to the enactment of this Part, are intended as a
continuation of such ordinance and not as a new enactment. In the event
that this Part is declared invalid, any prior ordinance of the Municipality
levying an earned income and net profits tax shall remain in full force and
effect and shall not be affected in any manner by enactment of this Part.
The provisions of this Part shall not affect any act done or liability incurred,
nor shall they affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to
enforce any right or penalty or to punish any offense under the authority of
any ordinance in effect prior to the enactment of this Part. Subject to the
foregoing provisions of this Section, effective January 1, 2005, this Part shall
supersede and repeal ordinances levying an earned income and net profits
tax in force immediately prior to the effective date of this Part.

Collection Agreement is approved as executed. The officers are authorized
to take any actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the terms of this
Part and the Tax Collection Agreement.
1. The tax levied by this Part imposes the same tax without substantial
change as imposed by this Municipality in previous years and shall be
so interpreted.
2. This Part shall not apply to any person or property as to whom or which
it is beyond the legal power of this Municipality to impose any tax or
duty herein provided for.
3. If any section, clause, sentence, or part of this Part is for any reason
judicially determined to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
determination shall not affect or impair any of the remaining sections,
clauses, sentences or parts hereof; and it is declared to be the intent of
the Board of School Directors of the Municipality that this Part would

person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits

officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year

tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise

the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the
calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are

new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The exemption
certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political

calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that

from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B, the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder
of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person,
for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification under
Subsection B, a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not
withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the
person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll amount due for
that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll
period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall

subsection is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due, and

whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.

levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the

collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.

§ 27-2102. Forestry Operations.
To encourage maintenance and management of forested or wooded open
space and promote the conduct of forestry as a sound and economically
viable use of forested land and forestry activities, including, but not limited
to timber harvesting, and to be in compliance with the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, forestry shall be a permitted use
by right in all zoning districts. The following standards apply to all timber
harvesting within the Township where the value of trees, logs, or other
timber products removed exceed $1,000. These provisions do not apply
to the cutting of trees for the personal use of the landowner or for precommercial
timber stand improvement.

§ 27-2613. Special Exceptions.
Where the Board of Commissioners, in this Chapter, has stated special
exceptions to be granted or denied by the board pursuant to express
standards and criteria, the board shall hear and decide requests for such
special exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria below:
1. The board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the
provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The board may by rule prescribe the form of application and
may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The board
may grant a variance, provided that all of the following findings are
made where relevant in a given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and, that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter in
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this Chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
2. In granting any variance, the board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this Chapter and the Pennsylvania MPC, Act of 1968, P.L.
805, No. 247 as reenacted and amended.
1. The location of the use, including with respect to the existing or future
streets giving access to it, is in harmony with the orderly and
appropriate development for the district in which the use is to be
located.

Pennsylvania MPC, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247 as reenacted and
amended, procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption of a land use ordinance; or from the determination
of the Zoning Officer, including, but not limited to, the granting or denial
of any permit, or failure to act on the application therefor the issuance of
any cease and desist order or the registration or refusal to register any
nonconforming use, structure or lot; from a determination by the Township
engineer or the Zoning Officer with reference to the administration of any

the administration of any transfers of development rights or performance
density provisions of this Chapter; from the determination of the Zoning
Officer or Township engineer in the administration of any land use

control and storm water management insofar as the same relate to
development not involving subdivision and land development or planned
residential development may be filed with the board in writing by the
landowner affected, any officer or agency of the Township, or any person
aggrieved. Requests for a variance and for special exception may be filed
with the board by any landowner or any tenant with the permission of such
landowner.
§ 27-2615. Time Limitations.
2. The nature and intensity of the operations involved are in harmony with
the orderly and appropriate development of the district in which the use
is to be located.
3. The grant of the special exception shall not materially increase traffic
congestion on roads and highways, nor cause nor encourage
commercial or industrial traffic to use residential streets.
4. The applicant must meet all specific requirements for the specified use
in accordance with Part 21, herein.
5. In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this
Chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter and the Pennsylvania MPC, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247 as
reenacted and amended.
1. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the board later
than 30 days after an application for development, preliminary or final,
has been approved by the Township if such proceeding is designed to
secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such
person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge, or reason
to believe that such approval had been given. If such person has

FWD:955
§ 27-2616. Stay of Proceedings.
succeeded to their interest after such approval, they shall be bound by
the knowledge of their predecessor in interest. The failure of anyone
other than the land owner to appeal from an adverse decision on a
tentative plan or from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a
challenge to the validity of this Chapter or an amendment hereto or
map or an amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from a final
approval except in the case where the final submission substantially
deviates from the approved tentative approval.
2. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed
by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination is
issued.
1. Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the zoning hearing board
and during its pendency before the board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning
Officer or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall
be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or
body certifies to the board facts indicating that such stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or
official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order,
which may be granted by the board or by the court having jurisdiction
of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other
appropriate agency or body. When an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed
to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a
condition to continuing the proceedings before the board.
2. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to
petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by
the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court.
3. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
4. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond
and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a
bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the

appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney
fees incurred by the petitioner.

ordinance as set forth in § 607 of the Pennsylvania MPC, Act of 1968,
P.L. 805, No. 247 as reenacted and amended, is hereby declared
optional.
2. Before voting on the enactment of an amendment, the Board of
Commissioners shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public
notice. In addition, if the proposed amendment involves a zoning map
change, notice of said public hearing shall be conspicuously posted by
the Township at points deemed sufficient by the Township along the
tract to notify potentially interested citizens. The affected tract or area
shall be posted at least one week prior to the date of the hearing. In
addition to the requirement that notice be posted, where proposed
amendment involves a zoning map change, notice of the public hearing
shall be mailed by the municipality at least 30 days prior to the date of
the hearing by first class mail to the addresses to which real estate tax
bills are sent for all real property located within the area being rezoned,
as evidenced by the tax records within the possession of the
municipality. The notice shall include the location, date and time for the
public hearing. A good faith effort and substantial compliance shall
satisfy the requirements of this subsection. This clause shall not apply
with the rezoning constitutes a comprehensive rezoning.
3. In the case of an amendment other than that prepared by the Planning
Commission the Board of Commissioners shall submit each such
amendment to the Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the
hearing on such proposed amendment to provide the Planning
Commission an opportunity to submit recommendations.
4. If, after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed
amendment is changed substantially, or is revised, to include land
previously not affected by it, the Board of Commissioners shall hold
another public hearing, pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to
vote on the amendment.
5. At least 30 days prior to the public hearing on the amendment by the
Board of Commissioners, the Township shall submit the proposed
amendment to the county planning agency for recommendations.
6. Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to this
Chapter shall be forwarded to the county planning agency.

1. A landowner who desires to challenge on substantive grounds the
validity of this Chapter or the Zoning Map or any provisions thereof,
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the Board of
Commissioners with a written request that his challenge and proposed
amendment be heard and decided as provided in § 916.1 of the
Pennsylvania MPC, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247 as reenacted and
amended. The curative amendment and challenge shall be referred to
the Planning Commission and the county planning agency as provided
in § 609 and notice of the hearing thereon shall be given as provided in
§ 610 and 916.1 of the Pennsylvania MPC, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247

Commissioners, however that the deemed approval provision of § 908 of
the Pennsylvania MPC (Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247 as reenacted and
amended) shall not apply and the provision of § 916.1 the Pennsylvania
MPC shall control. If the Township does not accept a landowner's
curative amendment brought in accordance with this subsection and a
court subsequently rules that the challenge has merit, the court's
decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this entire
Chapter and Zoning Map, but only for those provisions which
specifically relate to the landowner's curative amendment and
challenge.
3. The Board of Commissioners, if it determines that a validity challenge
has merit, may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or
without revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will
cure the challenged defects. The Board of Commissioners shall consider
the curative amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by
the landowner and shall also consider:
A. The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
B. If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of this Chapter or Zoning Map.
C. The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, flood plains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features.
D. The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, flood plains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the

tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts.
E. The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
1. If the Township determines that this Chapter, or any portion hereof, is
substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:
A. The Township shall declare by formal action, this Chapter or
portions hereof substantially invalid and propose to prepare a
curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days
following such declaration and proposal the Board of
Commissioners shall:
(1) By resolution make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of this Chapter which may include:
(a) References to specific uses which are either not permitted
or not permitted in sufficient quantity,
(b) Reference to a class of use or uses which requires revision,
or
(c) Reference to this entire Chapter which requires revisions.
B. Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to this
Chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
2. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Township shall enact a curative amendment to validate, or reaffirm the
validity of, this Chapter pursuant to the provisions of § 609 of the
Pennsylvania MPC, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247 as reenacted and
amended in order to cure the declared invalidity of this Chapter.
3. Upon the initiation of the procedures as set forth in subsection 1 the
Board of Commissioners shall not be required to entertain or consider
any landowner's curative amendment filed under § 609.1 of the
Pennsylvania MPC, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247 as reenacted and
amended, nor shall the zoning hearing board be required to give a
report requested under § 909.1 or 916.1 of the Pennsylvania MPC, Act
of 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247 as reenacted and amended, subsequent to the
declaration and proposal based upon the grounds identical or
substantially similar to those specified by the resolution required by
subsection 1.A. Upon completion of the procedures set forth in
subsections 1 and 2, no rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions of
§ 609.1 and 916.1 of the Pennsylvania MPC, Act of 1968, P.L. 805, No.

validity of this Chapter; Provided, however, if after the date of
declaration and proposal there is a substantially new duty imposed

Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, the Township may utilize the
provisions of this Section to propose a curative amendment to this
Chapter to fulfill said duty or obligation.

occurred, the Township shall initiate enforcement proceedings by
sending an enforcement notice as provided in this Section.

being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a
violation by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the
district justice determining that there has been a violation further
determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership
or corporation violating this Chapter to have believed that there was no
such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the
determination of a violation by the district justice and thereafter each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
