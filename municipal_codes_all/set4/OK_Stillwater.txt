PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Stillwater, Oklahoma. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through October 4, 2007, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Paula B. Freeman and D. J. Heath, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

Within one (1) month after the date of filing of the circulated petition, the city clerk shall examine it and ascertain whether it has been prepared and circulated as required, and send said petition to the county election board who shall determine the number of registered qualified voters of the city who have signed it. The city clerk shall then attach a certificate to the petition. If the certificate states that the petition has not been circulated as required and/or lacks a sufficient number of signatures, the petition shall have no effect. But if the city clerk's certificate states that the petition has been circulated as required and has a sufficient number of signatures, the city clerk shall submit the petition and certificate to the city council at its next meeting.

Failure to surrender any animal immediately after demand for quarantine or rabies testing by an animal control officer, police officer or department designee shall be deemed in violation of this article. The impoundment and observation of the dog, cat, or ferret shall be conducted at the veterinarian's facility. Boarding kennels shall not be considered proper confinement facilities. Unvaccinated animals shall be vaccinated against rabies on the final day of the ten-day observation period prior to discharge from the veterinarian's supervision. The veterinarian shall notify animal control of the disposition of the said animal. Exceptions to this rule include the following circumstances: 
(1)  Dogs, cats, or ferrets involved in a first party ownership may be allowed to be securely confined and closely observed at the owner's home for ten-day home quarantine period immediately following the bite. The term "first party ownership" means a situation where the owner of a biting animal is directly related to the bite victim, that is parent-child, sibling-sibling, grandparent-child; or when the legal residence of the animal owner and the bite victim are the same.

If there are any changes in health or condition of an animal in a home quarantine, or if the animal dies, the person caring for that animal must take the animal directly to their veterinarian and report the change to the animal control division. A certification of animal health obtained after examination of a licensed veterinarian on the tenth day will be required and presented to animal control within two days of the end of the quarantine period. Approval for home quarantine will be determined by the animal control division officer, police officer or department designee. 
(3)  Animals in service to the blind or hearing-impaired, and search and rescue dogs or other animals used for police enforcement duties shall be exempt from quarantine when a bite exposure occurs and proper record of immunization against rabies is presented. A certification of animal health obtained after an examination by a licensed veterinarian at the end of ten days may be required by the department. 
(4)  Stray or unwanted dogs, cats, or ferrets that have bitten any person may either be quarantined for ten days at a veterinary facility or recognized quarantine facility or euthanized and the brain tissue submitted to the state department of health laboratory for rabies testing. Upon successful completion of the ten-day period, a stray animal may be placed for adoption by the animal control division's authority. At the end of the ten-day period, the animal control officer shall notify the person bitten by such animal of the disposition and/or the laboratory test results. 
(b)  If, within the impoundment period provided herein, said animal dies or exhibits symptoms or indications of rabies, it shall be examined by a veterinarian for clinical diagnosis and then properly destroyed by a licensed veterinarian. The suspect's head or the head of any rabies-suspected animal which dies shall be submitted to the state health department laboratory for confirmation of diagnosis. In this event, the animal control officer shall immediately in writing notify the person bitten of said diagnosis. 
(c)  When an examination report gives a positive diagnosis of rabies, the city health officer may recommend to the city manager citywide quarantine for a period of 30 days; and upon the invoking of such quarantine by the city manager, no animal shall be taken into the streets except under leash and complete control of a competent adult during such period of quarantine. In the event there are additional positive cases of rabies occurring during the period of the quarantine, such period of quarantine may be extended for an additional period. 
(d)  In the case of a dog, cat or ferret known to have been bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, said dog, cat or ferret shall be euthanized immediately either by a veterinarian of the owner's choice or by an animal control officer. If the owner of such dog, cat or ferret is unwilling to have such dog, cat or ferret destroyed, then, at the expense of the owner, any such unvaccinated dog, cat or ferret shall be placed in strict quarantine and observed for a period of six months under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian. The exposed animal shall be immediately vaccinated against rabies upon entry into quarantine and then given booster vaccinations at the third and eighth week of the quarantine period. Animals less than 16 weeks of age at the time of entry into quarantine could be required by the veterinarian to receive a booster vaccine in addition to the protocol set forth in this section. Any dog, cat, or ferret which is currently vaccinated against rabies and is exposed to a rabid animal shall be revaccinated immediately and isolated and confined by the owner for a period of at least 45 days.

    Every pawnbroker shall keep at his place of business, in writing or print, a description of all property taken, purchased or received by him, together with the date and time of the transaction and the name and place of residence of the person leaving the property. A duplicate pawn or seller's bill of sale transaction ticket shall suffice. Every entry shall be made in ink and shall not be obliterated or erased and shall be completed at time of transaction. A duplicate copy will also be provided to the police department of all pawns and purchases. A pawnbroker shall not be required to furnish such description of any property purchased from manufacturers or wholesale dealers or of any goods purchased at open sale or from any bankrupt stock or from any other person having an established place of business, provided that such goods shall be accompanied by a bill of sale. 
(Code 1966, § 5-23; Code 1982, § 21-3; Ord. No. 1544, § 6, 12-2-1974; Ord. No. 2229, §§ 1, 2, 1-6-1986) 
Sec. 12-304. - Inspection of articles. 
    Upon request a pawnbroker shall exhibit for inspection to the chief of police, any member of the police force, the city attorney or the district attorney for the county any article taken or received or purchased by him. 
(Code 1966, § 5-23; Code 1982, § 21-4; Ord. No. 1544, § 6, 12-2-1974) 
Sec. 12-305. - Examination, investigation and access to records. 
(a)  At such times as the chief of police may deem necessary, the chief of police or his authorized representative may make an examination of the place of business of each pawnbroker and may inquire into and examine the transactions, books, accounts, papers, correspondence and records of such pawnbroker insofar as they pertain to such business. Such books, accounts, papers, correspondence and records shall also be open for inspection at any reasonable time by any peace officer, without any need of judicial writ or other process. In the course of an examination, said peace officer shall have free access to the office, place of business, files, safes and vaults of such pawnbroker, and shall have the right to make copies of any books, accounts, papers, correspondence and records. The chief of police or his duly authorized representative may, during the course of such examination, administer oaths and examine any person under oath upon any subject pertinent to any matter about which the chief of police is authorized or required by this article to consider, investigate or secure information. Any pawnbroker who fails or refuses to permit the chief of police or his duly authorized representative or any other peace officer to examine or make copies of such books or other relevant documents shall be guilty of an offense. 
(b)  Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that property in possession of a licensed pawnbroker is stolen or embezzled, the police officer may place a written hold order on the property. The initial term of the written hold order shall not exceed 30 days. However, the holding period may be extended in successive 30-day increments upon written notification prior to the expiration of the initial holding period. If the holding period has expired and has not been extended, the hold order shall be considered expired and no longer in effect, and title shall vest in the pawnbroker subject to any restrictions contained in the pawn contract. The initial written hold order shall contain the following information: 
(1)  Signature of the pawnbroker or his designee; 
(2)  Name, title and identification number of the peace officer placing the hold order; 
(3)  Name and address of the agency to which the peace officer is attached and the offense number; 
(4)  Complete description of the property to be held, including model number, serial number and transaction number; 
(5)  Name of agency reporting the property to be stolen or embezzled; 
(6)  Mailing address of the pawnshop where the property is held; 
(7)  Expiration date of the holding period. 
(c)  While a hold order is in effect, the pawnbroker may consent to release, upon written receipt, the stolen or embezzled property to the custody of the local law enforcement agency to which the peace officer placing the hold order is attached. The consent to release the stolen or embezzled property to the custody of law enforcement is not a waiver or release of the pawnbroker's property rights or interest in the property. Otherwise, the pawnbroker shall not release or dispose of the property except pursuant to a court order or the expiration of the holding period including all extensions. The district attorney's office shall notify the pawnbroker in writing in cases where criminal charges have been filed that the property may be needed as evidence. The notice shall contain the case number, the style of the case, and a description of the property. The pawnbroker shall hold such property until receiving notice of the disposition of the case from the district attorney's office. The district attorney's office shall notify the pawnbroker in writing within 15 days of the disposition of the case. Willful noncompliance of a pawnbroker to a written hold order shall be cause for the pawnbroker's license to either be suspended or revoked pursuant to 59 O.S. § 1507 A.2. A hold order may be released prior to the expiration of any 30-day holding period by written release from the agency placing the initial hold order. 
(d)  For the purpose of discovering violations of this act or of securing information required hereunder, the chief of police or his duly authorized representative may investigate the books, accounts, papers, correspondence and records of any licensee or other person who the chief of police has reasonable cause to believe is violating any provision of this article or 59 O.S. § 1501 et seq. whether or not such person shall claim to be within the authority or scope of this article. For the purpose of this section, any person who advertises for, solicits or holds himself out as willing to make pawn transactions, shall be presumed to be a pawnbroker. 
(e)  Each licensee shall keep or make available in this state such books and records relating to pawn transactions made under this article as are necessary to enable the chief of police or designee to determine whether the licensee is complying with this article. Such books and records shall be consistent with accepted accounting practices. 
(f)  Each licensee shall preserve or make available such books and records in this state relating to each of its pawn transactions for four years from the date of the transaction, or two years from the date of the final entry made thereon, whichever is later. Each licensee's system of records shall be accepted if it discloses such information as may be reasonably required under this act. All agreements signed by customers shall be kept at an office in this city designated by the licensee, except when transferred under an agreement which gives the administrator access thereto. All credit sales made by a pawnbroker, other than those sales defined in 59 O.S. § 1502.6, as a pawn transaction, shall be made in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Title 14A of the state statutes. 
(g)  Nothing contained herein shall be construed nor interpreted to be in conflict with the provisions of 59 O.S. § 1508.

Sec. 12-306. - Report. 
(a)  Any pawnbroker shall make available a copy or report within three days of any buy transaction to the chief of police; provided, merchandise bought on invoice from a manufacturer or wholesaler with an established place of business is exempt from this reporting requirement. However, such invoice shall be shown upon request to the chief of police or his duly authorized representative or any authorized peace officer. The copy or report shall include: 
(1)  The name and address of the pawnshop; 
(2)  The name, address, race, sex, weight, height, date of birth and either identification number of the seller as verified by either a state-issued identification card, driver's license or federal government-issued identification card or by readable fingerprint of right or left index finger on the back of the pawn or buy transaction copy to be retained for the pawnbroker's record; 
(3)  The buy transaction number; 
(4)  The date and time of the transaction; 
(5)  The manufacturer of the item; 
(6)  A description of the item; and 
(7)  The serial number and model number where available and any other identifying markings. 
(b)  Items bought, except on invoice from a manufacturer or wholesaler with an established place of business, shall be held for ten days before being disposed of or sold. 
(c)  Any pawnbroker shall make available a copy or report within three days of any pawn transaction to the local law enforcement agency of the city or other political subdivision in which the pawnshop is located. The copy or report shall include: 
(1)  The name and address of the pawnshop; 
(2)  The name, address, race, sex, weight, height, date of birth and either identification number of the person making the pawn transaction with the pawnshop as verified by either a state-issued identification card, driver's license or federal government-issued identification card or by readable fingerprint of right or left index finger on the back of the pawn or buy transaction copy to be retained for the pawnbroker's record; 
(3)  The pawn transaction number; 
(4)  The date and time of the transaction; 
(5)  The manufacturer of the item; 
(6)  A description of the item; and 
(7)  The serial number and model number where available and any other identifying markings. 
(d)  The pawnbroker shall obtain a written declaration of ownership from the seller or pledgor on all buy and pawn transactions, except refinance pawn transactions or merchandise bought from a manufacturer or wholesaler with an established place of business. The seller or pledgor shall be required to state how long he has owned the property described in the transaction. The declaration of ownership shall appear on the bill of sale or pawn ticket, to be completed by the seller or the pledgor at the time of the transaction. 
State Law reference- Similar provision, 59 O.S. § 1515. 
Sec. 12-307. - Limitation on transactions. 
(a)  Multiple agreements. No pawnbroker shall separate or divide a pawn transaction into two or more transactions for the purpose or with the effect of obtaining a total pawn finance charge in excess of that authorized for an amount equal to the total of the amounts financed in the resulting transactions. 
(b)  Customer's personal liabilities prohibited. Even though a pawn transaction subject to 59 O.S. § 1501 et seq. and this article creates a debtor-creditor relationship, no pawnbroker shall make any agreement requiring the personal liability of a customer in connection with a pawn transaction, and no customer shall have an obligation to redeem pledged goods or make any payment on a pawn transaction. The only recourse of a pawnbroker where the customer has pledged goods shall be to the pledged goods themselves, unless the pledged goods are found to be stolen, embezzled, mortgaged or otherwise pledged or encumbered. Upon the customer being officially notified by a peace officer that the goods he pledged or sold to a pawnbroker were stolen or embezzled, the customer shall be liable to repay the pawnbroker the full amount the customer received from the pawn or buy transaction. Any pledged goods not redeemed within 30 days following the last fixed maturity date may thereafter, at the option of the pawnbroker, be forfeited and become the property of the pawnbroker. 
(c)  Prohibited practices. A pawnbroker shall not: 
(1)  Accept a pledge or purchase property from a person, male or female, under the age of 18 years; 
(2)  Accept any waiver, in writing or otherwise, of any right or protection accorded a customer under this article; 
(3)  Fail to exercise reasonable care to protect pledged goods from loss or damage; 
(4)  Fail to return pledged goods to a customer upon payment of the full amount due the pawnbroker on the pawn transaction, unless a hold order has been placed on the pledged goods by an authorized peace officer or the pledged goods are in the custody of law enforcement; 
(5)  Make any charge for insurance in connection with a pawn transaction, except as provided in subsection (f) of this section; 
(6)  Enter any pawn transaction which has a maturity date more than one month after the date of the transaction; or 
(7)  Accept collateral or buy merchandise from a person unable to supply verification of identity by photo I.D. by either a state-issued identification card, driver's license or federal government-issued identification card or by readable fingerprint of right or left index finger on the back of the pawn or buy transaction copy to be retained for the pawnbroker's record. 
(d)  Presumption. Except as otherwise provided by this article, any person properly identifying himself as the original customer in the pawn transaction or as the assignee thereof, and presenting a pawn transaction agreement to the pawnbroker shall be presumed to be entitled to redeem the pledged goods described therein. 
(e)  Lost or destroyed transaction agreement. If the pawn transaction agreement is lost, destroyed or stolen, the customer may so notify the pawnbroker in writing, and receipt of such notice shall invalidate such pawn transaction agreement, if the pledged goods have not previously been redeemed. Before delivering the pledged goods or issuing a new pawn transaction agreement, the pawnbroker may require the customer to make affidavit of the loss, destruction or theft of the agreement. 
(f)  Insurance. 
(1)  A pawnbroker may offer insurance to a customer at the time of the pawn transaction to provide coverage during the pawn contract period for the declared value of the items pawned. The purchase of insurance shall be at the option of the customer. 
(2)  A pawnbroker may not offer insurance coverage unless the pawnbroker: 
a.  Is licensed as a limited insurance representative for the purpose of providing insurance coverage for pawned merchandise, as required by 36 O.S. § 1424; 
b.  Has filed with the administrator of the department of consumer credit a copy of the insurance policy which shall have been issued by an insurer authorized by the insurance commissioner to transact insurance in this state; and 
c.  Has posted a copy of the policy in a conspicuous place which is readily available to the customer.

Air from a smoking room shall not be exhausted within 15 feet of any entrance, exit or air intake. Any employer may choose a more restrictive smoking policy, including being totally smoke free. 
(g)  The person who owns or operates a place where smoking or tobacco use is prohibited by law shall be responsible for posting a sign or decal, at least four inches by two inches in size, at each entrance to the building indicating that the place is smoke-free or tobacco-free.

(a)  The city manager or any other officer subordinate to the city manager, with the consent of the city manager, or any city resident, may submit to the city council a statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the ordinances of the city or state law, and a request or recommendation that it be abated. 
(b)  The city council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the city council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers, and other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, the city council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible for or to be causing the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the names or addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of the person or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation within the city. 
(c)  If the city council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall direct the owner and/or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of the person or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay. If such peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare would be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate it within the specified time, the city council shall direct the city manager to abate the nuisance or to have it abated, if summary abatement is practical, as authorized by state law. The director of finance shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to the owner and/or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance, as may be just under the circumstances, if their names and addresses are known.

At the time of collection, the county treasurer shall collect a fee of $5.00 for each parcel of property. The fee shall be deposited to the credit of the general fund of the county. If the county treasurer and the city agree that the county treasurer is unable to collect the assessment, the city may pursue a civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and interest thereon by an action in person against the property owner and an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral interest, if severed from the surface interest and not owned by the surface owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this section. Upon receiving payment, if any, the city clerk shall forward to the county treasurer a notice of such payment and directing discharge of the lien.

Such notice shall also be given in writing by mail to all owners of property, within a 300-foot radius, excluding public rights-of-way, of the exterior boundary of the subject property. Required notices shall be published and mailed at least 20 days prior to the date of the public hearing and shall contain the following:

(1)  The city council has denied a requested zoning map amendment, or, the application for a requested zoning map amendment is withdrawn by the applicant after the public hearing before the city council as required by subsection (c) of this section is convened; and 
(2)  The reapplication requests the same zoning classification for the same property or a portion thereof as previously denied or withdrawn or the reapplication is for a planned unit development map amendment that will permit substantially the same use as the previously denied or withdrawn zoning map amendment. 
The reapplication moratorium authorized in this subsection shall commence on the date of the denial or withdrawal, whichever is applicable. The director of development services shall make the initial determination whether an application for a zoning map amendment or planned unit development zoning map amendment is subject to the prohibition set forth herein.

(g)  Final plats. 
(1)  Two years from preliminary plat approval. The final plat of any portion of the proposed subdivision shall be submitted to the planning commission and city council for final approval within two years of the date on which the preliminary plat was approved. If not submitted for final approval within such time, the preliminary plat shall be considered as having been disapproved unless the planning commission agrees to an extension of time prior to the expiration date, as requested by the subdivider. The developer shall file the final plat in the office of the county clerk within two years after approval by the city council, or, if not filed within such time, said approval of the final plat shall be considered as having been voided, unless extended by the planning commission and city council upon request by the subdivider prior to the expiration date.

This acceptance of the plat shall be shown over the signature of the mayor and attested to by the director of finance or deputy.

Once accepted by the city council, the plat shall be recorded in the county courthouse. 
(5)  Requirements for commercial subdivision prior to filing with county clerk. No final plat of any commercial subdivision shall be filed of record in the office of the county clerk unless:

(b)  Exemptions. Uses in the CB district are exempt from the off-street parking where public parking is available within 1,320 feet. A parking study may be submitted which evaluates the existing parking utilization of public parking within 1,320 feet of the property. The required off-street parking requirement may be reduced by not more than 50 percent of the number of available parking spaces cited by the parking study. Available parking shall be defined as the difference between the observed parking usage and 85 percent of the total available parking spaces. The parking study shall not be required for the remodel, rehabilitation, or conversion of an existing building or structure. 
(c)  Off-street parking. Off-street motor vehicle and bicycle parking spaces accessory to the various land and building uses shall be provided to equal or exceed the minimum requirements set forth in table 4.2 in subsection (e) of this section less any applicable reduction. 
(d)  Residential/commercial mixed use. The number of off-street parking spaces required for a residential/commercial mixed use shall be determined by adding the number of spaces required for each zoning classification and dividing said total by 75 percent. 
(e)  Off-street loading. Every building or structure constructed in any district for commercial or industrial purposes requiring the receipt or distribution of material or merchandise shall have provided and maintained on the same lot with such use at least one off-street loading space for each 10,000 square feet of gross floor area, or fraction thereof. The number of loading spaces may be reduced for a particular use normally requiring at least three spaces whereby a loading space at least 11 feet wide and 60 feet long may be substituted for two spaces that would otherwise be required. 
(f)  Shared/off-site parking. The use of shared parking facilities between buildings and uses on, adjacent, or within 1,320 feet may be permitted with the following provisions: 
(1)  Shared parking for multiple uses and buildings on the same property shall not require any special permissions. Should the total uses on the property require more than 100 spaces, the parking requirements may be reduced by up to ten percent as a shared parking facility credit. 
(2)  Shared parking between two or more adjacent properties may be provided by providing an off-street connection between the parking lots on the properties with the execution of the appropriate private cross access easements or agreement. Where provided, the parking requirements may be reduced for each property by up to ten percent as a shared parking facility credit. 
(3)  Shared off-site parking for multiple uses and buildings adjacent or within 1,320 feet of the property on which the parking facility is located may be permitted upon the execution of a long-term lease agreement or permanent parking covenant. Only any parking spaces in excess of the number required for the on-site use may be permitted to be utilized by an off-site use for parking facilities, and individual parking spaces shall not be allowed to be dedicated to more than one use or business. Such spaces must be signed to indicate the business or use that is allowed to utilize the space. A parking study may be submitted for any shared parking facility with 40 or greater spaces. Such facility may serve multiple uses and businesses so long as the parking facility is demonstrated to have enough parking for each use at the peak parking period. 
(g)  Reduction of required auto parking spaces. The required number of vehicle parking spaces may be reduced as follows: 
(1)  The number of required spaces may be reduced if included in a planned unit development. 
(2)  The number of spaces required may be reduced for mixed use developments and shared parking facilities as specified in this section. 
(3)  The number of spaces required may be reduced by substituting motorcycle/scooter parking facilities at a rate of 2.5 motorcycle/scooter spaces per auto space for up to ten percent of the required spaces. 
(4)  The number of spaces required may be reduced by utilizing public spaces as specified in this section. 
(5)  The number of spaces required may be reduced by ten percent for multi-family residential uses if the property is located within 200 feet of a transit stop. 
(6)  The total amount of parking reductions and credits shall be computed by reducing the total allowed percentage of reduction from the requirement in table 4.2.

(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.221), 3-3-2008) 
Secs. 23-222-23-229. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IX. - LANDSCAPING, SCREENING AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS 

Sec. 23-230. - Generally. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. These regulations have been adopted for the purpose and intent of: 
(1)  Ensuring minimal conflict between placement of trees and other landscaping, and both overhead and underground utility lines; 
(2)  Providing for landscaping and trees to shade buildings and paved surfaces and to reduce the amount of runoff, erosion, reflected heat, air pollution, wind, and noise; 
(3)  Improving the attractiveness of the city as a place for economic growth and the general safety of developments; and 
(4)  Providing screening between incompatible land uses. 
(b)  Tree classification. The planning commission shall establish classifications of trees by category of small, medium, and large based on growth characteristics for the purpose of implementing this chapter. 
(c)  General planting and maintenance standards. The following requirements set forth in this section are applicable to trees on both public and private property: 
(1)  The requirements for tree and other landscape material locations are: 
a.  Except for areas zoned CB, or in the case of P districts located immediately adjacent to a CB district, trees shall be planted no closer to any public curb or sidewalk than three feet for small trees, four feet for medium trees, and five feet for large trees; 
b.  Except for areas zoned CB, or in the case of P districts located immediately adjacent to a CB district, landscaping and trees shall be planted to maintain clear vision at intersections; 
c.  Trees planted in the public right-of-way must be of a type which will grow tall enough so that they will not block vision of drivers to see other traffic, pedestrians, signage and traffic control devices; 
d.  Landscape material shall be planted in such a way as to not obstruct access to a fire hydrant, utility meters or utility poles; 
e.  Only those trees listed as small trees may be planted under or within ten lateral feet of any overhead utility wire, or over or within five lateral feet of any underground water, sewer, electric, telephone, cable or natural gas line. Any tree which is planted within a dedicated easement will be subject to damage, pruning and removal, as necessary, to allow full utilization of the easement and maintenance of utilities contained therein; 
f.  Plant materials being planted to meet landscape requirements of this chapter should be planted during the spring or fall months to improve chances of survival. If all other requirements are met, a certificate of occupancy will be issued for properties which are developed during the other times of the year without the landscape materials being installed, provided, however, that the plant materials must be planted within the first planting season to following completion of construction; and 
(2)  The following shall be observed in the care of existing trees: 
a.  The city shall have the right to prune, spray, or partially remove trees or shrubs that have originated within or have grown into public rights-of-way, public properties or public easements as may be necessary to protect persons and property, to provide access to public utilities, to provide needed clearances from public utility infrastructure, and to maintain visibility of traffic signals and traffic warning or directional signs. Franchised utilities operating within utility easements shall have the same rights to provide clearance and access to their equipment that is installed within dedicated easements. Whether the work is to be done by the city or a franchised utility, a property owner shall be notified by posted written notice three days prior to work on a tree located on their property or the adjacent street right-of-way, when the trimming involves removing any branch greater than 11/2 inches diameter or more than five branches of less than one-half-inch diameter. Persons receiving notice under this section may appeal to the city manager provided that such appeal is taken within three days of posting said notice. 
b.  When plant material is causing an immediate public safety threat or preventing access to a utility that is in imminent danger or is failing, the tree of shrub, or any portion thereof, may be removed to eliminate the immediate threat for emergency and/or public safety purposes without notification to property owners. When such emergency work has been carried out, property owners shall be notified of the work that was done by posted written notice. In the case of major ice storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters, posted written notice will not be left. 
c.  If development plans include preservation of existing trees or other vegetation on site during construction, the building permit plans shall specify the method to be used to protect the trees or vegetation. 
d.  When, on the basis of citizen complaint or observation by the city manager, the city manager determines that a tree poses a safety threat to persons in public ways or adjacent private or public property, the city manager may order the tree, or any portion thereof, to be removed. When the city manager orders removal of a tree on private property, the owner of the property shall be given ten days' written notice to remove the tree. If the tree has not been removed in the specified time, the city shall proceed to have the tree removed and bill the property owner the cost of removal. A lien shall also be placed on the property to recover the cost of tree removal. For the purposes of this chapter, removal shall mean cutting the tree off at ground level. The property owner may appeal the decision to trim or remove the tree to the board of adjustment; provided that such appeal is taken within ten days from the date of notification by the city forester. If such an appeal is made, action to remove the tree shall be stayed until a decision is reached by the board of adjustment. 
e.  For purposes of this section, time periods are exclusive of weekends and legal holidays. 
(d)  Multiple-family, commercial, and industrial park landscape requirements. Multiple-family uses shall be considered more than four dwelling units per lot. All new construction, expansion or redevelopment within the city for multiple-family, commercial and industrial park uses, except in the CB zoning district, shall include the provision of landscape areas to provide for the planting of trees and other landscape materials. In all cases, property within this category, including in the CB zoning district, not being used for a structure, parking space, driving aisle, open display area, sidewalk or outdoor storage area shall be maintained as landscape area. Designated or approved landscape areas shall not be used for display or storage of goods or materials. 
(1)  The actual minimum landscape area requirements for a development shall depend on the size of the associated parking area. For parking areas containing between six and 20 parking spaces, inclusive, the only landscape area required shall be the parking area setback requirement. For parking areas of more than 20 spaces, the required landscape area shall be equal to at least nine percent of the developed portion of the lot. Except as follows, the developed portion of the lot shall be considered the entire piece of property being developed: 
a.  The developed portion of the lot shall not include detention or compensatory storage areas when detention and/or compensatory storage requirements are met off of the parking surface. 
b.  When only a portion of a piece of property is being developed, that portion not being developed shall be so designated on the site plan and will not be included in the development area. 
c.  Property beyond any normal setback requirements which lies within a 100-year floodplain, or other drainage channels, and which will not be functioning as part of the detention or compensatory requirements of the site, may be designated, in whole or in part, as part of the developed area by the applicant provided that a sufficient amount of landscape area is distributed across the entire site. Because each site will be different, it will be up to the applicant and staff to agree on what is sufficient in a given case. In general, staff will be looking to see that the intent of this chapter is being met and that landscaping will not be concentrated away from public portions of the site. When an agreement cannot be reached, the planning commission shall make the final determination. 
(2)  Landscaping areas within the occupant, customer and/or employee parking area of a development, shall be located in such a way as to meet the requirements set forth in this subsection. The following requirements do not apply to areas designated for open display: 
a.  Landscape areas shall be located so that at least 60 percent of the trees planted to meet the point requirements on the site can be located within ten feet of the paved parking area. 
b.  When a parking area is to provide parking for more than 100 vehicles, landscape islands shall be provided at the ends of the rows of parking to separate the parked vehicles from an adjacent driving aisle. 
c.  Landscape areas shall be placed so that at least a portion of every parking space is within 59 feet of the parking area setback area or another landscape area meeting the minimum area requirement. The distance a parking space may be from a landscape area may be increased by one foot for each additional 30 square feet of area contained within a landscape area which is surrounded on all sides by paved parking area; provided, however, that in no case shall the distance between a parking space and a landscape area exceed 80 feet. 
(3)  Landscape area size requirements are described as follows: 
a.  The width of parking lot landscape areas shall be measured exclusive of any curbing or bumper blocks. 
b.  The standard, minimum width of a landscape area shall be four feet. At the end of a row of 90-degree parking spaces that are next to a setback area, the setback area may be reduced to two feet to facilitate backing out from a parking space. Also, specific points of other landscape areas may be reduced to as narrow as two feet to meet design requirements. Landscape areas placed parallel to a parking space, or at the end of a row of parking spaces shall be no less than two feet shorter than the paved length of the parking stall. Except for the buffer strip areas, landscape areas that have bumper overhang shall have a minimum of four feet of width in addition to the bumper overhang. 
c.  A landscape area placed parallel to a parking space, or at the end of a row of parking, shall be a minimum of 80 square feet, if one parking stall in length, and 165 square feet if two stalls in length. Any other landscape areas shall be a minimum of 80 square feet in size. 
(4)  To provide flexibility in designing the best landscape plan for each site, no specific materials or locations are required for landscaping by these regulations. 
a.  Developments shall include landscape material from the following list, in any combination, such that the total points received for the development equal at least 50 points per 100 square feet in all areas: 
1.  Berms, minimum 30 inches tall earn five points per ten linear feet. 
2.  Turf shall earn ten points per 100 square feet. 
3.  Vegetative ground cover (other than natural turf or sod) shall earn 25 points per 100 square feet of cover. 
4.  Small shrubs (mature height of four feet) shall earn 25 points each. 
5.  Large shrubs (mature height over four feet) shall earn 75 points each. 
6.  Trees of one-inch caliper or greater at the time of planting which are classified as follows: 
(i)  Small trees earn 100 points; 
(ii)  Medium trees earn 150 points and shall be designated by a scaled 20-foot diameter circle; 
(iii)  Large trees earn 200 points and shall be designated by a scaled 35-foot diameter circle; 
(iv)  Evergreen trees shall be designated by a scaled 20-foot diameter circle. 
7.  Preservation of existing trees will earn the same base points as new trees based on the size classification of tree. For trees over four-inch caliper, an additional 20 points will be awarded for each inch of caliper over four, up to double the point value of the tree. (For example: saving a tree which is classified in the large tree category will earn 200 points; if the tree measures to be eight-inch caliper, an additional 80 points will be awarded.) The diameter of the tree shall be measured at 41/2 feet above the ground. 
8.  Any plant materials installed to meet the requirements of this chapter which die, or are otherwise removed, must be replaced with plant materials which will earn at least the same number of points. If the replacement materials are to be located more than 20 feet from where the previous materials had been, a revised landscape plan shall be submitted to the city planner for administrative review and approval. 
b.  Site plan designation. Site plans shall be labeled with the number of square feet contained within each landscape area. The landscaping shown on site plans shall specify the vegetation according to the categories listed below. Symbols shall be used to identify planting sites for landscape materials as designated below, and standard sizes shall be used for trees. Landscaping in addition to that shown on the site plan is encouraged and will not be a violation of the site plan. The required site plan designations shall be: 
1.  "Berm," and the contour thereof at 30 inches of height; 
2.  "TF" for turf; 
3.  "GC" for vegetative ground covers; 
4.  "SS" for small shrubs; 
5.  "LS" for large shrubs; 
6.  "ST" for a small tree; 
7.  "MT" for a medium tree; 
8.  "LT" for a large tree; and 
9.  "EV" for evergreen trees. 
(5)  Plans submitted for building permits for these developments shall include the information required by this section in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with these regulations. For those developments which require city council site plan approval prior to the issuance of a building permit, a conceptual landscape plan shall be included with the site plan. The minimum requirements for this conceptual landscape plan include: 
a.  The location of all landscape area; 
b.  The calculations showing compliance with the minimum landscape area requirements and what the minimum point requirements are for plan material; 
c.  An illustration of the concept which will be used in placement of landscape materials by area across the site (i.e., the approximate number and size as well as the general location of trees, shrubs, and ground covers); and 
d.  Existing trees which will be preserved. 
In approving any site plan reviewed by the planning commission and/or city council, they may reserve the right to review the final landscape plan prior to issuance of a building permit. 
(e)  Visual barriers and transitional yards. Visual barriers and/or transitional yards are to be provided as required in this subsection to help separate more intense land uses from less intense ones, and to screen some uses from view. The visual barrier may have openings of reasonable length to accommodate driveways and walkways. 
(1)  Certain districts of more intense use are to have visual barriers installed when they abut districts of less intense use. 
a.  In such cases, visual barriers are not required when parking lots abut one another, no matter what zoning district. 
b.  When the office district abuts an RSS, RSL, RT or RM district, a visual barrier is required on the property zoned office district. 
c.  When CS, CB, CG, IL or IG district abuts an RSS, RSL, RMH, RT or RM district, a visual barrier is required on the property zoned CS, CB, CG, IL or IG district. 
d.  Separation of properties by an alley, right-of-way or road easement does not exempt such properties from these requirements. 
(2)  Wherever any provision of his chapter requires the construction and maintenance of a visual barrier or transitional yard as a condition for initiating and subsequently continuing any use, such barrier or yard shall be constructed and maintained on the lot containing or proposed to contain such use, in accordance with the provisions of this section. When the area required to have a visual barrier is within a utility easement, the visual barrier shall be constructed as required in this subsection. When located within a dedicated easement, the materials used to construct the visual barriers may be removed without liability for replacement by a public utility, or private contractor representing a public utility, to gain access for the installation, removal, extension or repair of utility lines and equipment. Such barriers and yards shall also make provision for easy access to meters, transformers, junction boxes, and other utility equipment commonly found in utility easements. Visual barriers shall not impede access to dumpsters and access by emergency personnel. Locations and situations where visual barriers or transitional yards are required include the following: 
a.  As may be required as a condition of approval of a site plan for a specific use or planned unit development; 
b.  Along the frontage of a principal or minor arterial street where there is open storage of equipment, machinery, materials, products, supplies, vehicles or work in progress which is not otherwise screened from the street by building, except for temporary uses, and except for the display and sale or rental of operable motor vehicles, recreational vehicles, trailers, mobile homes, boats, aircraft, construction equipment and farm machinery in the districts where permitted; and 
c.  Along certain portions of district boundaries, provided also that where a lot falls within the provisions of this subsection, no part of such lot that is within 100 feet of the abutting property shall be developed, used, or subsequently maintained for any use that is not a use of right in the district in which the abutting property is located or in an RM district, unless and until there is provided on such lot a visual barrier meeting the requirements of this section. 
(3)  The purpose of visual barriers and transitional yards is to provide separation between uses and screen potentially unsightly areas. These goals can be met in a variety of ways described as follows: 
a.  When a visual barrier is required for the purpose of screening outdoor storage areas, the provided barrier shall be at least 80 percent opaque, and not less than six feet high above the highest point within ten feet of either side of the property line, exclusive of any earth berms created to satisfy this requirement. 
b.  When a visual barrier or transitional yard is required to provide separation between land uses, the design of the barrier or yard shall follow the guidelines set forth in this subsection. The type of materials used to provide the visual barrier will vary depending upon the width of the transitional yard. 
1.  A yard width up to five feet shall require a visual barrier that is at least 75 percent opaque up to four feet, and 60 percent opaque between four and six feet above the height of the highest point within ten feet of either side of the property line, exclusive of any earth berms created to satisfy this requirement. 
2.  A yard width over five feet and up to ten feet wide shall require a visual barrier that is at least 70 percent opaque up to three feet, and 50 percent opaque between three and six feet tall above the height of the highest point within ten feet of either side of the property line, exclusive of any earth berms created to satisfy this requirement. 
3.  A yard width over ten feet shall require a visual barrier that is at least 70 percent opaque up to three feet, and 40 percent opaque up to five feet tall above the height of the highest point within ten feet of either side of the property line, exclusive of any earth berms created to satisfy this requirement. 
c.  Visual barriers may consist of any combination of earth berms, shrubs, trees, fences, and other natural and decorative man made materials. Where vegetation is used to provide the visual barrier it shall immediately provide at least 50 percent of the required screening and will be given two years from the date of installation to achieve the height and coverage designated for the given screen or transitional yard. When vegetation is proposed to provide the required visual barrier, the plans for the development shall specify the types of plant material to be used in order to evaluate whether or not the proposed plant material can meet the screening requirement. 
d.  All properties within the city shall be required to meet these requirements within one year of April 15, 2008. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.230), 3-3-2008) 
Sec. 23-231. - Environmental standards. 
(a)  Glare. No indoor or outdoor artificial lighting source, or building or structural facade, shall direct or reflect light such that the glare is a nuisance to other properties or creates a distraction to, or impairs the vision of, motor vehicle drivers on any public street. 
(b)  Air, water and solid waste. All uses shall be in compliance with applicable regulations administered by local, state and federal agencies.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 23-294. - Special zoning district category. 
    The planned unit development, herein referred to as PUD, is a special zoning overlay category that provides an alternate approach to conventional land use controls. As a type of development and as a regulatory process, the planned unit development is subject to special review procedures, and once approved it becomes a supplemental zoning classification for the property it represents. It is not intended to serve as a separate zoning classification and cannot be used to introduce a use into an area that is zoned in a manner that the proposed use is not permitted as a matter of right. The PUD designation may be applied to any one or more conventional districts, except the A, P, and U districts, which shall delineate segments of the PUD for the purpose of establishing the permitted uses and density. All Stillwater City Code land use requirements shall apply unless modified by approval of a PUD plan. The PUD is not to be utilized only for the purpose of obtaining a variance to the bulk standards or other City Code requirements. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(art. 11, div. 1), 3-3-2008; Ord. No. 3180, § 9, 5-21-2012) 
Sec. 23-295. - Purpose of planned unit developments. 
    The regulations for the planned unit development zoning district are designed to: 
(1)  Encourage diversified living environments, and accommodate a mixture of land uses that otherwise would not be allowed together on the same site; 
(2)  Permit flexibility within the development with respect to area and bulk standards to best utilize the physical features of a particular tract of land that would not be allowed under other circumstances; 
(3)  Provide and preserve meaningful open space, particularly where it is necessary or desirable for such common areas to be shared by more than one owner; 
(4)  Encourage a more efficient use of land, public services, and natural resources than is generally achieved through conventional development; 
(5)  Provide a smooth transition from surrounding densities, intensities, and uses with those proposed in the PUD; 
(6)  Encourage the provision of amenities beyond the minimum requirements of conventional development; 
(7)  Encourage accessible and affordable housing. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.295), 3-3-2008; Ord. No. 3180, § 10, 5-21-2012) 
Sec. 23-296. - Goals. 
    Each PUD proposal shall incorporate the stated goals to the extent possible. Whenever any proposal, or portion thereof, is in conflict with the stated goals, the PUD may be denied or tabled until such conflicting item(s) is/are addressed. 
(a)  Urban infill. Development is encouraged on sites which can be conveniently served by existing public services and community facilities and which make accommodations for at least one bus stop. Unless mitigated by the development plan, a PUD shall not: 1) over burden any local, collector or arterial street in the immediate area nor create the need for major off-site public improvements; 2) require the upsizing of existing sewer lines to serve the proposed development; 3) require the upsizing of existing water mains to serve the development. 
(b)  Alternative open space. Higher intensity developments may benefit from the provision of one or more of the following alternative forms of open space: 
(1)  The proposed PUD, if containing residential uses, will have common open space developed as recreation and/or leisure oriented improvements such as a swimming pool, tennis courts, children's playground, etc. 
(2)  Common open space provided as a buffer at least 100 feet wide between existing development and the PUD. 
(3)  The PUD provides recreation areas for use by the surrounding neighborhood and the PUD. 
(c)  Developments may provide for a mixture of uses or individual uses and designs not otherwise allowed.

DIVISION 2. - DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES 

Sec. 23-305. - Authority. 
    The planned unit development (PUD) provides the opportunity for varying densities, greater design flexibility, mixed land uses, and improved marketability. The applicant may be required to provide amenities above and beyond those required in a conventional development. Review and approval of a PUD is a process to achieve the intent and purpose of these regulations and the comprehensive plan. In all cases, PUDs are to be reviewed as to the type and location of a proposed use and whether the overall design of the development is compatible with its surroundings. Standards and criteria established herein shall be used in any such determination. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.305), 3-3-2008) 
Sec. 23-306. - Standards. 
(a)  Permitted uses. A planned unit development (PUD) may be considered for any single use or combination of uses allowed in the underlying zoning district. 
(b)  Area and bulk standards. The design of the PUD may necessitate modification of conventional zoning requirements such as lot size, yards, lot coverage, parking, landscaping/screening, and building height on individual lots. The minimum lot size for any proposed PUD development shall be one acre unless the proposed PUD is located within an area designated as a special purpose overlay district. 
(c)  Screening. The PUD application shall show graphically the transitional treatment between residential and commercial zoning districts and uses that will be employed to separate the PUD from abutting properties, including commitments to fencing, vegetation, earth berms, landscape screening, or similar buffering techniques. 
(d)  Access and circulation. The traffic circulation system within the PUD shall provide for the safe, convenient, and efficient movement of goods and people with a minimum of conflict between various modes of movement. Sidewalks or pedestrian trails shall be provided for pedestrian movement within the development and shall connect with existing pedestrian systems or allow for future extensions to activity centers such as schools and shopping areas outside the development. Shared parking facilities shall be encouraged with common access driveways within the development and abutting arterial streets. Consideration shall be given to designs with reduced conventional local street widths engineered with limited length and with two or fewer access points. 
(e)  Open space. Open space shall be provided for the common use of the residents or users of the PUD. Such open space and other common use facilities shall be located so as to be convenient and visually attractive to all of the intended users, as well as to protect flood hazard areas and natural wild life habitats. Open space areas shall be left in their natural state or landscaped and maintained in accordance with the approved plans for environmental amenity, recreational, or park use. 
(f)  Signs. Signs shall be regulated for all uses as follows: 
(1)  All signs shall be accessory to the identified uses within the PUD. 
(2)  Monument signs, wall signs, and marquee signs are permitted by right. 
(3)  Pole signs are permitted as based on the underlying zoning district requirements of article VII, division 2, of this chapter, signs. 
(4)  Signs shall identify only the uses within the PUD. 
(5)  Monument signs shall not exceed four feet in height if placed between the right-of-way line and the front setback and shall not exceed ten feet in height when meeting the front setback. 
(g)  Common facilities. Privately owned common areas may be established where certain facilities are shared by several adjacent property owners within the PUD, or are available to the general public for use in connection with visiting individual properties in the PUD. Such common facilities may include private streets, off-street parking and access drives, service areas, recreational facilities, plazas and other open space, provided, however, at least 15 percent of the area of any common open space shall be used for landscaping and/or pedestrian amenities. Common areas are to be shown on the plat/plan. 
(h)  Improvements. The areas requiring improvements are as follows: 
(1)  Public. All structures and subdivision improvements within a PUD shall be constructed to city standards. The standards and requirements for paving of public streets shall be observed for all publicly dedicated streets within or adjacent to a PUD. A hard-surfaced pedestrian system, constructed to city standards and meeting ADA compliance, which may, but not necessarily, be conventional curbline or property-line sidewalks shall be provided connecting all building areas, parking areas, and common facilities on the site, and that of the city as existing or planned. If it is not to be located in the public right-of-way, such pedestrian system shall be designated on the final PUD plan and the PUD plat as a pedestrian easement. 
(2)  Private. Private local streets may be permitted in a PUD but shall be constructed and inspected to city standards with the following exceptions: 
a.  Private streets may be reduced in width to 22 feet back of curb to back of curb with no on-street parking or another design as approved by development services; and 
b.  Private streets may provide an alternate design to curb and gutter. Private streets shall be contained within the PUD and within private roadway easements unless utilities are installed in combination with the development of streets. All utilities shall be placed in publicly dedicated easements. 
All easements for private local street use shall be identified and labeled as an outlot. Sidewalks or pedestrian trails not located in the public right-of-way shall be designated on the final PUD plan and the PUD final plat as a pedestrian easement. 
(3)  Maintenance of private streets. It is the developer's responsibility to provide for continued maintenance of all improvements and open space not dedicated to and accepted by the city. 
(i)  Bicycle paths. The PUD shall designate hard-surfaced routes for bicycles within the PUD and shall connect to the existing city bike route system where applicable. 
(j)  Transition setback. Where a PUD in any zoning district, except the High Rise district, abuts an existing residential development or residential zoning district, the density transition area shall be established for a depth of 100 feet along the common property line of the subject PUD property and the abutting zoning district. 
Abutting Zoning District Maximum Transitional Density RSL 8 dwelling units per acre RSS 10 dwelling units per acre RT 13 dwelling units per acre RTM 25 dwelling units per acre RMI 40 dwelling units per acre RMU 75 dwelling units per acre

Sec. 23-343. - Phasing. 
    The construction of the required improvements may be phased, provided that each phase addresses those improvements discussed in this article that are necessary to fully comply with the requirements of said this Code and all other applicable requirements or regulations. Proposed phasing plans shall be submitted to the development services director for review and approval. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.343), 3-3-2008) 
Sec. 23-344. - Construction. 
(a)  Developer to conform to construction requirements. The developer shall furnish and install, at its own expense, the labor and material necessary to complete the required improvements. Said construction shall conform with the plans as accepted by the development services department, this Code and all other applicable requirements or regulations (collectively "construction requirements"). 
(b)  Plan amendments. All changes to previously approved plans shall be submitted to the city for review and approval prior to proceeding with the change. Projects or phrases of projects that have been noticed for noncompliance shall not be considered substantially complete until such time that the developer has demonstrated that the changes are in strict compliance with the construction requirements or the noncompliant work has been removed and re-constructed in accordance with the approved plans. 
(c)  Time for completion. The required improvements shall be completed within two years from the date the plans are accepted by the city or such later date for completion as may be established and acknowledged in writing by the development services director.

(f)  Street closures. No temporary lane or street closures on existing streets shall be allowed without the prior approval of the city engineer. Requests for temporary lane or street closures on existing streets shall be made in writing to the development services director no later than four business days prior to the planned closure. The development services director shall coordinate temporary closure requests with the city engineer to ensure prompt review and response to all such requests. All requests shall include a traffic control plan. Traffic control plans shall be prepared in accordance with the standards contained within the latest version of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The city engineer may require special construction sequencing or any other condition of approval to provide for the minimal impact and inconvenience to the traveling public. Access to existing private drives that are impacted by the project shall be maintained at all times by the developer until permanent improvements are in place and have met city standards. The developer shall, at its own expense, be responsible for keeping on-site streets, off-site streets used as construction routes and rights-of-way clear of mud, rock and debris at all times during said construction. Should developer fail to meet said requirements, city may take corrective action and charge the developer for the actual cost of cleanup. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.344), 3-3-2008) 
Sec. 23-345. - Testing and inspection. 
(a)  The developer shall employ, at its own expense, a qualified testing company to perform the materials testing necessary to demonstrate compliance with any approved plans and construction requirements and shall furnish copies of test results to the city on a periodic basis throughout the construction period. 
(b)  The city shall have the right to inspect materials and workmanship at any time during the construction process. The city shall conduct such inspections in a reasonably expeditious manner with as little interruption to the construction as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances. All materials used and work completed shall strictly conform to the plans and the construction requirements. Any material or work not conforming to the plans and the construction requirements shall be repaired or removed and replaced at the developer's expense. Inspections shall follow established administrative practices and procedures. Passage of an inspection during construction shall not constitute acceptance of any materials or workmanship by the city. Nor shall inspections relieve the developer, in any way, of its obligation to comply with any approved plans and construction requirements. Such construction or work shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved. Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of the codes or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of the building codes or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. It shall be the duty of the contractor to cause the work to remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Upon completion of the inspection, the developer shall be notified, in writing, of the results of the inspection. 
(c)  The city shall issue a notice of noncompliance (notice) whenever an inspection determines that construction does not comply with any approved plans and construction requirements. Notice will be issued to the developer's contractor at the construction site if the contractor is available and a copy of the notice will be sent to the developer. The contractor shall notify the city inspector when the item has been corrected and is ready for inspection. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.345), 3-3-2008) 
Sec. 23-346. - Substantial completion of required improvements. 
(a)  Once the developer has substantially completed the required improvements as defined in this article, the developer may request a substantial completion inspection. Such request shall be in writing and directed to the development services director. Upon receipt of the request, the city will perform a substantial completion inspection of the required improvements, and if necessary, issue a punch list of items that are required to be corrected. If it is determined that deficiencies exist and the project is not substantially complete, the city will notify the developer in writing, and the substantial completion inspection shall be delayed until such time as such deficiencies are addressed by the developer. Upon confirmation by the city that the project is substantially complete, a notice of substantial completion will be issued to the developer by the development services director. Issuance of a notice of substantial completion shall not be deemed or construed as an acceptance or final approval of any of the required improvements. 
(b)  The city will not conduct a substantial completion inspection until the required improvements are accessible and cleaned sufficiently to allow for detailed inspection. If the required improvements are not accessible or cleaned sufficiently to allow for a detailed inspection, the developer will be notified in writing that the inspection has been delayed until such time that the required improvements are sufficiently accessible and cleaned. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.346), 3-3-2008) 
Sec. 23-347. - Final approval and acceptance. 
(a)  Upon completion of the required improvements, the developer shall request a final inspection in writing from the development services director. Upon receipt of the request, the city will perform a final inspection of the required improvements, and if necessary, issue a punch list of items, within five calendar days from the final inspection. If the project is not complete and/or not ready for a final inspection, or if the required improvements are not sufficiently accessible and cleaned, the city will notify the developer in writing. The city will not inspect the required improvements until they are accessible and cleaned sufficiently to allow for detailed inspection. Upon confirmation by the city that the required improvements have been constructed and the record drawings prepared in accordance with any construction requirements, a notice of completion will be issued to the developer and will state the date in which the public improvements will be scheduled for acceptance by the city council. Prior to the date that the public improvements are scheduled for acceptance by the city council, a public improvement warranty as required in this article shall be delivered to the development services director. 
(b)  The portion of the required improvements intended for public ownership shall be conveyed to the city at no cost or expense to the city and free of any liens, charges, or encumbrances. 
(c)  As each portion of the required improvements intended for public ownership are accepted by the city council, the accepted improvements will become public facilities and the property of the city, and such acceptance shall commence the warranty period and performance obligations contained in section 23-349. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.347), 3-3-2008) 
Sec. 23-348. - Record drawings. 
    Two sets of record drawings for the improvements herein required, signed and sealed by a professional engineer licensed in the state, shall be submitted to the development services director with or prior to the developer's request for a final inspection. The city will review the record drawings for general compliance with the accepted construction plans and the improvements as constructed in the field. The city will notify the developer in writing that the record drawings are acceptable, or why they are not. The record drawings shall be revised, if necessary, and accepted prior to the scheduling of the acceptance by the city council of any improvements constructed by the developer.

(b)  Inspection. The city may perform a warranty inspection prior to the end of the warranty period, and if necessary, issue a warranty punch list of items that are required to be corrected. 
(c)  Deficiencies. All deficiencies identified in the warranty punch list shall be corrected by the developer no later than seven calendar days prior to the expiration of the warranty. If all deficiencies are not corrected at least seven days prior to the expiration of the warranty, the warranty period shall be extended until all deficiencies have been corrected. 
(d)  Reinspection. The developer shall inform the city upon completion of the warranty punch list items. The city will reinspect the improvements identified in the punch list. 
(e)  Warranty release. Upon determination that the improvements identified in the warranty punch list are in compliance with this article and city standards, the city shall issue a release of warranty obligation to the developer. 
(f)  Defective improvements. Nothing herein shall be construed or deemed as requiring the city to release the developer from its obligations on any improvements that are defective.

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, all streets that are shown on the approved plat shall be constructed in accordance with city standards, subject to the following: 
(1)  Driveways. All driveways which connect with public streets shall be constructed in accordance with this chapter and city standards. 
(2)  Transportation fee. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for new residential, commercial or industrial construction, the permit applicant shall pay a transportation fee to be used by the city for the exclusive purpose of planning, designing and constructing capacity enhancements to the city's transportation system. New one- and two-family residential construction shall be assessed a fee of $0.075 per square foot of lot area, said amount not to exceed $750.00 per dwelling unit. All other new construction shall be assessed a fee of $0.075 per square foot of platted land area or development area as shown on the final site plan for the proposed construction or $750.00, whichever is greater. The fee shall also apply to additions to existing commercial or industrial buildings in which the building footprint of the building being expanded increases by 25 percent or more. The fee for building additions shall be based on the additional building footprint area and the land area of the site improvements required by code to support the building addition. This fee shall remain in place until such time that the city can comprehensively assess the increased transportation demands created by the growth of the community, identify the capacity enhancements to the city's transportations system required to meet those demands and establish a revenue source to fund the required enhancements. 
(3)  Intersection. The design of an improvement of an intersection of any new or existing street with an existing state or federal highway shall be in accordance with the standards of the state department of transportation, but in no case shall the design be less than required by the city standards. 
(b)  Private streets may be used to provide access to a development in lieu of dedicated public streets provided that the streets meet the minimum width and minimum structural standards of the city and are inspected by the city. Private streets shall be maintained by the owners of record. A private street access and maintenance agreement between the owners, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, shall be filed contemporaneously with the filing of the final plat at the county courthouse; said agreement shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following requirements: 
(1)  The agreement shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk for the purpose of reflecting the provisions of said agreement within the abstracts of title of the lots within the subdivision. 
(2)  When in the interest of providing public access to adjacent properties that may not otherwise have access to public streets, the city council may require the dedication of public right-of-way and may further require that public streets be provided within said right-of-way. 
(3)  Upon annexation of any subdivision containing private streets, the private streets shall remain private unless accepted by the city council and made available to the general public. 
(c)  Streets shall have paved lanes for traffic movement as follows: Whenever on-street parking is permitted on one side of the street, the minimum street width shall be 27 feet from the back of curb to the back of curb, and such parking shall be located on the opposite side of the street from the sidewalk. Whenever on-street parking is to be permitted on two sides of the street, the minimum street width shall be 35 feet from the back of curb to the back of curb. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.355), 3-3-2008) 
Sec. 23-356. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  Required on both sides of the street. Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of all arterial and collector four-lane and arterial two-lane streets except as provided herein. Sidewalks shall only be required on one side of all other streets as set forth herein. All sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with applicable standard specifications of the city. 
(b)  Not required. A sidewalk shall not be required: 
(1)  On collector or local streets in those areas zoned and used for industrial purposes; 
(2)  In any subdivision wherein the minimum lot size is 20,000 square feet; or 
(3)  Whenever a cul-de-sac is shorter than 500 feet in length. 
Any request for relief from the requirements set forth in this section shall be through an application for a variance to the board of adjustment. The criteria for granting a variance herein shall be the same as set forth in 11 O.S. § 44-107. Denial of a request for relief under this section by the board of adjustment shall be immediately appealable to the district court of the county in accordance with section 23-69. 
(c)  Fee in lieu of construction if determined by director. A developer or builder may pay a fee to the city in lieu of construction of a sidewalk required under this section whenever the development services director determines that existing conditions make construction impractical. The fee shall be based on the amount of linear feet of sidewalk required and sufficient to pay for the construction of the sidewalk. The city council shall have the authority to establish a schedule of any such fees by resolution and the fee schedule shall be reviewed at least annually. A fee collected under this section shall be placed in a separate escrow account and shall not be used to construct a sidewalk anywhere but on the property for which the fee was paid. 
(d)  Sidewalk requirements. The following are the requirements for sidewalks: 
Street Classification and Number of Lanes Residential One- and Two-Family All Others Arterial or collector, three lanes or more Both sides, six feet Both sides, six feet Arterial or collector, two-lane One side, six feet Both sides, six feet, unless the comprehensive arterial sidewalk map indicates that the sidewalk shall only be on one side of the street; sidewalks located on one side of an arterial shall be eight feet wide Local One side, four feet Both sides, six feet  
Whenever a sidewalk is required on one side of the street, the sidewalk shall be located on the north or east sides of the street; provided, that at such time the improvement plans are approved, the development services director may authorize an alternative sidewalk location to prevent any placement conflict. The sidewalk system within residential subdivisions shall be continuous, and the sidewalk termination ramp on one side of a street shall be located directly opposite of the beginning ramp on the other side of the street in a perpendicular direction to the street. 
(e)  Two-lane arterial street impact fee; reimbursement. A developer responsible for constructing a single eight-foot sidewalk along a two lane arterial street as set forth above shall be entitled to reimbursement for 50 percent of the cost of said construction from the developer of property across such street. The city shall be responsible for assessing and disbursing such cost reimbursement which shall be collected from the benefited developer in the form of a sidewalk impact fee. Said fee shall be determined by taking the total linear foot distance of the benefited property abutting the two lane arterial street, multiplying said amount by the per foot cost of constructing the sidewalk, and reducing the result by 50 percent. If no sidewalk has been built on the opposite side of the street but such is indicated by the comprehensive arterial sidewalk map, an estimate of the per foot construction cost shall be used instead. The city shall disburse any sidewalk impact fee payment tendered herein to the developer responsible for the sidewalk construction upon determination that said improvements meet the applicable city standards and acceptance by the city. If no sidewalk has been constructed as provided herein, then the city shall place any sidewalk impact fee received into an escrow account and shall disburse said amount to the developer responsible for construction of the sidewalk upon determination that said improvements meet the applicable city standards and acceptance by the city. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any sidewalk constructed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(f)  Sidewalk construction is the responsibility of the homebuilder or site developer. With the exception of those sidewalks that do not directly abut the front or side lot line of any building lot within the subdivision, sidewalks shall be the responsibility of: 
1.  The homebuilder in residential subdivisions, 
2.  The building developer on a commercially or industrially platted lot, 
3.  And the site developer for a development through the CUBR process. 
All sidewalks that do not directly abut the front or side lot line of any residential, industrial, or commercial building lot shall be considered to be a part of the required improvements that are the responsibility of the owner/developer. 
Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, a sidewalk that is the homebuilder's or site/building developer's responsibility shall be constructed in accordance with city standards. 
(g)  Approval of application for lot split or minor subdivision not conditioned upon construction of sidewalk. The approval of an application for a minor subdivision or lot spit under this chapter shall not be conditioned upon the construction of a sidewalk in accordance with this section, it being the intention of the city council that such requirement not be imposed until such time as development actually occurs on any parcels created under either of these processes. Whenever such development does occur, the requirements for construction of sidewalks on such parcels shall be the same as set forth in subsection (d) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.356), 3-3-2008; Ord. No. 3051, § 47, 12-15-2008; Ord. No. 3201, § 10, 9-17-2012; Ord. No. 3320, § 1, 8-24-2015 ) 
Sec. 23-357. - Water distribution system. 
(a)  The city shall be responsible for the design, materials, and installation of water lines shown on the master water plan, subject to available funding. The city shall install these lines as needed for service to a given site when development commences on the property. At the city's option, a line size less than shown on the master water plan may be installed by the city in order to ensure that water quality standards and the conditions of subsection (b) of this section are met. Any future upsizing by the city to meet the master water plan will be at city expense. The developer shall be responsible for the design, materials and installation of all other water distribution system to serve its proposed development and entire tract of property with the following exception: For those properties that are located within the Urban Core Neighborhood Subarea and the Downtown Subarea as shown in the latest version of the Comprehensive Community Development Plan as approved by the city council, the city may reimburse the developer for 75 percent of the materials and installation costs for the off-site water lines and appurtenances that are required to meet the city's fire flow requirements. The developer may submit a written request to the development services director for reimbursement. The reimbursement request shall include a plan showing the water line improvements and a detailed cost estimate to support the requested reimbursement amount. The reimbursement request will be presented to the city council, and if approved, the developer shall enter into a water line reimbursement agreement with the city prior to commencing construction of the off-site water lines. Reimbursement shall be based on actual costs certified by the developer and shall not occur until after the off-site water lines have been completed and accepted by the city council. Reimbursement for off-site water lines shall be subject to available funding. The design shall meet the requirements of this Code and the state department of environmental quality (ODEQ) and provide water service to all points on the property. The design fire flow shall not be less than the minimum fire flow requirements as established by this Code. The water system design calculations shall be submitted to the city with the submission of the water improvement plans. The proposed plans will not be approved by the city and released for review by ODEQ until the city has determined that the proposed plans and system calculations meet the city standards. 
(b)  The developer is responsible for the design and installation of water distribution system of sufficient size to serve its proposed development. If the city requires a larger line in order to provide water to other properties, the city shall pay to the developer the difference between the current price for the materials needed to serve the development and the larger size being required by the city. The developer is responsible for the installation of the service line from the water main to the water meter location with the installation of the water main

ARTICLE XVIII. - FLOOD HAZARD REGULATIONS[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
State Law reference- Oklahoma Floodplain Management Act, 82 O.S. § 1601 et seq. 

Sec. 23-370. - Statutory authorization; findings of fact; purpose and methods. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has in 82 O.S. §§ 1601-1618, as amended, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council ordains the following. 
(b)  Findings of fact. The following findings of fact establish the need for flood hazard regulations in the city: 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which may adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(d)  Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations use the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, are protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(6)  Maintain channels and vegetation in floodprone areas so as to not increase flood hazards.

(2)  Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) means FEMA's comment on whether a proposed project would be excluded from FEMA's comment on a proposed project that would affect the hydrologic and/or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway or effective base flood elevations. There is no appeal period. The letter becomes effective on the date sent. This letter does not revise an effective FIRM, it indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would or would not be removed from the floodplain by FEMA if later submitted as a request for a letter of map revision. 
(3)  Conditional letter of map revision based on fill (CLOMR-F) means FEMA's comment on whether a proposed project would be excluded from FEMA's comment on whether a proposed project involving the placement of fill would exclude an area from the floodplain shown on the FIRM. There is no appeal period. The letter becomes effective on the date sent. This letter does not revise an effective FIRM, it indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would or would not be removed from the SFHA by FEMA if later submitted as a request for a letter of map revision based on fill. 
(4)  Letter of map amendment (LOMA) means FEMA's comment on whether a proposed project would be excluded from an official amendment, by letter, to an effective FIRM. A LOMA establishes a property's location in relation to the floodplain. There is no appeal period. The letter becomes effective on the date sent. 
(5)  Letter of map revision (LOMR) means FEMA's comment on whether a proposed project would be excluded from an official revision, by letter, to an effective FIRM. A LOMR may change flood insurance risk zones, floodplain and/or floodway boundary delineations, planimetric features, and/or base flood elevations. See the LOMR effective chart to determine when a LOMR becomes effective. 
(6)  Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) means FEMA's comment on whether a proposed project would be excluded from an official revision, by letter, to an effective FIRM. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the base flood elevation and excluded from the floodplain. The letter becomes effective on the date sent. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Start of construction , for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The term "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. The term "permanent construction" does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the term "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. 
(1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure, or the greater of 500 square feet or 35 percent of the floor area of the structure either: 
a.  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
b.  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
(2)  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places; provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of these regulations or ordinance when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by these regulations. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this community's floodplain management regulations. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(f)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the floodplain or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.372), 3-3-2008)

(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated 12 inches above the base flood elevation. A licensed professional engineer or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 12 inches above the base flood level as certified by a licensed professional engineer or land surveyor, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the elevation 12 inches above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A licensed professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all floodproofing certifications that includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which each structure has been floodproofed. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a licensed professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  All manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on the FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the FIRM shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufacture home is elevated 12 inches above the base flood elevation as certified by a licensed professional engineer or land surveyor and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A, A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM shall either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of section 23-373(b), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (b)(4) of this section.

g.  Structure is firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
h.  Accessory structures shall not be located within the regulatory floodway. 
i.  Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be provided below the base flood elevation (BFE). 
J.  Structure is to be located so as not to cause damage to adjacent and nearby structures. 
(c)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with section 23-370(b), (c) and (d). 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions shall meet the permit requirements of section 23-373(b) and the provisions of this section. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 23-372(b) or 23-373(b)(8). 
(4)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.

These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flows may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 12 inches above the depth specified on the FIRM or 36 inches above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 12 inches above the depth specified on the FIRM or 36 inches above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified; or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be designed so that below the elevation 12 inches above the base flood level, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A licensed land surveyor or licensed engineer shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(e)  Floodways. Floodways located within the floodplain established in section 23-372(b), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway except for: 
a.  Work for the purpose of constructing, repairing, or maintaining any street, utility facility including any service lines related thereto, or any recreational park facility which when completed results in no adverse impact; and 
b.  Maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities that does not diminish the design capacity of a drainage system. 
(2)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR ch. 1, § 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the developer or community first obtains a conditional FIRM and floodway revision CLOMR through FEMA. 
(3)  If subsection (e)(1) or (2) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements within the floodway shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.

Sec. 23-401. - Airport zones and height and land use limitations. 
(a)  Administration and enforcement. The building official for the city is hereby appointed to administer and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Applicability. No structure or tree shall be erected, nor any use commenced on any land lying beneath the approach, transitional, horizontal, and conical surfaces applicable to the Stillwater Regional Airport except as permitted under the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Airport zone supplemental district. There is hereby established a supplemental overlay district, designated AZ for all property in the city which falls within the airport zones established in subsection (d) of this section. The boundaries of this zone are taken from the Stillwater Regional Airport zoning map and shown on the official zoning map for the city. 
(d)  Airport zones. In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach, transitional, horizontal, and conical surfaces applicable to the city municipal airport. Such zones are shown on the city municipal airport zoning map. An area located in more than one of the following zones shall be considered within that zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Precision instrument runway approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as three-quarter-mile nonprecision instrument approach zone.

Except as specifically provided in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor, shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in as provided in this chapter. Nothing contained in any of the following exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in subsection (e)(7) of this section. 
a.  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal and conical zones, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
b.  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
c.  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
(2)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(3)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the building official deter mines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(4)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for a variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. 
(5)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

ARTICLE XXI. - OIL, GAS AND DISPOSAL WELL REGULATIONS[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3310, § 1, adopted July 20, 2015 , repealed the former Art. XXI, §§ 23-410, 23-411. Section 2 of said ordinance enacted a new Art. XXI as set out herein. The former Art. XXI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 3023, § 1(23.410, 23.411), adopted March 3, 2008. 

Sec. 23-410.1. - Findings of fact; authority. 
A.  Findings . The regulations contained in this article are supported by the following findings of fact: 
1.  Oil and gas drilling and production is an important component of the Stillwater area economy. 
2.  Oil and gas well drilling and production activities create conditions that potentially threaten the health, safety and general welfare of persons residing or working on property in proximity to such operations. 
3.  Oil and gas well drilling and production activities, in the absence of local regulatory controls, may generate noxious aerial emissions, introduce contaminants into groundwater, emit high noise or light levels, produce large volumes of dust, congest local streets, present fire or chemical spill hazards and produce other deleterious effects, all of which fall disproportionately on adjacent land uses, and which can result individually or cumulatively in injury to persons or damage to property and inhibit the quiet peace and enjoyment of the surface uses of real property in the vicinity of such operations. 
4.  The proliferation of oil and gas well pad sites within the city creates conflicts between such development and other existing and future surface uses of real property within the city. To assure the compatibility of residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural uses with oil and gas well development, it is necessary for the city to regulate the location of oil and gas well operations relative to other surface uses of real property within the city consistent with the right of mineral owners to reasonably access subsurface resources. 
5.  The city recognizes that the State of Oklahoma regulates oil and gas well drilling and production activities. The regulations in this article are intended to supplement such standards and additionally implement compatible local measures that assure the health, safety and general welfare of the city's residents and businesses. 
B.  Authority . This article is adopted pursuant to authority vested under the constitution and laws of the State of Oklahoma and the Stillwater City Charter. Each authorization identified in this article shall be construed as an exercise of the city's police, nuisance, and zoning powers pursuant to the Charter and Oklahoma Statutes.

4.  The city council may, upon application, reduce the separation distance set forth in subsection 23-410.6(A) if: 
(a)  The operator demonstrates that due to size or shape alone, said requirement will prevent any oil and gas drilling and production on the A or IG zoned parcel, provided, no such reduction of separation distance shall be granted unless the operator demonstrates that additional or enhanced mitigation measures will adequately offset any increased negative impact to adjoining property caused by the separation reduction; or 
(b)  The operator produces notarized written consent to a separation reduction from each owner of a protected use or platted residential subdivision parcel located within or immediately adjacent to the separation boundary; a notarized written consent to a separation reduction from each owner of an adjoining use other than a protected use; or, a notarized written consent to a separation reduction from each owner of a structure located on the same parcel as the drilling and production site; as applicable. 
5.  No structure shall be constructed within 400 feet of a producing well drilled after the effective date of this article, except with written consent of the well operator. Said distance shall be determined in the same manner as set forth in subsection 23-410.6(A)(3), except that the closest permanent structure located on the production site shall serve as the initial point of measurement. 
B.  On-site requirements. 
1.  All drilling and completion operations proposed within the FEMA One Hundred Year Designated Floodplain shall comply with the adopted Flood Hazard Regulations and shall be fully flood proofed. 
2.  All drilling and production sites shall be screened with an opaque temporary fencing of sufficient size and dimension to secure the area where drilling activities are conducted and to protect adjoining uses from the deleterious effects of noise, light, dust, and other nuisances associated with such activities, consistent with the standards set forth in this Code. 
3.  The ambient noise level shall be 69 dB. No operation conducted on the drilling and production site shall create any noise which causes an exterior noise level when measured at the separation boundary for a protected use that: 
(a)  Exceeds the ambient noise level by more than five decibels during daytime hours and more than three decibels during nighttime hours; 
(b)  Creates pure tones where one-third octave band sound-pressure level in the band with the tone exceeds the arithmetic average of the sound-pressure levels of two contiguous one-third octave bands by five dB for center frequencies of 500 Hertz and above, and by eight dB for center frequencies between 160 and 400 Hertz, and by 15 dB for center frequencies less than or equal to 125 Hertz; or 
(c)  Creates low-frequency outdoor noise levels that exceed the following dB levels: 
16 Hz octave band 69 dB 31.5 Hz octave band 69 dB 64 Hz octave band 69 dB  
(d)  Adjustments to the noise standards as set forth above may be permitted intermittently in accordance with the following: 
Permitted Increase (dBA) Duration of Increase (minutes)* 10 5 15 1 20 Less than 1  
* Cumulative minutes during any one hour. 
(e)  The exterior noise level generated by operations at the drilling and production site shall be continuously monitored for compliance. The cost of such monitoring shall be borne by the operator. If a complaint is received by either the operator or the city from the occupant of any protected use, the operator shall, within 24 hours of notice of the complaint, continuously monitor for a 72-hour period the exterior noise level generated by operations at the drilling and production site at the nearest property line of the source of the complaint. 
(f)  Acoustical blankets, sound walls, mufflers, landscaping or other alternative methods may be used to ensure compliance. All soundproofing shall comply with accepted industry standards and applicable fire codes. 
(g)  The sound level meter used in conducting noise evaluations shall meet the American National Standard Institute's Standard for sound meters or an instrument and the associated recording and analyzing equipment which will provide equivalent data. 
(h)  A citation may be immediately issued for failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection. However, if the operator is in compliance with the approved drilling/completion mitigation plan, and a violation still occurs, the operator will be given 24 hours from notice of noncompliance to correct the violation from an identified source before a citation is issued. Additional extensions of the 24-hour grace period may be granted in the event that the source of the violation cannot be identified after reasonable diligence by the operator. 
4.  Exhaust from any internal combustion engine, stationary or mounted on wheels, used with the drilling of any well shall not be discharged into the open air unless it is equipped with an exhaust muffler or mufflers, or an exhaust muffler box constructed of noncombustible materials sufficient to suppress noise and prevent the escape of noxious gases, fumes, or ignited carbon or soot. 
5.  The operator shall minimize the escape of toxic, noxious or offensive odors, fumes, and emissions from the drilling and production site during drilling and completion operations. Gas emissions shall be shielded from the direction of any protected use located adjacent to the drilling and production site. Air quality at the separation boundary of an adjoining protected use shall meet applicable EPA or ODEQ standards during such operations.

The Production Site shall be screened with an opaque permanent fencing sufficient to secure the area where production activities are conducted and to protect adjoining uses from the deleterious effects of noise, light, dust, and other nuisances associated with production activities, consistent with the standards set forth in this Code. The presumptive minimum height of such fencing shall be eight feet. Provided, however, the minimum height may be reduced if trees or similar vegetation are planted in the separation area between the production site and any adjoining protected use. 
4.  The ambient noise level shall be 69 dB. No operation conducted on the production site shall create any noise which causes an exterior noise level when measured at the separation boundary for a protected use that: 
(a)  Exceeds the ambient noise level by more than five decibels during daytime hours and more than three decibels during nighttime hours; 
(b)  Creates pure tones where one-third octave band sound-pressure level in the band with the tone exceeds the arithmetic average of the sound-pressure levels of two contiguous one-third octave bands by five dB for center frequencies of 500 Hertz and above, and by eight dB for center frequencies between 160 and 400 Hertz, and by 15 dB for center frequencies less than or equal to 125 Hertz; or 
(c)  Creates low-frequency outdoor noise levels that exceed the following dB levels: 
16 Hz octave band 69 dB 31.5 Hz octave band 69 dB 64 Hz octave band 69 dB  
(d)  Adjustments to the noise standards as set forth above may be permitted intermittently in accordance with the following: 
Permitted Increase (dBA) Duration of Increase (minutes)* 10 5 15 1 20 Less than 1  
* Cumulative minutes during any one hour 
(e)  The exterior noise level generated by operations at the production site may be monitored by the city for compliance. If a complaint is received by either the operator or the city from the occupant of any protected use, the operator shall, within 24 hours of notice of the complaint, continuously monitor for a 72-hour period the exterior noise level generated by operations at the production site at the nearest property line of the source of the complaint. 
(f)  Landscaping, sound walls, and other alternative permanent methods may be utilized to mitigate noise emanating from the production site. All soundproofing shall comply with accepted industry standards and applicable fire codes. 
(g)  The sound level meter used in conducting noise evaluations shall meet the American National Standard Institute's Standard for sound meters or an instrument and the associated recording and analyzing equipment which will provide equivalent data. 
(h)  A citation may be immediately issued for failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection. However, if the operator is in compliance with the approved production mitigation plan, and a violation still occurs, the operator will be given 24 hours from notice of noncompliance to correct the violation from an identified source before a citation is issued. Additional extensions of the 24-hour grace period may be granted in the event that the source of the violation cannot be identified after reasonable diligence by the operator. 
5.  Motive power for all production operations shall be by utility-provided electricity. All electric lines to drilling and production facilities shall be located in a manner compatible to those already installed in the surrounding area.

ARTICLE XXV. - CORRIDOR REDEVELOPMENT AREA PLANNING DISTRICT 

Sec. 23-440. - Intent. 
    The Corridor Redevelopment Plan was adopted by the Stillwater City Council on June 4, 2012 (Resolution No. CC-2012-5). The purpose of the plan is to encourage innovative development and re-development in the area immediately south and east of the Oklahoma State University Main Campus (Map 1). This "corridor" historically presents planning challenges because a wide variety of land uses must be contained in a relatively compact geographic area to serve the adjoining university community. 
    The Corridor Redevelopment Plan identifies utilization of "Form Based Codes" (FBC) as an appropriate means to create a built environment that achieves the vision of the Plan. In this context, Form Based Codes: 
 Allow for a mix of land uses 
 Take advantage of compact building design 
 Create a range of housing opportunities and choices 
 Create pedestrian friendly neighborhoods and destinations 
 Foster distinctive, attractive development with a sense of place 
 Preserve open space 
 Strengthen and direct development towards existing infrastructure and destination points 
 Provide a variety of transportation connections 
 Make development decisions predictable, fair and cost effective 
 Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration in development decisions.

(1)  Green indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal, except when prohibited under 47 O.S. § 11-1302, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited; 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection; and 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as provided in 47 O.S. § 11-203, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk; 
(2)  Steady yellow indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter; and 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in 47 O.S. § 11-203, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway; 
(3)  Steady red indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subsections b and d of this subsection; 
b.  Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street after stopping as required by subsection a of this subsection. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection; 
c.  In order to prohibit right turns or left turns as prescribed in subsection b of this subsection, on the red signal after the required stop, a municipality must erect clear, concise signs informing drivers that such turns are prohibited. The highway department shall specify the design of the sign to be used for this purpose, and it shall be used uniformly throughout the state; 
d.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the driver of a motorcycle facing any steady red signal may cautiously proceed through the intersection only if: 
1.  The motorcycle has been brought to a complete stop as required by subsection a of this subsection; 
2.  The traffic control signal is programmed or engineered to change to a green signal only after detecting the approach of a motor vehicle and has failed to detect the arrival of the motorcycle because of its size or weight; and 
3.  No motor vehicle or person is approaching on the roadway to be crossed or entered, or the motor vehicle or person is at a distance from the intersection that does not constitute an immediate hazard. 
The driver of any vehicle approaching the intersection, which lawfully may enter the intersection, shall have the right-of-way over any motorcycle operator proceeding through a red light and, in no event where an accident results from the driver of the motorcycle proceeding into the intersection on a red light, shall such driver of the vehicle be charged with any violation pursuant to 47 O.S. §§ 11-401 and 11-403 relating to failure to yield right-of-way, 47 O.S. § 11-310 relating to following too closely, or 47 O.S. § 11-801, relating to driving too fast for conditions; and 
e.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in 47 O.S. § 11-203, pedestrians facing a steady circular red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(b)  In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

DIVISION 3. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 37-125. - When cut to be permitted. 
    No curb shall be removed or omitted for a driveway entrance except at such location and at such grades as shall be designated by the city engineer and in accordance with the following provisions, nor shall any driveway, pavement, walks, curb, or gutter be cut or altered for repair or installation of subsurface utilities except in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  When any curb or curb and gutter section is removed and is not to be replaced with a similar section, the same shall be replaced, without unreasonable delay, by a complete driveway section in accordance with regulations herein prescribed. The curb opening shall be protected by a slab of Portland cement concrete extending a maximum of five feet behind the face of the curb. The slab shall be laid on the same grade to conform to all provisions as would be required if a complete driveway section was being constructed. In cases where the elevation of private property is below the top of the curb elevation or other unusual conditions exist, the grade of the protective slab shall be as prescribed by the engineering division of the department of operations. 
(2)  When any curb cut, not to be replaced by a similar section or a complete driveway section, is made and will subject any sidewalk to vehicular traffic, the sidewalk so subjected shall be replaced with a standard driveway sidewalk section. 
(3)  When removing curb and gutter that has been constructed as a unit separate from the street surfacing, both curb and gutter shall be removed, provided that the curb only may be removed on any street constructed with a slip-formed curb and gutter dowelled to concrete pavement. When the limit of the section to be removed comes within five feet or less of any expansion or contraction joint, the curb and gutter shall be removed and replaced to the joint. 
(4)  Prior to the removal of pavement for the installation or repair of subsurface utilities, all sides of the proposed cut shall be sawed with an approved concrete saw to a depth of not less than 11/2 inches. Where it is necessary to cut paving for emergency repairs, paving may be removed without sawing, provided any damaged sections of paving are removed prior to making the repairs. After excavating and backfilling have been completed, if it is further necessary to remove additional paving, the sawing process shall be repeated, covering the outer edges of the paving to be replaced. When concrete paving is cut for the purpose of excavating, the cut in the concrete pavement shall be 12 inches wider than the excavation, allowing six inches of undisturbed earth on each side of the excavation. 
(5)  Where a sidewalk is to be removed and replaced, a whole section of the sidewalk at the point involved shall be removed unless the cut is made with a concrete saw. When a sidewalk is cut for the purpose of excavating, the cut in the sidewalk shall be at least 12 inches wider than the excavation, allowing six inches of undisturbed earth on each side of the excavation. 
(Code 1966, § 19-22(a); Code 1982, § 27-81; Ord. No. 2380, § 1, 7-16-1990) 
Sec. 37-126. - Backfill of trenches. 
(a)  All trenches excavated across or along any paved street or alley and across any traveled portion of unpaved streets or alleys shall be backfilled and compacted to the same density, in layers not to exceed six inches in depth, as the existing soil adjacent to the side of the trench, but shall not be less than 90 percent standard Proctor density, provided the excavated materials consist of soil that can be readily compacted at the optimum moisture. 
(b)  If the excavated material consists of a majority of clay or silt and contains an excess of moisture, such excavated material shall be removed from the site of the work and the trench filled with sand; provided, however, that where such trenches are excavated across or along unpaved streets or alleys, a trench shall be filled with sand covered by a layer of soil 12 inches in depth compacted to not less than 90 percent standard Proctor density in layers not to exceed six inches. 
(c)  If the backfilling has been completed and the backfill material does not meet the requirements for compaction, all of the material shall be removed and hauled from the job site and the trenches refilled with material as specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. 
(d)  All trenches excavated along unpaved streets may be backfilled and compacted by flooding, provided that an excessive water pressure is not used and that the method of flooding to be used meets with the approval of the engineering division of the department of operations. 
(Code 1966, § 19-22; Code 1982, § 27-82) 
Sec. 37-127. - Construction of subsurface utilities across and along streets within fire limits, across and along major streets and highways. 
(a)  Where subsurface utilities are to be constructed across or along streets within the fire limits or across or along major streets or highways, plans showing such construction shall be submitted to the office of the engineering division of the department of operations for approval. Any such approval will be based on the following methods of construction: 
(1)  Opening of trenches shall be confined to within 100 feet in front of the completed utility installation. Backfilling shall be started immediately after the installation of the utility. 
(2)  Where utilities are to be constructed across streets as provided in this subsection (a), one of the following methods may be used: 
a.  Tunneling. 
b.  Boring. 
c.  Open excavation with bridges being provided as soon as trench is excavated. 
d.  Open excavation where work can be completed between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., or on weekends from 9:00 p.m., Saturday, until 6:00 a.m., Monday. 
(b)  When an emergency exists and it is necessary for a utility to make an installation, an open cut will be permitted subject to the approval of the engineering division of the department of operations. 
(Code 1966, § 19-22; Code 1982, § 27-83) 
Sec. 37-128. - Driveways and vehicular access. 
    Proper location, spacing, and design of curb cuts and driveways is important to maintain the safety and efficiency of public roadways. The following regulations have been developed to ensure that developments along public roadways will have as minimal an impact as possible on roadway traffic, while still providing each property a means of access: 
(1)  Each lot of record shall have access to a public street, either directly, or indirectly by a private drive or street. Where the sole access to a lot is a private drive or street, such drive shall be reserved by a recorded private easement or common ownership. The entrance onto the public street shall be constructed in accordance with the provisions shown in figure B. Beyond the entrance, a private drive or street shall be paved with a sealed surface pavement which meets the requirements of section 23-211(2), and shall be maintained free of holes, mud, dust, and debris. Private streets and drives are not maintained by the city. 
(2)  No driveway, pavement, or curb, shall be constructed or altered except at such location and to such dimensions and grades as shall be designated and approved by the engineering division of the department of public works and in accordance with these provisions. 
(3)  Excepted as provided in section 37-131(3), all driveways shall be so located that no portion of the drive shall encroach on the frontage of adjacent property. 
(4)  If a proposed subdivision of nonresidential land would result in additional curb cuts being allowed, the applicant shall be required to file joint access agreements of record in the county courthouse to limit the number of driveways to the number available before the subdivision. The applicant may submit a written request for waiver of this requirement to the planning commission at the time of application for a lot split, minor subdivision or preliminary plat. 
(5)  The requirements of section 37-130 do not apply to a driveway which intersects an alley. 
(6)  The amount of lot width shall provide the basis for determining the maximum driveway width allowed as indicated in section 37-129, with the measurement of the width of the lot to be calculated at the property line; with the exception of cul-de-sac lots for which the width of the lot shall be measured at the zoning imposed front building setback line. 
(7)  Regardless of the driveway width utilized, the driveway return radius shall not extend past the property line, except as specifically allowed within section 37-131(7), unless this requirement is waived with just cause by the city engineer and written consent is obtained from the owner of the adjacent lot upon which the radius encroachment will occur. 
(Code 1966, § 19-22(d); Code 1982, § 27-84(A); Ord. No. 2326, § 3, 7-11-1988; Ord. No. 2398, § 1, 1-7-1991; Ord. No. 2527, § 1, 3-4-1996; Ord. No. 2782, § 1, 6-16-2003) 
Sec. 37-129. - Provisions for driveways and vehicular access-Residential. 
    Except as may be provided in an approved PUD plan, or for semidetached single-family dwelling lots, all residential lots under 100,000 square feet in size shall abut at least one public street for at least 35 feet, which street shall provide a direct and primary means of ingress and egress for all dwelling units. In no case shall a residential structure with four or less units be allowed access onto a principal or minor arterial street if access is otherwise available onto either a collector or local residential street. Residential lots containing four or less units along an arterial street where access is not available to a collector or local street, and residential lots with more than four units in all cases, shall be required to comply with the same curb cut size and location standards as nonresidential properties. 
(1)  The basic design standards for residential driveways are shown in figure A, section 37-135. 
(2)  The minimum width for a single car driveway shall be ten feet and for a two or more car driveway 16 feet at the property line. The maximum width for a two or more car driveway shall be 22 feet for lot widths equal to 50 feet and less than 60 feet in width, 28 feet for lot widths equal to 60 feet and less than 75 feet in width, and 32 feet for lot widths equal to and greater than 75 feet as measured at the property line. The following table A provides a quick reference to the maximum residential driveway width permitted by lot width: 
TABLE A. RESIDENTIAL DRIVEWAY WIDTH PERMITTED 
Lot Widths 
(Street Frontage) Maximum Driveway Widths 50 to < 60 feet 22 feet 60 to < 75 feet 28 feet = 75 feet 32 feet  
(3)  Driveways shall be separated from an intersection such that both of the standards in this subsection are met. In no case shall the distance be such that the driveway return radius cuts into the intersecting street return radius. A minimum shall be maintained as follows: 
a.  30 feet between the edge of the driveway at the curbline and the edge of the intersecting street; and 
b.  15 feet between the edge of the driveway and the property line along the intersecting street. 
(Code 1966, § 19-22(d); Code 1982, § 27-84(B); Ord. No. 2326, § 3, 7-11-1988; Ord. No. 2398, § 1, 1-7-1991; Ord. No. 2527, § 1, 3-4-1996; Ord. No. 2782, § 1, 6-16-2003) 
Sec. 37-130. - Same-Nonresidential. 
    The location, number, spacing and design of all driveways and curb cuts for nonresidential uses, and residential uses described in section 37-129 which are to meet the nonresidential standard, shall be constructed according to the following provisions: 
(1)  Separation from intersections. Driveways required to meet the provisions of this section shall be located with respect to intersecting streets on the same side of the roadway as provided in table 1 in this subsection (1). When a proposed driveway is to be located along a roadway opposite a T-intersection, the driveway shall align with the intersecting street or be offset as provided in table 1 and illustrated in figure B. When the driveway is to be offset, the measurement for location of the driveway will be from an extension of the property line adjacent to the intersecting street which is closest to the proposed driveway. For lots with frontage too narrow to meet the separation requirements of table 1 or placement to meet this requirement would result in a hazardous situation, the following criteria will be used to provide access to the lot: 
a.  The applicant shall secure joint access with abutting property to provide the required separation. 
b.  Where it is not possible to utilize joint access, a driveway may be allowed by the city engineer. The city engineer shall establish the location of the driveway for each site based on: 
1.  On-site circulation needs, building setback requirements, and other site constraints; 
2.  The desire to place the driveway as far from the intersection as possible; and 
3.  Other factors relevant to the specific development. 
c.  Driveways onto arterial streets with a separation of less than 150 feet shall be for right turn in and right turn out only. 
TABLE 1. MINIMUM SEPARATION OF DRIVEWAYS FROM STREET INTERSECTIONS* 
Intersecting Street Street with Driveway Local (feet) Collector** (feet) Minor Arterial (feet) Major Arterial (feet) Local 45 65 150 150 Collector 45 65 150 150 Minor arterial 45 85 150 150 Major arterial 45 85 150 150  
*Measurement is from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street to the center of the driveway. 
**These dimensions can be reduced to 20 feet if the collector does not have a center turning lane. 
(2)  Number of driveways. The number of driveways allowed per lot shall be determined based on the amount of lot frontage. Lots fronting on local or collector streets are allowed one driveway for the first 80 feet of frontage, or any fraction thereof. Additional driveways are allowed for each additional 80 feet of frontage (e.g., a property must have 160 feet of frontage to have two driveways). Lots fronting on arterial streets are allowed one driveway for the first 175 feet of frontage, or any fraction thereof. Additional driveways are allowed for each additional 175 feet of frontage (e.g., a property must have 350 feet of frontage to have two driveways). 
(3)  Driveway spacing. To ensure safety of turning movements, all driveways, whether on one property or abutting properties, shall meet the spacing requirements of table 2 in this subsection (3). Where lot frontages are so narrow that meeting this standard would prevent access to individual properties or placement to meet this requirement would result in a hazardous situation, the following procedures will be followed: 
a.  When one or more driveways meeting the requirements of this section can serve the lot, the additional driveway which cannot meet these requirements will not be allowed. 
b.  Where meeting this requirement would mean no access would be allowed to the lot the following procedures will be used to provide access: 
1.  The applicant shall secure joint access with abutting property. 
2.  Where joint access driveways are not possible, driveways not meeting these separation requirements may be approved by the city engineer. In determining where the driveway will be placed, the city engineer will identify those places on the lot where a driveway will have sight distance meeting AASHTO standards and otherwise not be hindered by obstructions and then allow the driveway to be placed in whichever of these areas provide the greatest separation from existing driveways.

Speed (mph) Spacing (feet) 25 65 30 90 35 100 40 120 45 150 50 200  
*Measured along the property line from centerline to centerline of adjacent driveways. 
(4)  Curb cut design. Each driveway and curb cut shall be designed to handle the traffic loads of the associated use and to provide for safe and efficient movement of traffic off of and on to the roadway. 
a.  The basic design standards are illustrated in figure B, section 37-135. 
b.  A driveway shall consist of no more than four lanes. Two-lane driveways shall have one lane in each direction, three-lane driveways shall have no more than two lanes in one direction, and four-lane driveways shall have two lanes in each direction. The need for more than one lane in each direction shall be established by the city engineer based on estimated traffic volumes for the driveway provided by the applicant, the latest traffic counts on the adjacent roadway, and the size and location of the site. The intent is for a given driveway to utilize the minimum number of lanes necessary to adequately serve the use. 
c.  Each lane of a driveway shall be a minimum 12 feet wide and a maximum 15 feet, except for one-way drives which shall be a maximum of 18 feet wide per lane, and drives which primarily serve truck traffic shall be a maximum 20 feet wide per lane. Lane widths shall be measured at the property line. 
d.  The minimum return radius shall be five feet on a local or collector street and 15 feet on an arterial street. There is no maximum radius. Unless part of a joint access driveway, no part of the return radius may extend beyond the property line. In specific cases, based on roadway and driveway traffic volumes and other design considerations, the city engineer may require a specific return radius. 
e.  When more than one lane in one direction is provided, all lanes shall be clearly marked with striping, buttons, curbs, islands, or other device as approved by the city engineer. All striping, islands, curbing, etc. shall be designed in accordance with AASHTO and other accepted transportation engineering standards. When provided, median strips between opposing lanes of traffic shall be a minimum three feet and a maximum ten feet wide. 
f.  To help ensure safe traffic movement each driveway will be reviewed for sufficient throat depth to separate on-street and off-street turning maneuvers. Throat depth is the distance, measured along the centerline of the driveway, from the edge of the roadway to the first on-site intersection or parking space. In determining the appropriate throat depth the city engineer shall consider the use of the property, traffic volumes, overall design of the driveway, and AASHTO or other accepted transportation engineering design standards. 
g.  Deceleration lanes. A primary goal of these regulations is to facilitate efficient traffic movement on public streets. Uses located along arterial streets which have the potential to generate more than 5,000 vehicle trips a day or have a peak hour generation in excess of 500 vehicles in both directions as calculated from the latest edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, shall be required to provide a deceleration lane for traffic making a right turn into the property. This deceleration lane shall be designated based on AASHTO and other accepted engineering standards and approved by the city engineer.

a.  The entry and exit drives are clearly signed; 
b.  Parking spaces are angled to allow parking only in the direction of the designated loop; 
c.  When the driveways onto arterial streets will be separated by less than 50 feet, centerline to centerline, the exit drive will be for right-hand turns only; 
d.  Sight triangle requirements shall not apply to entry only driveways. 
(2)  Automobile service stations, truckstops, drive-in banks, and convenience stores are very car intensive land uses which may require special consideration. Except for intersection separation requirements, modifications to these regulations may be granted by the city engineer for these uses when it has been shown that alternative site arrangements that meet the requirements of this section are not functional. 
(3)  Where joint access drives are utilized, covenants which run with the land shall be filed in the county courthouse ensuring future use of the drive by those properties which contain only part or none of the driveway. 
(4)  Driveways entering streets or alleys not permanently surfaced shall meet the same general requirements as set out for driveways entering paved streets and alleys with the following additional requirements: 
a.  The engineering division of the department of public works may require a gutter two feet wide to be constructed integral with the driveway pavement for the full width of the driveway entrance; or 
b.  The engineering division of the department of public works may require the right-of-way ditch to be replaced by a culvert, provided that the culvert shall be of a size adequate to handle the expected flow of stormwater without damage to street or alley but in no case shall the culvert be less than 15 inches in diameter. Where a culvert is installed, the engineering division of the department of public works may require that the culvert not be covered by permanent surfacing. 
(5)  If paving or general improvements are made to an unpaved street, any concrete work done on the street for a driveway shall be taken up and replaced at the owner's expense to conform to the newly or subsequently established grade. 
(6)  Residential driveways may exceed the width requirements of section 37-129(2) under the following circumstances and be constructed as indicated: 
a.  Driveways serving duplexes with adjoining two-car garages may be constructed up to 48 feet wide. 
b.  A residential lot utilizing a circle drive with two curb openings shall not exceed an aggregate total driveway width at the property line of 42 feet, with no single driveway width to exceed the maximum width otherwise allowed by the lot width. 
c.  A corner residential lot shall be bound by the provisions of subsection (6)b of this section for a circle drive and entitled to an additional third access drive of no more than 22 feet in width if desired as long as the standard separation distance from the street intersection is complied with. 
d.  Driveways fronting on cul-de-sacs or similar eyebrow half-street circles may be constructed up to 28 feet in width, regardless of the width of the lot at the property boundary, as long as the driveway maintains a separation from any adjoining interior property line of at least five feet at the front property line. 
(7)  The requirement that no portion of a driveway shall encroach upon the frontage of an adjacent property may be waived by the city engineer without written consent from the adjacent property owner where the location of a driveway serves a zero lot line single-family dwelling, a cul-de-sac or eyebrow half-circle lot configuration with severe lot line angles to the street, a driveway connection to a private street within a planned development, or in the case of a joint access driveway that requires an entrance return radius in the public right-of-way which extends into the adjacent lot's frontage. 
(8)  If a proposed curb cut or driveway is in general conformance with the minimum standards of this section, but is determined by the city engineer to otherwise constitute a traffic hazard, the permit required by section 37-132 shall be denied. Such decision may be appealed to the board of adjustment. 
(Code 1966, § 19-22(d); Code 1982, § 27-84(D); Ord. No. 2326, § 3, 7-11-1988; Ord. No. 2398, § 1, 1-7-1991; Ord. No. 2527, § 1, 3-4-1996; Ord. No. 2782, § 1, 6-16-2003) 
Sec. 37-132. - Permit required. 
    No person shall cut or remove curbing on, or construct a driveway having access to, a dedicated public street without first securing a permit from the city engineer, who shall determine and approve the appropriate curb cut access within the guidelines of this section, this Code and any other applicable standards.

( Ord. No. 3408, § 8, 7-23-2018 ) 
Sec. 37-206. - Occupancy fees or inspection fee and service charge. 
(a)  Occupancy fees. Except as provided in this section, every occupancy permit holder shall pay an occupancy fee to reimburse the city for the cost of acquiring, maintaining and managing the rights-of-way. The occupancy fee shall be computed in accordance with this section. 
(1)  No later than February 15th of each year, each occupancy permit holder shall submit to the development services department a sworn/certified statement of the number of linear feet of rights-of-way occupied by facilities by the ROW occupant as of January 1st of that same year. 
(2)  No later than February 15th of each year, those ROW occupants who are eligible to make inspection fee and service charge payments as set forth in subsection 37-206(b) may select by filing a written statement of selection with the city clerk whether to make inspection fee and service charge payments as set forth in subsection 37-206(b) or occupancy fee payments as set forth below. A ROW occupant who does not file a written statement during that time period, and who has not previously filed a written statement with the city clerk during that time period in a previous year electing a computation method, shall be deemed to have chosen the computation method to calculate occupancy fee payments. A ROW occupant who, in a previous year, has chosen a particular method and has not filed a written statement of selection with the city clerk in the current year, shall be deemed to have chosen to continue to utilize that computation method utilized in the previous year. 
(3)  Each occupancy permit holder shall be notified of the amount of the fee and the basis on which it was calculated no later than ten working days from the date the statement of linear feet is received by the development services director. Unless the entire annual fee is paid when a payment is first due or otherwise authorized by the director of finance, one-twelfth of the occupancy fee shall be due and payable monthly, on or before the 25th day of each month, commencing on the first day of the calendar month commencing after the date this article goes into effect. The payment shall be made to the director of finance when due and shall be paid into, appropriated and expended from the General Revenue Fund of the City of Stillwater. Upon failure or refusal to pay such fee, the city may, in addition to any other remedies provided in this article, maintain an action against such person, firm or corporation for the amount of such fee and all expenses of collecting same, including reasonable attorney's fees. That occupancy fee shall be established as follows: 
a.  The occupancy fee shall be assessed as a pro rata share recovery rate equivalent to the linear feet occupied in the rights-of-way, at a rate established by resolution of the city council. This occupancy fee does not include manholes or junction boxes. 
b.  The recovery rate per linear foot amount of the occupancy fee will be reviewed by the city manager at least annually using a floating five-year average of the city's cost to provide rights-of-way and adjusted based on the CPI South Region index. In addition to any material the manager deems relevant in establishing the recovery rate per linear foot amount of the occupancy fee, the manager shall file a record of the calculation of the recovery rate per linear foot amount of the occupancy fee with the city clerk. 
c.  In the event an occupancy permit holder or a current franchise holder occupies the rights-of-way by the installation of above-ground facilities or utility poles, an additional occupancy fee of $20.00, per utility pole per year shall be assessed. 
(b)  Inspection fee and service charge. ROW occupants who provide communications services may, in lieu of the occupancy fee set forth in subsection 37-206(a), pay an inspection fee and service charge in an amount equal to two percent of the communications service gross revenues from within the corporate limits of the City of Stillwater, Oklahoma, for each current year, if any. 
    This inspection fee and service charge is to compensate the city for the expenses incurred and services rendered incident to the exercise of its power, supervision, police regulation and police control of the construction and maintenance of lines and equipment in the City of Stillwater. Unless otherwise authorized by the director of finance, this inspection fee and charge shall be due and payable monthly, on or before the 25th day of each month, on the gross revenues of the preceding month, commencing on the first day of the calendar month commencing after the date this article goes into effect, and shall include a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross receipts from sales for communications service, within the City of Stillwater during the period for which the monthly payment is made. The statement and payment shall be made to the director of finance when due and shall be paid into, appropriated and expended from the General Revenue Fund of the City of Stillwater. Upon failure or refusal to pay such fee, the city may, in addition to any other remedies provided in this article, maintain an action against such person, firm or corporation for the amount of such fee and all expenses of collecting same, including reasonable attorney's fees. 
    In the event an occupancy permit holder or a current franchise holder occupies the rights-of-way by the installation of above-ground facilities or utility poles, an additional occupancy fee of $20.00, per utility pole per year shall be assessed. 
(c)  Records inspection. The city shall have the right to audit the ROW occupant's records required to be kept by this article. The city shall also have the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this section. If it is determined that the occupancy permit holder has paid less than 95 percent of the amount due to the city, then the city's expenses related to such audit shall be borne by the occupancy permit holder. Any additional amounts due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice, which shall include a copy of the audit report, to the occupancy permit holder by the city of the underpayment. If re-computation results in additional revenue to be paid to the city, such amount shall be subject to the interest charge described in subsection (d), below. If the audit determines that there has been an overpayment by the occupancy permit holder, the occupancy permit holder shall credit any overpayment against its next quarterly payment. 
(d)  Late fees and interest on late payments. 
(1)  If any occupancy fee payment is not made on or before the required date, the occupancy permit holder shall pay interest computed from such due date at an annual rate equal to one and one-half percent interest per month on the total amount of fees due from the last day of the month such was due, plus a penalty of ten percent of the total amount of the fee due. 
(2)  If any monthly inspection fee and service charge for communications service within the City of Stillwater is not made on or before the required date, the ROW occupant will be charged a penalty of ten percent of the total amount of the fee due. In addition, the ROW occupant shall pay interest computed from such due date at an annual rate equal to one and one-half percent interest per month on the total amount of fees due from the last day of the month such was due. 
a.  If a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross receipts from sales for communications service within the City of Stillwater during the period for which the monthly payment was due is provided within 30 days of the original due date, the interest and penalty will be computed based on that actual amount. 
b.  If a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross receipts from sales for communications service within the City of Stillwater during the period for which the monthly payment was due is not provided within 30 days of the original due date, the amount of the monthly inspection fee and charge will be estimated and billed. 
c.  Adjustments to estimates after receipt of complete and accurate verified statements of all gross receipts will be made at the discretion of the director of finance. 
(e)  No deduction or credit against taxes. The payments required by this section shall be in addition to any and all taxes of a general nature or other fees or charges which an occupancy permit holder shall be required to pay to the city or to any local, state, or federal agency or authority, as required by law, all of which shall be separate and distinct obligations of the occupancy permit holder. The occupancy permit holder shall neither apply nor seek to apply all or any part of the amount of these payments as a deduction or other credit from or against any city taxes or other fees or charges, except as expressly permitted by law. The occupancy permit holder shall not apply or seek to apply all or any part of the amount of any taxes or other fees or charges as a deduction or other credit from or against any of its fee obligations provided in this article, except as expressly permitted by law.

Sec. 37-208. - Appeals. 
    An appeal may be taken to the city manager, or the manager's designee, by any person aggrieved, where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by any person in the enforcement of this article. The appeal shall be presented upon written request to the city manager, or the manager's designee. The city manager, or the manager's designee, shall render a decision within ten working days. A response from the manager or designee shall be made in writing and shall be supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision. Appeal of any decisions made by the city manager, or the manager's designee, shall be made to the city council. 
( Ord. No. 3408, § 8, 7-23-2018 ) 
Sec. 37-209. - Engineering, construction and location standards. 
(a)  Allocation of space in the rights-of-way. The city shall have the power to establish reasonable limitations on the placement of new or additional facilities within specific congested segments of the rights-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of ROW occupants. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the width and physical condition of the rights-of-way, the protection of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, regulatory requirements applying to existing facilities, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public's interest. 
(b)  Underground policy. Facilities may be installed above ground in areas where existing utility facilities are above ground and shall, unless otherwise approved by the development services director, be installed underground in areas where existing facilities are installed underground, subject to all applicable safety codes. The city encourages the sharing of underground and overhead facilities. Leasing of excess space in ducts, conduits and on poles is a matter between interested parties; however, lessees of such physical facilities must still comply with the terms of this article, unless otherwise expressly exempted in this article. Underground facilities shall be placed in such a manner so they can be located by the owner of the facilities or the owner's representative. 
(c)  Location criteria. 
(1)  Corridors. The City of Stillwater Standards assigns specific corridors within the rights-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is now or may in the future be located within the rights-of-way. An ideal cross section is established to identify the lateral and vertical position of each class of potential user. ROW occupants shall have the right to occupy only one corridor or section of each rights-of-way within the vertical zone established for the applicable class of user. Additional corridors in the same portion of the rights-of-way may be granted only upon consideration of future utility uses and a demonstration by the requesting party that its current corridor does not afford sufficient space to install its facilities. All permits issued by the development services director involving the installation or replacement of equipment shall be reviewed as to the proper corridor for the facility. 
(2)  Variance. Any ROW occupant whose facility is located in the rights-of-way in a position at variance with established corridors shall move that facility at its own expense to its assigned position within the rights-of-way no later than at the time of the next reconstruction of the facility or roadway reconstruction which requires utility relocation by the city of the area where the facility is located. This requirement may be waived by the director for good cause shown, upon a written request submitted through the development services director, giving due consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs or hardship to the ROW occupant. 
(3)  Interference. A ROW occupant shall not place any fixtures or equipment where they will interfere with any existing facility. A ROW occupant shall locate its lines and equipment in such a manner as not to interfere unnecessarily with the usual traffic patterns (vehicular or pedestrian) or with the rights or reasonable convenience of owners of property that abuts any rights-of-way. 
(d)  Construction standards. 
(1)  All utilities shall be placed within the rights-of-way according to City of Stillwater Design and Construction Standards, provided that in circumstances where no placement is specified, the following minimum depth of installed facilities and clearances between facilities shall be as follows: 
a.  Twenty-four inches in soil, 
b.  Twenty-four inches below a projected slope from the flowline of a ditch at a three horizontal and one vertical slope, 
c.  Forty-eight inches under a roadway measured from the surface of said roadway to the top of the installation, 
d.  Sixty inches under a stormwater or creek channel design flowline, and 
e.  Cross under all natural gas lines at a depth of 24 inches. 
f.  Maintain vertical clearance between new and city-owned facilities as required by the City of Stillwater Standards. 
g.  Maintain horizontal clearance between new and city-owned facilities as required by the City of Stillwater Standards. 
(2)  Backfilling/testing. Excavations shall be promptly backfilled according to City of Stillwater Standards and the earth shall be restored to original grade to assure no hazard to vehicular, animal or pedestrian traffic. The permittee shall perform all concrete testing, soil analysis, compaction testing and any other testing required by the city to verify compliance with City of Stillwater Standards and this section. All testing shall be conducted by an accredited lab and test reports shall be submitted to the development services department. 
(3)  Pavement cutting. All ROW occupants shall comply with the terms and conditions of Stillwater City Code chapter 37, article III, prior to cutting any pavement. 
(4)  Replacement. The replacement of any sidewalk, any driving surface and the base of any roadway shall comply with requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and City of Stillwater Standards and may require additional removal to the nearest joint in all directions. Unless performed as a privately financed public improvement, this removal and all pavement restoration shall be the responsibility of the transportation and stormwater services department or its assigned contractor at the expense of the ROW occupant. 
(5)  Trenching. A permittee shall not proceed with additional trench work exceeding a maximum of 500 feet of open trench without prior approval of the City. 
(6)  Crossings. All underground crossings of paved roadways and stormwater and creek channels shall be made by a bore method approved by the director of transportation and stormwater services. Any alternate method shall be approved by the director, then submitted to the development services director. Voids and all holes shall be properly grouted. Crossings shall be at approximately right angles to the roadway and in no case shall any facility be placed in any culvert or drainage pipe or within ten feet of a culvert or storm sewer. 
(7)  Erosion. Erosion prevention measures shall be incorporated into all work within the public way. All gutters, ditches and other drainage features shall be maintained free and unobstructed of sediment, dirt and debris. The handling, grading, excavating or moving of excess construction materials or the movement or cleaning of construction vehicles or equipment shall be conducted in such a manner that materials and washout will not be deposited into catch basins, gutters, ditches or areas where runoff may carry materials into any public or private stormwater system. 
(8)  Restoration. A permittee shall restore all disturbed areas to a condition equal to or better than existed immediately prior to beginning work. 
(e)  Dimension and location criteria. Maximum dimensions and location of associated, above ground equipment, including but not limited to junction boxes, duct banks, electric generators, repeaters, antennas, satellite dishes or equipment cabinets, shall meet the following criteria: 
(1)  The "elevation view" shall not exceed 30 square feet without written approval of the development services director. 
(2)  Associated equipment shall not be installed in such a manner so as to obstruct the view of drivers upon or entering a public street. Equipment shall not be placed within any intersection "sight-distance triangle". 
(3)  No equipment, including poles, supporting structures for telecommunication antennas, cables and guy wires, shall be placed so as to obstruct, block, obscure or otherwise interfere with any traffic-control device, fire hydrant, wheelchair ramp or other safety device. Locations with existing or potential traffic signals shall have the overhead vehicle signal face display zones kept clear from wires and cables below a height of 22 feet above the pavement grade. Power lines which require a ten foot separation from other facilities shall be suspended no lower than 32 feet above the pavement grade around intersections with existing or potential traffic signals. This minimum clearance shall not be violated by sagging due to cable elongation. 
(4)  No equipment, including poles, supporting structures for telecommunication antennas, and guy wires, shall be placed so as to obstruct the flow of pedestrian traffic, and in no case result in less than six feet of clear sidewalk. 
(f)  Small cell supporting structure location criteria. The location of any new small cell facility and supporting structures located within any right-of-way shall meet the following criteria: 
(1)  Small cell supporting structures shall be located a minimum of 500 feet from any other small cell supporting structure located on the same side of the right-of-way. This distance shall be measured in a straight line from the nearest point of each supporting structure, located at surface grade. 
(2)  Supporting structures located between any existing utility poles shall be sited equidistant between them, within ten percent variance of the total distance. This distance shall be measured in a straight line from the nearest point of each utility pole, located at surface grade. 
(3)  Small cell facilities and supporting structures shall be set back from any traveling surface or curb no less than eight feet to allow for a six foot sidewalk or trail set back two feet from any traveling surface or curb. 
(4)  Small cell facilities and supporting structures shall be located where there is no encroachment into any existing or planned corner sight triangles or sight line triangles. Supporting structures shall not interfere with any safe sight distances or otherwise block vehicular, bicycle or pedestrian traffic, or conflict with the installation, maintenance, or repair of any public utility. 
(5)  Small cell facilities, including support structures, shall not exceed 50 feet in height measured at grade; provided that in no event shall any small cell facilities including its support structures exceed 110 percent of the tallest existing utility pole located within 500 feet along the same street right-of-way. This distance shall be measured in a straight line from a small cell facility's supporting structure the nearest point of any utility pole, located at surface grade. 
(g)  Traffic control and safety. 
(1)  Any permittee occupying any portion of rights-of-way shall erect a barrier around the perimeter of any excavation and provide any and all traffic-control devices, signs and lights appropriate to the level of complexity of the activity in order to protect, warn and guide the public (vehicular and pedestrian) through the work zone. The manner and use of these devices shall be described within a traffic-control plan in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and approved by the director of transportation and stormwater services. 
(2)  Permittees shall implement each traffic-control plan. All permittees shall at all times comply with all applicable city, state and federal requirements and maintain all devices in good repair. Permittees with open excavations awaiting final restoration shall maintain all devices until the transportation and stormwater services department notifies the permittee in writing that the city or the city's designated contractor is assuming responsibility for traffic control for the paving cut restoration or the permittee has completed his city-approved privately financed public improvement and it has been accepted by the city. 
(3)  Each ROW occupant shall designate a safety officer. The safety officer shall be responsible for safety-related issues affecting both the public and the ROW occupant's field employees and contractors for all job sites within the rights-of-way. 
(h)  Miscellaneous standards. 
(1)  Nuisance. Two years after the passage of this article, any equipment found in the rights-of-way that has not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. If the owner can be ascertained by the appearance of the equipment, then upon 30 days' notice to the owner, or, where the owner cannot be ascertained by markings on the equipment, upon 30 days' public notice published in a newspaper of general circulation, the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including but not limited to abating the nuisance by taking possession of the facilities and restoring the rights-of-way. 
(2)  Identification. The development services director, at the director's discretion, may require any new facility (aerial or underground) installed, replaced or repaired by or for a ROW occupant, after the effective date of this article be permanently identified with the name or logo of the ROW occupant on but not limited to manhole covers, tags, poles, posts and signs. The maximum spacing between poles, posts and signs shall be no less than 500 feet for paved roadways and walkways. All ROW occupants shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all existing facilities shall be marked during the normal course of business. 
(3)  Construction zone identification. Any permittee excavating or obstructing any portion of the ROW shall erect a temporary sign displaying either:

ROW occupants shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature; provided this exception shall not be construed to include financial records necessary to enable the city to determine compliance with ROW occupants' fee payment obligations; provided further this exception shall not be construed to include system maps as set forth in section 37-213(b), below. Subject to open meeting and record disclosure laws of the State of Oklahoma, city agrees to treat any information disclosed by ROW occupants to it on a confidential basis and only to disclose it to employees, representatives and agents that have a need to know or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. The council may inspect the books and records of ROW occupants as necessary to determine compliance with the terms of this article and may compel attendance of witnesses. 
(b)  System mapping. Each ROW occupant shall maintain accurate maps and improvement plans showing the location, size and a general description of all facilities, equipment and service drops installed in the rights-of-way and any power supply sources (including voltages and connections). Facilities and equipment shown shall include, but not be limited to, cables, conduits, electric lines, pipelines, fiber optic cables, electric transformers, gas meters and junction boxes.

Sec. 37-214. - Relocation of equipment and facilities. 
    A ROW occupant or permittee must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently relocate its equipment and facilities in the rights-of-way upon written notification by the city. The development services director shall forward a recommendation upon careful determination of the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the public regarding any such relocation. Such relocation shall include restoring the rights-of-way to the same condition it was in prior to said relocation, in accordance with the terms of this article.

The development services director may recommend such actions in order to prevent interference by the ROW occupant's facilities with: a present or future city use of the rights-of-way; or a capital improvement project funded and scheduled to be undertaken by the city; or an economic development project in which the city has an interest or investment. The development services director may also recommend such actions: when the public health, safety and welfare require it; or when necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of-way, both vehicular and pedestrian; or when aboveground equipment is located in such a manner as to create an obstruction to a driver's line of sight. The ROW occupant may for due cause make application to the development services director for an extension to complete such relocation as required by this section.

Each ROW occupant served with notice in accordance with title 63 Oklahoma Statutes, § 142.6, shall locate and mark or otherwise provide the location of the underground facilities of the operator in such a manner as to enable the excavator to determine the precise location of the underground facilities in advance of excavation.

By accepting an occupancy permit or a rights-of-way construction permit, a permittee or ROW occupant is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city as exist under applicable law to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary for the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. Unless otherwise expressly provided in an occupancy permit or rights-of-way construction permit, any conflict between the provisions of any such authorization and any other present or future lawful exercise of the city's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the city. 
( Ord. No. 3408, § 8, 7-23-2018 ) 
Sec. 37-220. - Severability. 
    If any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this article or any part of it is for any reason found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this article or any part of it.

(c)  Recovery of costs. The city may impose a charge, in addition to any occupancy fee or other compensation authorized by this article or applicable law, to cover the city's costs in excess of the filing fee in considering an application for a transfer of an occupancy permit or a rights-of-way construction permit.

Sec. 37-223. - Exemptions. 
    This article applies, to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law, to all ROW occupants.

(1)  Impose liquidated damages in the amount, if any, provided in the occupancy permit or rights-of-way construction permit, whether per day, incident or other measure of violation.

(2)  Impose penalties pursuant to section 37-225; 
(3)  Reduce the duration of the occupancy permit or rights-of-way construction permit on any basis the city determines is reasonable and affords the ROW occupant reasonable due process; and/or

In addition to or instead of these remedies, the city manager may seek legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(c)  Opportunity to cure. Before initiating a remedy under this section, other than revocation of the occupancy permit or rights-of-way construction permit, the city shall give the ROW occupant written notice of the violations claimed and at least ten working days to correct the violations. 
( Ord. No. 3408, § 8, 7-23-2018 ) 
Sec. 37-225. - Penalties. 
    The city manager shall have the authority to assess penalties against a ROW occupant for failure to comply with the terms of its occupancy permit or rights-of-way construction permit or any other portions of this article. Any such assessment must be provided to the ROW occupant in writing with a notice of violation and provide for a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation, provided that the violation is not a result of inclement weather. If the ROW occupant fails to remedy the deficiency by the end of the ten-day period provided in section 37-224(c), the penalty amounts shall begin to accrue and shall continue to accrue until the date that the deficiency is corrected. 
(a)  For effecting or attempting to effect a transfer without approval: $2,000.00 a day for each violation for each day the violation continues; 
(b)  For failure to supply information, reports or filings lawfully required under the terms of an occupancy permit or ROW construction permit or applicable law or by the city: $500.00 a day for each violation for each day the violation continues; 
(c)  For failure to pay occupancy fees, inspection fees, service charges or other fees imposed by this article: $1,000.00 per day;

DIVISION 2. - GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 41-289. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
(a)  No industrial user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all industrial users of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirement. Furthermore, no industrial user may contribute the following substances to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW): 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the municipal wastewater collection and publicly owned treatment works (POTW), including, but not limited to wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
(2)  Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 11.0, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) or equipment, or endangering city personnel. 
(3)  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) resulting in interference, but in no case solids greater than one-half inch or 1.27 centimeters in any dimension. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with either the publicly owned treatment works (POTW), or any wastewater treatment or sludge process, or which will constitute a hazard to humans or animals. 
(5)  Any wastewater having a temperature greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). 
(6)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through. 
(7)  Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(8)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants. 
(9)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance, a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(10)  Any wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent thereby violating the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Color (in combination with turbidity) shall not cause the treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of the compensation point for photosynthetic activity by more than ten percent from the seasonably established norm for aquatic life. 
(11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except as specifically approved by the pretreatment coordinator in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(12)  Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted industrial wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the pretreatment coordinator. 
(13)  Any sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes. 
(14)  Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the pretreatment coordinator in a wastewater discharge permit. 
(15)  Any wastewater causing the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test. 
(16)  Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the publicly owned treatment works (POTW). 
(b)  Wastes prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW). All floor drains located in process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's pretreatment facility before connecting with the publicly owned treatment works (POTW). 
(Code 1982, § 30-132; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993) 
Sec. 41-290. - Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
    The national categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated.

At his discretion, the pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration based limitations in subsection (a) of this section. 
(Code 1982, § 30-134; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993; Ord. No. 2991, § 2, 4-16-2007) 
Sec. 41-293. - City's right of revision. 
    The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 41-267 or the general and specific prohibitions in section 41-289. 
(Code 1982, § 30-136; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993) 
Sec. 41-294. - Special agreement. 
    The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW). In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13. 
(Code 1982, § 30-137; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993) 
Sec. 41-295. - Dilution. 
    No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Code 1982, § 30-138; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993) 
Sec. 41-296. - Pretreatment facilities. 
    Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in section 41-289 within the time limitations specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the state, or the pretreatment coordinator, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this article. 
(Code 1982, § 30-139; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993) 
Sec. 41-297. - Additional pretreatment measures. 
(a)  Whenever deemed necessary, the pretreatment coordinator may require industrial users to: 
(1)  Restrict their discharge during peak flow periods; 
(2)  Designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers; 
(3)  Relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams; and 
(4)  Such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and determine the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the pretreatment coordinator, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the pretreatment coordinator and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his expense. 
(c)  Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(d)  At no time shall two readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW), or at any point in the publicly owned treatment works (POTW), be more than five percent nor any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. 
(Code 1982, § 30-140; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993) 
Sec. 41-298. - Accidental discharge/slug control plans. 
(a)  The pretreatment coordinator may require any industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The pretreatment coordinator shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a plan or other action to control slug discharges. 
(b)  For industrial users identified as significant prior to November 14, 2005, this evaluation must have been conducted at least once by October 14, 2006; additional significant industrial users must be evaluated within one year of being designated a significant industrial user. 
(c)  For purposes of this subsection, a slug discharge is any discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, including but not limited to an accidental spill or a noncustomary batch discharge, which has a reasonable potential to cause interference or pass through, or in any other way violate the publicly owned treatment works (POTW)'s regulations, local limits or permit conditions. The results of such activities shall be available to the approval authority upon request. 
(d)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a slug discharge. Any industrial user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges.

Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW), the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: 
(1)  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 
(2)  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and 
(3)  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this section need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under section 41-361. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 41-357, 41-359, and 41-360. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of the RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the publicly owned treatment works (POTW), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(Code 1982, § 30-172; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993) 
Sec. 41-366. - Analytical requirements. 
    All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
(Code 1982, § 30-173; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993) 
Sec. 41-367. - Sample collection. 
(a)  The reports required in sections 41-357, 41-359, 41-360 and 41-363 must be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The control authority shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and ensure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(b)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling is authorized by the control authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methodologies may be authorized by the control authority as appropriate. 
(c)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in sections 41-357 and 41-359, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by sections 41-360 and 41-363 of this program, the control authority shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and ensure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

Sec. 41-457. - General provisions. 
(a)  The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the city, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1), for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable criteria (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.491 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public); 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; 
(8)  Any other violation which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(b)  The following procedures will be used for evaluating all industrial user monitoring data to determine whether an industrial user meets the criteria for significant noncompliance: 
(1)  Beginning on the first day of the "pretreatment year" (i.e., that period of time which is considered when compiling the annual pretreatment program status report), the year will be divided into four quarters of three months each. 
(2)  At the end of each quarter, all monitoring data for each industrial user, for the previous six months, will be evaluated to determine whether the industrial users are in significant noncompliance. This evaluation shall include all samples collected in accordance with the discharge permit issued to the industrial user, regardless of who collected the samples. 
(3)  Any industrial user which meets the significant noncompliance criteria for any six-month period shall be cited in the annual pretreatment program status report and published in the paper in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.

DIVISION 9. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 

Sec. 41-520. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
(c)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Code 1982, § 30-206; Ord. No. 2465, 9-3-1993) 
Sec. 41-521. - Noncompliance with general and specific prohibitions. 
    An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 41-289 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

Sec. 41-522. - Bypass. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
(1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
(2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. The term "severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  Allowable bypasses. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Notice to publicly owned treatment works (POTW) of needed or unanticipated bypass. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW), at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass.

Sec. 41-557. - Surcharge costs. 
(a)  For the purpose of this section, the term "normal strength" wastewater means wastewater discharged into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) in which the average concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and/or biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is not more than 200 mg/l, and/or the average concentration of oil and grease is not more than 100 mg/l. 
(b)  In order to recover the cost of treating wastewater above normal strength, the city reserves the right to apply a surcharge to any industrial user identified as discharging wastewater above normal strength. The quantity of BOD and/or TSS, applicable to a surcharge will be calculated as follows: 
P = (C-200) × MG × 8.34 
where: 
P = Pounds of (BOD) (TSS) applicable to surcharge 
C = Concentration of (BOD) (TSS) in mg/l measured in the discharge 
200 = Normal strength of (BOD) (TSS) in mg/l 
MG = Million gallons (to the nearest 1,000 gallons) discharged during the month 
8.34 = Conversion factor 
(c)  The quantity of oil and grease applicable to a surcharge will be calculated as follows: 
P = (C-100) × MG × 8.34 
where: 
P = Pounds of oil and grease applicable to surcharge 
C = Concentration of oil and grease in mg/l measured in the discharge 
100 = Normal strength of oil and grease in mg/l 
MG = Million gallons (to the nearest 1,000 gallons) discharged during the month 
8.34 = Conversion factor 
(d)  There will be no surcharge, nor will there be any reduction in the base level charge, when C is equal to or less than 200 mg/l for BOD and TSS, or equal to or less than 100 mg/l for oil and grease. 
(e)  The sewage from individual residences and establishments known to discharge only domestic wastewater is assumed to be of normal strength and will not ordinarily be analyzed. The wastewater shall be sampled in accordance with section 41-367. The analysis will be carried out in accordance with section 41-366.
