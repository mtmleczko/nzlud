A.  General. The committee, in its sole discretion, may direct trustees to make loans to participants upon the written direction and application of the participant who desires to effect such loan, up to fifty percent (50%) of the vested balance of a participant's accounts. All such loans (1) shall not be made available to highly compensated employees (as defined in Section 414(q) of the Code) in an amount greater than the amount made available to other employees, (2) shall be available to all participants on a nondiscriminatory basis, (3) shall be made available in an amount equal to the lesser of fifty percent (50%) of the borrowing participant's vested benefit in his account or Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), (4) shall bear a reasonable rate of interest which will be established by the committee, (5) shall be secured by the borrowing participant's benefit account balance attributable to his account, (6) shall be amortized and repaid in level payments of principal and interest made not less frequently than monthly over the term of the loan, (7) shall be repaid by payroll reduction while the participant is employed, (8) shall accelerate and be due in full on the date a participant terminates employment with the employer, (9) shall not be less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) in amount; and (10) shall be made upon such other reasonable terms which the committee shall designate, such terms being applied in a nondiscriminatory fashion; provided, in no event shall any loan have a term in excess of five (5) years. There shall not be more than one (1) loan outstanding at any time with respect to a participant. No participant who has borrowed from the plan may make another loan until the previous loan has been fully repaid. Outstanding loans are not subject to refinancing by a new loan. Upon direction by the committee, and subject to subsection C below, the trustees may foreclose upon such participant's interest in his account in the event of default. A loan to a participant, when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans to the participant from the plan and other plans sponsored by the employer, cannot exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), reduced by the excess of the highest outstanding balance of loans from the plan (and all other plans sponsored by the employer) during the one (1) year period ending on the day before the date the loan is made over the outstanding balance of the loans from the plan on the date the loan is made. No distribution of a benefit shall be made to any participant, beneficiary, or the estate of a participant unless and until all unpaid loans made by the plan to such participant together with accrued interest have been paid in full. In determining if any of the foregoing limitations regarding the making of loans to participants, loans made under all other plans (a) sponsored by the employer and (b) qualified under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code will be considered. All costs and expenses of any loan will be charged to the applicable accounts of the participant. 
B.  Establishment of Loan Account. At such time as it is determined that a participant is to receive a loan from the plan, the loan shall be made from the participant's applicable account in the order and precedence indicated hereafter, and such amount shall be deemed to be credited to the participant's loan account with a corresponding debit to occur to his account as of the first day of the month in which such loan occurs: (1) first, an account holding employer contributions, including "rollover contributions" (other than deferred compensation contributions, if applicable); (2) second, an account holding deferred compensation contributions, if applicable; and (3) third, an account holding employer contributions which the employer contributed pursuant to the 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code (government pick-up option). All interest payments to be made pursuant to the terms and provisions of the loan shall be credited to the applicable account in such a manner so that the loan account will reflect unpaid principal and interest from time to time. The earnings attributable to the loan account shall be allocable only to the loan account of such participant and shall not be considered as general earnings of the trust fund to be allocated to the other participants therein as provided herein. Other than for the limited purposes of establishing a separate account for the allocation of the interest thereto, a participant's loan account shall, for all other purposes, be considered as part of his applicable account. 
C.  Foreclosure of Loan Account. The trustees may foreclose upon such participant's interest in his account in the event of default under the loan made to the participant under this section. 
D.  Special Restrictions on Foreclosure. In the event of default under a loan made under this section, foreclosure under the promissory note evidencing such loan and attachment of the participant's interest in his applicable accounts shall occur within a reasonable time following the event of default; provided, with respect to any portion of a loan secured by amounts governed under Section 401(k) of the Code, if applicable, foreclosure on such 401(k) amounts shall not occur until the occurrence of an event described under Section 401(k) of the Code which would otherwise permit a distribution to be made from the plan. 
E.  Establishment of Loan Program. The trustees are authorized and directed to establish a "loan program" (the "loan program") and the trustees are further authorized to delegate to the committee the duties and responsibilities with regard to the implementation of the loan program as adopted by the trustees for and on behalf of the plan. The loan program shall be considered to be a part of this plan for the purposes stated in the loan program. 
F.  Loan Account. The words "loan account" shall mean a participant's separate account established in the event he desires to make a loan from his applicable account as provided in this section.

Section 5-209 - FINAL PLUMBING INSPECTION, TESTING. 
    Final plumbing inspection must be made when all fixtures are complete and before any portion of the system is used. All plumbing work must be tested by the plumber in the presence of the inspector before it is accepted. When it is inconvenient or impractical to test the work at one time, it can be tested in sections, but each new partial test must include all portions of the work tested previously. All roughing in tests must be made in water. For such testing, the iron extension for the soil pipe outside of any foundation wall of the building shall be securely closed, as shall branches, inlets, and all other openings of the work to be tested. The closing of the joints and pipes must be sufficiently tight and strong enough to withstand the pressure of a column of water reaching to the top of the pipe to be tested. The whole system shall be filled with water and run upon the top of the same so as to test roof flushing. The entire system must be free from leakage and defects, and the work shall not be approved by the inspector until the entire system is made tight. Grounds for all fixtures that hang on the wall must be in place the same as proper hangers before inspection is called. Work cannot be approved until the grounds and hangers are in place and seen by the inspector. The inspection of grounds, providing partitions are not in place, will not be deemed an unnecessary call. 
Section 5-210 - CERTIFICATE OF INSPECTION. 
    When the plumbing in any building is completed, the plumber shall secure for the owner of such building a certificate of inspection signed by the plumbing inspector, certifying that the plumbing work has been properly done and inspected and tested as required by the provisions of these rules.

The mayor himself, the health officer, any councilman, or any resident or residents of the city may submit such a statement and request a recommendation to the city council. 
C.  The council shall determine whether or not the alleged nuisance is a nuisance in fact. For the purpose of gathering evidence on the subject, the council shall have power to subpoena and examine witnesses, books, papers and other effects. Before proceeding to abate the nuisance or have it abated, the council shall give notice of a hearing on the proposed abatement to the owner of any property concerned and to any other person alleged or deemed responsible for or to be causing the nuisance, and an adequate opportunity to be heard, if such notice and opportunity for a hearing can be given. Such notice to the owner and other persons concerned shall be given in writing by mail or by service by a police officer if their names and addresses are known; but, if the names or addresses are not known, and the peace, health, safety, morals, or welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the necessary delay, a notice of the hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation within the city. 
D.  If the council finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, it shall direct the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance to abate it within a specified time if the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of the person or persons or public adversely affected would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay.

Such order shall be in writing and may be served personally on the owner or occupant of the premises, or authorized agent thereof, by the health officer or by a policeman, or a copy thereof may be left at the last usual place of abode of the owner, occupant, or agent, if known and within the state. If the premises are unoccupied and the residence of the owner, occupant, or agent is unknown, or is without the state, the order may be served by posting a copy thereof on the premises, or by publication in at least one issue of a newspaper having a general circulation in the city. 
B.  If the order is not complied with, the health officer may cause the order to be executed and complied with, and the cost thereof shall be certified to the city clerk, and the cost of removing or abating such nuisance shall be added to the water bill or other city utility bill of the owner or occupant if he is a user of water from the city water system or such other utility service. The cost shall be treated as a part of such utility bill to which it is added, and shall become due and payable, and be subject to the same regulations relating to delinquency in payment, as the utility bill itself. If such owner or occupant is not a user of any city utility service, such cost, after certification to the city clerk, may be collected in any manner in which any other debt due the city may be collected.

CHAPTER 5 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

Section 12-501 - FINDINGS OF FACT. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the community are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 429, 12/10/80; Ord. No. 490, 3/4/87) 
Section 12-502 - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
7.  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 429, 12/10/80; Ord. No. 490, 3/4/87) 
Section 12-503 - METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; or 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 429, 12/10/80; Ord. No. 490, 3/4/87) 
Section 12-504 - DEFINITIONS. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. The following terms as used herein will mean: 
1.  "Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance; 
2.  "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent (1%) or greater change of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V; 
3.  "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year; 
4.  "Critical feature" means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised; 
5.  "Development" means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations; 
6.  "Elevated building" means a nonbasement building: 
a.  Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and pliers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water; and 
b.  Adequately anchored so at not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood; 
In the case of zones A1-30, A1, A, A99, AO AH, B, C, X, D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the Nation Flood Insurance Program regulations; 
7.  "Existing construction" means for the purpose of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures;" 
8.  "Flood or flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; 
9.  "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" means the official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) related to erosion areas having special hazards which have been designated as Zone A, M, or E; 
10.  "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding); 
11.  "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards; 
12.  "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding; 
13.  "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices; 
14.  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations; 
15.  "Manufactured home" means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For flood plain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles; 
16.  "Mean sea level" means for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which the base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced; 
17.  "New construction" means for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community; 
18.  "Start of construction" means for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include excavation of basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or shed not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure; 
19.  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home; 
20.  "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure either: 
a.  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
b.  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred; 
For the purpose of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places; 
21.  "Variance" means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. For full requirements see section Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations; 
22.  "Violation" means the failure of a structure of other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided; and 
23.  "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, here specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

D.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
E.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
F.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Subsection B of Section 12-514 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter as set out in Section 12-502 herein. 
H.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
I.  Pre-requisites for granting variances: 
1.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
2.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and 
3.  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the costs of flood insurance will commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
J.  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
1.  The criteria outline in Subsections A through I of this section are met; and 
2.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Section 12-517 - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION; SPECIFIC STANDARDS. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Sections 12-506, Paragraph 8 of 12-513 or Subsection D of 12-518, the following provisions are required: 
1.  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Subsection A of Section 12-514 is satisfied; 
2.  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator; and 
3.  Manufactured homes are required to be placed within zone A, and shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with Paragraph 1 of Section 12-517.

a.  The showing of such signal color following green shall constitute a warning that the "Red" or "Stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter; and 
b.  Vehicles facing the signal shall stop before entering the near side crosswalk or at the limit line, if it is marked, unless the vehicle is so near the limit line when the "caution" signal first flashes that a stop cannot be made in safety, in which event vehicles may proceed cautiously through the intersection and clear the same before the "red" signal flashes; 
3.  Red alone, "Stop": 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the crosswalk and shall remain standing until green or "go" is shown alone. Except where official signs are erected prohibiting such turns, vehicles in the right traffic lane, after making a full stop as required, may enter the intersection cautiously and make a right turn, but such vehicles shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrians or other traffic in the intersection and the turn shall be made so as not to interfere in any way with traffic proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street; and 
b.  Pedestrians facing the signal shall not enter or cross the roadway when such movement interferes with traffic proceeding on a green signal indication on the cross street, or when the movement cannot be made in safety. No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or "go" is shown alone unless authorized to do so, by a pedestrian "walk" signal; 
4.  Steady red with green arrow: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing such signal when in the proper traffic lane may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. If the movement indicated by the green arrow is a left turn, the left turn shall be made only on the red with green arrow signal; and 
b.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or "go" is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "walk" signal; and 
5.  Green arrows alone. Whenever vehicular traffic movements are controlled by green arrows alone and not displayed with any other signal indication, vehicles facing such signals may make the movements indicated by the green arrows and the movements shall be made only when the green arrows are displayed.

2.  "Steady yellow alone": 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red of "Stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such vehicular traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection or pass the signal when the red or "Stop" signal is exhibited; and 
b.  No pedestrian shall enter the roadway or intersection on which the signal controls vehicular traffic until steady red alone is shown;

SECTION 14
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
14.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
The planned unit development, herein referred to as PUD, is a special zoning district category that provides an alternate approach to conventional land use controls. The PUD may be used for particular tracts or parcels of land that are under common ownership and are to be developed as one unit according to a master development plan. The PUD is subject to special review procedures, and once approved by the City Council, it becomes a special zoning classification for the property it represents.
14.10 INTENT AND PURPOSE
The intent and purpose of the planned unit development provisions are to:
A. Encourage innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitations on the character and intensity of use, assuring compatibility with adjoining and proximate properties, and following the guidelines of the comprehensive plan;
B. Permit flexibility within the development to maximize the unique physical features of the particular site;
C. Encourage efficient use of land, facilitate economic arrangement of buildings and circulation systems, and encourage diversified living environments and land uses;
D. Achieve a continuity of function and design within the development and to encourage diversified living environments and land uses; and
E. Provide a vehicle for negotiating modifications in standard development requirements in order to both encourage innovative development and protect the health, safety and welfare of the community.
14.11 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT AUTHORIZED
A PUD may be authorized by an amendment to the Official Zoning Districts Map after public hearings by the Planning Commission and City Council, provided it complies with the following requirements:
A. Locations and Uses. A PUD shall be considered a special zoning districts; and it may be authorized for any use or combination of uses permitted in this chapter.
B. Planned Unit Development Master Plan Required:
1. The basis for review and approval of a PUD application shall be the PUD master plan, which shall be adopted as a part of the ordinance of rezoning in conformance with the requirements described in these regulations.
2. For a Simplified PUD, the PUD master plan shall be the Simplified PUD application to be provided by the Building Inspector. A Simplified PUD is one which complies with the following:
a. It is for a single tract or parcel or land that is no more than two (2) acres in size; and
48
b. It is governed by the regulations of only one conventional zoning district; and
c. The use regulations of the conventional zoning district are modified only to decrease, not increase, the number of allowed uses (permitted, conditional, special exception and special permit uses); and
d. The development regulations of the conventional zoning district are modified only to make them more restrictive, not less restrictive.
A site plan may be required by the Building Inspector, if it is deemed necessary to effectively review the application.
For all other PUDs, the PUD master plan shall consist of two (2) elements, the design statement and the master development plan map.
C. Effect of Planned Unit Development Approval:
1. Approval of a zoning change to PUD adopts the master plan prepared by the applicant and reviewed as a part of the application. The master plan establishes new and specific requirements for amount and type of land use, residential densities, development regulations and location of specific elements of the development, such as open space and screening.
2. The PUD classification replaces any previous zoning district classification of a parcel.
3. Where there is no provision in the PUD master plan for special development regulations, the requirements of the most restrictive conventional zoning district in which a proposed use or a structure is permitted shall be applied to the development.
14.12 CRITERIA FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND APPROVAL
A. Purpose. Because the PUD provides the opportunity for higher densities, greater design flexibility, mixed land uses, and improved marketability, the applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and services that might not be required or possible in a conventional development. Review and approval of a PUD is, therefore, a process of negotiation between the City government and the applicant to achieve the intents and purposes of these regulations and the comprehensive plan. The following factors should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a PUD application. Other factors not listed herein may also be considered in the review process in order to respond to specific design and land use proposals.
B. Design Standards:
1. The proposed PUD shall be designed to provide for the unified development of the area in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the comprehensive plan and the land uses and zoning districts adjacent to it.
2. Design of the PUD may provide for modification of conventional zoning ordinance requirements for such elements as yard areas, densities, setback, and height on individual lots in accordance with the PUD master plan.
49
3. Density, land use, and intensity of use requirements shall be based on the PUD master plan and shall be reviewed carefully for conformance to the comprehensive plan.
4. Building code requirements shall not be reduced in the design of a PUD.
5. The maximum number of dwelling units within a PUD shall be based on calculation of gross density. Gross density shall be established in the PUD master plan and shall be calculated by dividing the total land area to be developed for residential uses (exclusive of arterial streets) by the number of dwelling units.
6. Location and type of housing shall be established in a general pattern and shown on the master development plan map.
C. Minimum Design and Construction Standards for Streets and Alleys. Streets and alleys for both urban and non-urban PUD's shall be designed and constructed in accordance with City standards and specifications for right-of-way width, curbs, gutters, paving and paving cross sections; provided that modifications may be requested and approved as a part of the master plan if the following criteria are met:
1. Public Streets and Alleys. Proposed public street and alley modifications shall satisfy the following criteria:
a. Street right-of-way and paving widths shall be adequate to provide a traffic carrying and utility installation capacity related to the design of the overall street system, the function of the individual street, and the land uses served.
b. Paving cross sections shall be designed to be adequate to provide acceptable drainage in conformity with the drainage plan for the PUD; to receive loading commensurate with anticipated traffic based on the design of the overall street system; and to have a maintenance level commensurate with that of facilities constructed to regular standards.
2. Private Streets and Alleys. Proposed private street and alley modifications shall satisfy the criteria for public facility modifications listed above and the following:
a. Private streets shall not be connected to an adjacent parcel which is not a part of the PUD in a manner that will circulate traffic into and through the private street system.
b. The owner/applicant shall clearly demonstrate the existence and capabilities of a property owners association to provide the ongoing and long term maintenance of the private street and alley facilities that will not be provided by the City.
D. General Design and Development Guidelines:
1. Densities. Proposed residential densities should conform to density guidelines in the comprehensive plan and should be allocated in a manner and at a scale that will be compatible with adjacent developed neighborhoods.
50
2. Amenities. Amenities should be considered as an important justification for development and City approval of a PUD. Where gross or net densities are to be increased to promote economy of development, or where other methods of land use intensification are proposed, usable open space should be furnished along with provision for its permanent retention and continued maintenance. Sidewalks and pedestrian ways should be planned where it is necessary to provide for amenity and public safety.
3. Streets:
a. Street design should be innovative and should restrict through traffic from residential areas as much as possible.
b. Encouragement should be given to design of short local streets serving limited areas, such as the residential cul-de-sac. Reduction of conventional minor street design widths should be considered appropriate on such streets, when they are designed with limited length and only one access point.
c. Reduction of design widths on streets designed in a conventional pattern should not be approved.
d. Development of a private street system should be considered appropriate under certain conditions where there is no through traffic. However, a private street system should not serve as a reason for reduction of minimum design and paving standards.
e. On-street parking bays or other similar areas where vehicles must be backed into the traffic flow should not be approved on arterial or collector streets or any local street; provided, however, that certain cul-de-sac or small loop street designs may be considered as appropriate.
4. Relationship to Abutting Uses:
a. The master development plan map should show graphically the treatments that will be employed to separate the PUD from abutting properties, including commitments to landscaping, screening, earth berms, or similar techniques.
b. It is appropriate to specifically establish areas with height limitations where a transition to more intense uses is proposed or where a higher intensity development is proposed to abut a lower intensity area.
5. Mixed Land Use Developments. Where a PUD proposes a mix of uses which would generally be incompatible with a conventional development, the PUD master plan should specifically establish appropriate guidelines to assure a harmonious development.
6. Common Access. In commercial or industrial developments, the PUD master plan should establish specific standards and locations for common access driveways both within the development and abutting arterial streets. Approval of the bonus provisions in this chapter for shared parking facilities should only be authorized in a PUD where this access commitment is provided in the PUD master plan.
51
14.2. PUD APPLICATION AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
14.20 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
A. The developer of a PUD shall follow a five-step application and review procedure:
1. Optional pre-application review.
2. Application for rezoning, submission of PUD master plan, including the design statement and master development plan map.
3. Preliminary plat, where required by the subdivision regulations.
4. Final plat, where required by the subdivision regulations.
5. Application for building permit and site plan review.
B. Each required step shall be completed and approved before the following step is reviewed. Where appropriate, other methods authorized in the subdivision regulations may be substituted in Steps 3 and 4 above. The Planning Commission and City Council may, however, review more than one step at the same public hearing. The final plat however, shall be considered at a separate hearing.
C. Public Hearings:
1. Public hearings shall be held on the application for rezoning and the PUD master plan in accordance with regular procedures for zoning applications established in Zoning Ordinance.
2. Public hearings on required plats shall be held in accordance with regular procedures established in the Zoning Ordinance and in the subdivision regulations.
14.21 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES
A. Step 1. Pre-Application Review. Prior to submission of an application for rezoning to a Planned Unit Development, the applicant should discuss with the Building Inspector the procedure for adopting a Planned Unit Development and the requirements for the general layout of major roadways and utilities, access to arterials, or general design and narrative, the availability of existing services, and similar matters. The Building Inspector shall also advise the applicant, where appropriate, to discuss the proposed Planned Unit Development with those officials who must eventually approve the various aspects of the proposal coming within their jurisdiction. The intent of the pre-application review is to expedite the mandatory design review process and to facilitate the approval of a PUD master plan.
B. Step 2. Application for Rezoning and PUD Master Plan.
1. The PUD application for rezoning submitted with a request for annexation or otherwise shall be filed in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance and on application forms of the City of Guymon. The PUD master plan, which is submitted with the application for rezoning, shall consist of a design statement and a master development plan map. The applicant shall also provide other supporting maps as necessary to meet the submission requirements of this section.
52
a. The master development plan map shall be a graphic representation of the development plan for the area, prepared at a scale appropriate for the size of the project but no less than the minimum required for preliminary plats in the subdivision regulations. The purpose of the map is to conceptually portray the development commitments described in the PUD design statement. It is not a requirement that the map show such items as subdivision lines, location of specific structures, or exact location of streets. The complexity of the map information will depend upon the number and extent of varied land uses in the PUD. A single-use PUD, for example, should require less graphic information than a mixed use proposal, and it may be sufficient to outline and identify those general areas where conventional zoning district regulations will be utilized. The map shall show the following:
1. Location of proposed land uses and residential densities;
2. Location of collector streets within the PUD and adjacent arterial streets;
3. Sufficient surrounding area to demonstrate the relationship of the PUD to adjoining uses, both existing and proposed;
4. Location and approximate size of proposed open space and recreation areas;
5. Areas where access to streets will be limited, and location of driveways where appropriate;
6. Any other pertinent information necessary for review, approval, and administration of the PUD.
b. The PUD design statement shall be a written report submitted as a part of the PUD master plan containing a minimum of the following elements:
1. Title of the PUD;
2. List of the owners and/or developers;
3. Statement on the general location and relationship to adjoining land uses, both existing and proposed;
4. Description of the PUD concept, including an acreage or square foot breakdown of land use areas and densities proposed, a general description proposed, a general description of building use types, proposed restrictions, and typical site layouts;
5. The existing PUD zoning districts in the development area and surrounding it;
6. A list of all special development regulations or the conventional zoning district regulations which will be applicable; plus a list of requested variations to the subdivision regulations or other applicable development regulations;
7. A statement on the existing and proposed streets, including right-of-way standards and street design concepts;
53
8. The following physical characteristics: elevation, slope analysis, soil characteristics, tree cover, and drainage information;
9. A topographic map with minimum two (2) foot contour intervals;
10. Drainage information, including number of acres in the drainage-area and delineation of applicable flood levels;
11. A statement of utility lines and services to be installed, including which lines will be dedicated to the City and which will remain private;
12. The proposed densities, and the use types and sizes of structures; and
13. A description of the proposed sequence of development.
2. Upon final approval by the City Council of the PUD master plan and the appropriate ordinance of rezoning, these elements shall become a part of the Official Zoning Districts Map. The ordinance of rezoning shall adopt the PUD master plan by reference, and it shall be attached to said ordinance and become a part of the official records of the City of Guymon.
3. The PUD master plan shall control the use and development of the property, and all building permits and development requests shall be in accord with said plan until it is otherwise amended by the City Council. The developer shall furnish a reproducible copy of the approved master development plan map for signature by the Chairman of the Planning Commission, the Mayor, and acknowledgement by the City Clerk. The PUD master plan, including the signed map and all supporting data, shall be made a part of the permanent file and maintained by the City Clerk.
C. Step 3. Preliminary Plat. Upon approval of the PUD master plan and the ordinance of rezoning, the developer shall prepare a preliminary plat for the entire development area. Where a recorded plat exists and where there will be no extensive easements, no property owners association, no plat restrictions, and no sale of lots which do not conform to the platted lot lines, the Planning Commission may waive the platting requirement.
D. Step 4. Final Plat:
1. Where a subdivision plat has been required, the developer shall prepare a final plat for review, approval, and filing of record according to procedures established by the City Council. In addition to these procedures the final plat shall include:
a. Provisions for the ownership and maintenance of common open space. Said open space may be dedicated to a private association or to the public provided that a dedication to the public shall not be accepted without the approval of the City Council.
b. A homeowners or property owners association shall be created if other satisfactory arrangements have not been made for improving, operating, and maintaining common facilities, including private street drives, service and parking areas, and recreation areas.
54
c. Covenants shall be submitted to reasonably insure the continued compliance with the approved PUD master plan. In order that the public interest may be protected, the City of Guymon shall be made a beneficiary of the covenants. Such covenants shall provide that the City of Guymon may enforce compliance therewith.
E. Step 5. Site Plan. A site plan shall be submitted upon the application for a building permit and reviewed in accordance with procedures established in the Zoning Ordinance.
14.22 PUD REVIEW, APPROVAL AND MODIFICATION
A. Design Review Process Mandatory:
1. At Step 2, all Planned Unit Development applications shall be reviewed through the design review process. Upon receipt of a completed application and application fee for PUD master plan review, the Building Inspector shall transmit the application and all supporting material to the various City departments involved with the design review process and to appropriate officials or agencies of city, county, adjoining counties or municipalities, school and special districts, and other official bodies as deemed necessary or as mandated by law, including any review required by regional or State bodies under applicable State or Federal law. Each participant shall consider all pertinent information, and shall provide the Building Inspector with a certified report of their findings, comments, and recommendations. The certified reports shall be transmitted to the Building Inspector within a period of time that shall permit the applicant to receive a design review report certified by the Building Inspector within fifteen (15) days following the acceptance of the application. A copy of said Report will be entered into the project file. The Report or revisions thereto shall also be forwarded to the Planning Commission with the application of PUD master plan and rezoning approval.
2. The certified design review report shall advise the applicant whether or not significant changes or modifications should be made to the PUD Master Plan application prior to the proposals consideration by the Planning Commission. The applicant may elect to present the application to the Planning Commission without modification.
3. This process shall conform to the plat review process in the subdivision regulations. Where a preliminary plat and a PUD master plan are submitted together they may be reviewed concurrently.
B. Public Hearings. Public hearings by the Planning Commission shall be required prior to approval of Step 2, Step 3 and Step 4. Notice shall be provided in accordance with regular procedures established in the Zoning Ordinance.
C. Administrative Approval of Minor Amendments:
1. The Building Inspector shall be permitted to approve minor amendments and adjustments to the PUD master plan provided the following conditions are satisfied:
a. The project boundaries are not altered.
b. Uses other that those specifically approved in the PUD master plan are not added. Uses may be deleted but not to the extent that the character of the project is substantially altered.
55
c. The allocation of land to particular uses or the relationship of uses within the project are not substantially altered.
d. The density of housing in not increased more than ten (10) percent or decreased by more than thirty (30) percent.

j. The circulation system is not substantially altered in design, configuration or location.
k. The design and location of access points to the project are not substantially altered either in design or capacity.
2. The Building Inspector shall determine if proposed amendments to an approved master development plan satisfy the above criteria. If the Building Inspector finds that these criteria are not satisfied, an amended PUD master plan shall be submitted for full review and approval according to the procedures set forth in these regulations.
3. Any amendments or adjustments to the PUD master plan must be approved in writing by the Building Inspector.
14.23 REVERSION:
Property Owner Request. If the property owner determines to abandon the PUD concept and nullify the PUD master plan, he shall make application for rezoning either to the original status or to a new classification. Said application shall be heard according to regular procedures by the Planning Commission and City Council.
14.24 REVIEW:
Continuing Review by City. If development of the PUD was not been started within three (3) years of the date of approval of the PUD master plan, the Building Inspector shall request a report from the applicant/owner to determine the status of the project. Such additional requests may be made as necessary.
