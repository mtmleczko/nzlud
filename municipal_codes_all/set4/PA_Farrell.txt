ARTICLE I GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Section 101: Short Title 
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as The Mercer County Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. 
Section 102: Authority and Purpose 
This Ordinance is adopted: 
1. 	
To promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare; 

2. 	
To assure that the arrangement of each subdivision or land development furthers the safe, harmonious and orderly development of Mercer County. 

3. 	
To guarantee that the streets in and bordering each subdivision or land development are coordinated with the municipal circulation system and are of such widths, grades, locations and construction as to accommodate anticipated traffic and facilitate emergency service access; 

4. 	
To insure that the sewage disposal and water supply systems are efficiently designed and have adequate capacity, and that on-lot sewage disposal and water supply systems are safely separated from each other; 

5. 	
To provide easements of adequate size and location for storm drainage and other utilities; 

6. 	
To safeguard land subject to flooding, periodic high water table, or high incidence of erosion from the development practices that would aggravate these circumstances; 

7. 	
To curtail unnecessary destruction of natural plant materials or excessive earth disturbance, minimize the impact of stormwater run-off on drainage ways and downstream properties and to prevent destruction of valuable wetland areas and farmland; 

8. 	
To encourage development that relates naturally into its environment; 

9. 	
To establish a precise, simple, uniform and objective procedure for review and disposition of subdivisions and land development plan proposals, and to ease the process of conveyance of title to property, and; 

10. 
To carry out the Mercer County Comprehensive Plan. 


Section 103: Application and Scope of Regulations 
1. 	
On and after the effective date of this Ordinance, no lot in a subdivision may be sold or leased, no permit to erect or move any building upon land in a subdivision or land development plan may be issued, and no building, permanent or temporary, may be erected in a subdivision or land development plan unless and until a subdivision plan or a land development plan has been approved in accordance with the requirements of this 

Ordinance and until the improvements required by this Ordinance, if part of the approved plan, have either been constructed or guaranteed by bond. 

2. 	
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance are held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. 

3. 	
This Ordinance shall not apply to any lot or lots, subdivision, or land development plan created and lawfully recorded prior to enactment of this Ordinance. However, any lot, subdivision, or development plan illegally recorded or not lawfully recorded prior to enactment shall not be given legal status by the enactment of this Ordinance. 

4. 	
Any redivision or combining of lots or adjustment of lot lines within a subdivision plan previously approved and/or recorded, or any rearrangement of structures, parking areas, access points, graded land surfaces, or other elements within an already approved land development plan, shall be subject to the provisions of this Ordinance. 


Section 104: Jurisdiction of the Mercer County Regional Planning Commission Relative to this Ordinance 
1. 	
In accordance with the provisions of Article V and Section 501 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, the County of Mercer, acting through the Board of County Commissioners, does hereby designate the Mercer County Regional Planning Commission as the agency for the acceptance, review and/or approval of all subdivision and land developments within the County of Mercer, and to have related authorities and responsibilities as specified in this ordinance. 

2. 	
All subdivisions of land and land developments, except as noted in number three (3) below, within Mercer County are regulated by the Mercer County Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. It shall not be lawful to record any plan required to be approved by the Planning Commission in any public office unless the same shall bear, thereon by endorsement, the approval of the Planning Commission. The disapproval of any such plan by the Planning Commission shall be deemed a refusal of the privilege to record said plan. 

3. 	
The rules and regulations governing subdivision and land development, as herein outlined, shall not be applicable in those municipalities that have a locally adopted subdivision and land development ordinance in accordance with Article V of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. 

4. 	
Applications for subdivision and land development located within a municipality having adopted a subdivision and land development ordinance as set forth in Article V of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code shall be forwarded upon receipt by the municipality to the Planning Commission for review and recommendations. Such municipalities shall not approve such applications until the Mercer County Regional Planning Commission’s review is received or until the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date the application was forwarded to the Planning Commission. 

5. 	
The rules and regulations governing subdivision and land development, as herein outlined, shall be applicable in those municipalities that have not adopted a subdivision and land development ordinance, and including those municipalities having adopted a 


local zoning ordinance or other adopted ordinance. Provided, however, that where differences occur between the standards of the Mercer County Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance and the standards outlined in the local zoning ordinance or other regulations relative to building development or infrastructure, the standards of such local ordinance shall apply. All other standards, as herein outlined, and not provided for within the local zoning ordinance shall be applicable. 
Section 105: Types of Subdivisions and Land Developments Governed by this Ordinance 
105.1: Minor Subdivision: A subdivision may be classified as a minor subdivision provided that all of the following criteria are met: 
1. 	
The subdivision contains not more than ten (10) lots, parcels, or other divisions of land, including residual land. 

2. 	
The proposal does not involve the construction, installation, or extension of any public facilities including streets, walkways, water and sewer lines, stormwater management facilities, and related facilities, whether intended for public or private ownership. 

3. 	
The proposal does not constitute a subdivision or re-subdivision of any lot, tract, parcel, site, or other division of land or portion thereof that had received previous approval as a subdivision within ten (10) years prior to the submission of the application, and where the cumulative effect of combining said current and prior subdivisions would result in a subdivision not meeting the criteria of this section.  If such prior approval has taken place, all applications shall be considered a single application for purposes of classification. 


105.2: Major Subdivision 
Any subdivision that does not qualify as a minor subdivision. 

105.3: Mobile Home Park 
Shall be considered a parcel (or contiguous parcels that have been consolidated) of land that has been so designated and improved that it can accommodate two (2) or more mobile home lots for the placement thereon of mobile homes. 

105.4: Recreational Vehicle Park 
Shall be considered a plot of land upon which two (2) or more recreational vehicle sites are located, established, or maintained for occupancy by recreational vehicles of the general public as temporary living quarters for recreation or vacation purposes. 

105.5: Land Developments 
Certain land developments, as described by and in this Ordinance and the Municipalities Planning Code, are land developments and are regulated by Article V of this Ordinance. 

105.6: Lot Combination or Un-Subdivision 
Lot combinations shall be considered the act of eliminating an existing subdivision by combining lots or parcels of land into one (1) deed describing the entire tract as one lot or parcel. 
Section 106: Legal Standing 
1. 	
If any section, clause, paragraph, regulation, or provision of this Ordinance is found invalid by a court of law, such judgment shall not affect, impair, invalidate, or nullify the remaining sections, clauses, paragraphs, regulations, or provisions. 

2. 	
All ordinances or parts of ordinances or regulations in conflict with this Ordinance or inconsistent with its provisions are hereby repealed to the extent necessary to give this Ordinance full force and effect. However, where another ordinance, law, or regulation imposes a higher standard in a particular regulation, that standard shall supersede this Ordinance in the particular instance. 

3. 	
The adoption of this Ordinance does not make legitimate development activity in the County illegal under provisions of prior regulations, nor does it annul any litigation currently being pursued in the future against such illegal activity. 

4. 	
The approval of any subdivision plan or land development shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the County or by any official or employee of the practicality or safety of the arrangement of lots and improvements or other elements within the development covered by the approval and shall create no liability upon the County, its officials, or employees. 

5. 	
Approval of any subdivision plan or land development is only approval of the specifications and regulations governed by this Ordinance. 


Section 107: Unlawful Recording or Sale of Lots 
1. 	
No plan of a subdivision or land development proposed within Mercer County shall be recorded in any public office unless or until that plan has been approved or reviewed by the Mercer County Regional Planning Commission, and shall bear the proper certification of such action. 

2. 	
It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, trade, or otherwise convey any lot, parcel, or tract of land as part of, or in conformity with, any plan, plat, or replat of any subdivision or land development unless and until said plan, plat, replat, or land development shall have been first recorded in the office of the Mercer County Recorder of Deeds.

ARTICLE III PROCEDURE FOR SUBDIVISION PLANS 
Section 301: Purpose 
The purpose of this Article is to establish the procedure for Planning Commission review and action on applications for subdivision plans. The procedure is intended to provide for the orderly and consistent processing of such applications. 
Section 302: General 
In order to make the most of the opportunities related to the subdivision and to conserve time, effort and expense, the owner or subdivider should consult with the Planning Commission, the Municipal Engineer and other relevant public officials prior to the preparation of the preliminary plan of the subdivision. This informal review should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions. Requirements for thoroughfares, streets, possible school and recreational sites, shopping centers, community facilities, sanitation, water supply and drainage, and relationship to other developments existing and proposed in the vicinity should be determined in advance of the preparation of the subdivision plan. A thorough estimate of the situation will result in sound decisions with respect to the form, character and intent of the proposed subdivision. 
Section 303: Pre-Application Conference and Sketch Plan 
For the purposes of providing an early exchange of information between a subdivider and the Planning Commission, promoting a mutual understanding of the character of a development and the applicability of this Ordinance, and expediting the application and review process, the subdivider or the Planning Commission may request a pre-application conference.  At the mutual consent of both parties, the subdivider may appear before the Planning Commission or meet with its staff. At the pre-application conference, the subdivider shall present the following: 
1. 	
Sketch Plan: A rough drawing of a proposed subdivision plan of sufficient accuracy to be used for the purpose of discussion and applicability of this Ordinance.

Section 403: Density and Lot Standards 
In the event a municipality has adopted a zoning ordinance or other developmental regulations, the lot and density standards provided for in such ordinance will take precedence over this Section. However, in the absence of such a zoning ordinance or other developmental regulation, and to provide for sufficient light, air, access, orderly design in consideration of the availability of water and sewage facilities, and freedom from hydrologic, geologic, or topographic hazards, all subdivisions shall be designed in conformance with this Section to determine maximum residential density. 
403.1: Non-Buildable and Constrained Lands 
Within a proposed subdivision, certain lands shall be considered non-buildable or constrained and shall not be considered as part of the net lot area used to determine if lots meet minimum lot area requirements. 
1. 	Non-Buildable Areas: The following areas are regarded as non-buildable areas: 
a. 	
Overhead utility line ROWs: All land within the rights-of-way of existing or proposed overhead utility lines.

1. 	
1.00 times the area of overhead utility line ROWs, floodways, and open water; and 

2. 	
0.80 times the area in steep slopes; and 

3. 	
Either 0.50 times the area in floodplains, or, where a floodway is not designated, 0.75 times the area in floodplains. 



403.3:  Lot Requirements 
1. 	
The following table specifies minimum requirements for all proposed lots: 

2.

3. 	
Residual Land: In the event the applicant does not include non-buildable or constrained lands as part of the lots within the proposed subdivision, such residual land shall be retained by the applicant or transferred to a homeowner’s association, a municipality, or a conservancy. Furthermore, the developer shall provide evidence that any recipient entity has the fiscal and administrative capacity to own, pay taxes upon (if appropriate) and maintain such land. 

4. 	
Lot Access: Every lot in a subdivision shall abut an existing road, a road created in the plan containing the lot, an access strip abutting an existing road, an access provided over another parcel through an easement agreement, or an approved private road or street, as provided for in Section 404. 

5. 	
The depth of a lot shall not exceed four times the width (4:1).  However, when the width of a lot exceeds four hundred fifty (450) feet, the regulation on depth and width ratio shall be waived. The lot width shall be measured at the building setback line. 

6. 	
Lots shall meet the minimum front yard setback requirements for all sides upon which there is street frontage, as well as along any private right-of-ways or access easements. 

7. 	
Front setbacks for all lots that abut an existing or proposed arterial street or road, as determined by the Functional Class Map for Mercer County, shall be increased by twenty percent (20%). 

8. 	
Double frontage lots or reverse frontage lots shall be discouraged except where lots abut, along their rear line, arterial or collector roads, in which case the rear building line of the lots shall be seventy-five (75) feet from the street right-of-way line.  Such lots shall have no right of access to the abutting arterial or collector street. 

9. 	
Sidelines of lots shall generally be at right angles or radial to streets lines.

1. 	
The coordinated planting of deciduous street trees are required on both sides of the street in all Type III Subdivisions and all roads with sidewalks. 

2. 	
Street trees shall be planted within the strip between the cartway edge and sidewalk. If that is not feasible, street trees may be placed between the sidewalk and the building; however, the street trees must be placed within 10 feet of the sidewalk. This option can only be done with the approval of the local municipality and the Planning Commission. 

3. 	
Such trees shall be 2” to 2.5” in diameter, measured at chest height, when planted, and shall be spaced at intervals no greater than forty (40) feet along both sides of each street, including arterial roads, but not including rear access lanes or alleys.

ARTICLE V LAND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
Section 501: Jurisdiction 
In defining the term “Land Development,” the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC) recognizes both subdivisions and other forms of land development. Article IV of this Ordinance sets forth the design standards for subdivisions.  This Article sets forth the standards for all other land developments. Subdivisions shall not have to additionally comply with the provisions of Article V. 
It shall be unlawful for an applicant to construct land developments, as defined herein, without complying with standards set forth in this Article. Additional criteria for certain land developments are covered in subsequent Sections in this Article. 
501.1: Land Development 
Definition: The improvement of one (1) lot or two (2) or more contiguous lots, tracts, or parcels of land for any purpose involving a group of two (2) or more residential or nonresidential buildings, whether proposed initially or cumulatively, or a single nonresidential building on a lot or lots regardless of the number of occupants or tenure. 
The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code excludes the following developments from being enforced as a land development, and thus are not subject to this Article: 
1. 	
The conversion of an existing single-family detached dwelling or single-family semi­detached dwelling into not more than three (3) residential units, unless such units are intended to be a condominium; 

2. 	
The addition of an accessory building, including farm buildings, on a lot or lots subordinate to an existing principal building; 

3. 	
The addition or conversion of buildings or rides within the confines of an enterprise that would be considered an amusement park. For purposes of this subclause, an amusement park is defined as a tract or area used principally as a location for permanent amusement structures or rides. This exclusion shall not apply to newly acquired acreage by an amusement park until initial plans for the expanded area have been approved by proper authorities. 


Section 502: Provisions for Minor Land Developments 
A land development shall be considered a minor land development if it meets all of the following criteria: 
1. 	
It does not involve a non-agricultural earth disturbance of more than five (5) acres. 

2. 	
It does not involve a building or combination or group of buildings of greater than forty thousand (40,000) square feet gross floor area. 




Section 503: Procedures for Minor Land Development 
If the land development meets the criteria for a minor land development, the following steps shall be followed prior to plan approval: 
1. 	
The applicant shall submit to the County a copy of all information pertaining to application for a local building permit and other required local municipality permits, as applicable. 

2. 	
The applicant shall submit evidence of approval of applicable permits by the issuing municipality. 


Section 504: Provisions for Major Land Developments 
A land development shall be considered a major land development if it does not meet the criteria for a minor land development specified in Section 502. 
Section 505: Procedures for Major Land Development 
The submission process for major land developments in those Mercer County municipalities with locally adopted zoning ordinances shall follow the procedures for a minor land development as described in Section 503.  However, written, clear evidence must be presented that the proposed major land development has secured all needed local municipal zoning approvals. 
In processing a major land development, the three-stage procedure established in this Ordinance for subdivisions shall be used:  Sketch Plan (not mandatory), Preliminary Site Plan, and Final Site Plan stages. 
Unless otherwise noted, the processing requirements, drawing size, certifications, acknowledgments, number of copies, etc. for submission of land development site plans shall be the same as for a major subdivision, and the final site plan shall be recorded in the Mercer County Recorder's Office. 
Section 506: Final Plan Review 
In addition to other final plan requirements for a major subdivision, the following items shall be included for Final Plan review for all land developments, as applicable: 
1. 	
Site plans, as required in this Article, engineering plans detailing the construction of all required improvements, and other data information establishing compliance with the design standards of this Article. 

2. 	
Proof of approvals by all appropriate public and governmental authorities or agencies, where applicable, including, but not limited to, permits for any planned road entrances onto existing roads or highways (PennDOT or municipality) and permits or approvals from the Department of Environmental Protection or other State agencies relating to sewage facilities, water obstructions, air quality, etc., as applicable. 

3. 	
In case of multi-owner or multi-tenant developments, proof of the organization and means for management and maintenance of common open space, parking and other 


common utilities or improvements. Instruments demonstrating creation of an association or entity or other means of assuring continuing maintenance shall be required. 
Section 507: Site Plan 
In lieu of a plot plan, the developer shall submit a site plan. Such plan shall be at a scale determined as follows: 
1. 	
If the size of the proposed land development is five (5) acres or smaller, (including buildings, parking and nonagricultural earth disturbance areas) the site plan shall be drawn to a scale of one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet (1”=100’). 

2. 	
If the size of the proposed land development is between five (5) acres and fifty (50) acres (including buildings, parking and nonagricultural earth disturbance areas) the site plan shall be drawn to a scale of one (1) inch equals two hundred (200) feet (1”=200’). 

3. 	
If the size of the proposed land development is over fifty (50) acres (including buildings, parking and nonagricultural earth disturbance areas) the site plan shall be drawn to a scale of one (1) inch equals four hundred (400) feet (1”=400’). 


Where it is planned that building, parking lot, and earth disturbance of the land development will cover an area in excess of five (5) acres, topographic data at two (2) foot contour intervals shall be included on the site plan. 
In addition to the other requirements for preliminary and final subdivision and land development plans set forth, as applicable, each land development site plan shall show: 
1. 	
Existing site conditions (topography, drainage, tree clusters, buildings, utilities, streets and neighboring properties). 

2. 	
Proposed developments, including buildings (with frontal elevation), parking, vehicular and pedestrian access areas, storm drainage, landscaping, utility location and size. 


Section 508: Design Standards for Major Land Developments 
Major land developments shall meet the following design requirements. It is recognized by the Planning Commission that the design process should be somewhat flexible, pursuant to Section 503(5) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. 
Generally, the criteria and design for facilities for transportation and parking shall be based upon accepted professional publications and/or resources, such as The Dimensions of Parking (Washington, D.C.: Urban Land Institute and National Parking Association) or Transportation and Land Development or Traffic Impact Studies For Site Development: A Recommended Practice (both Washington, D.C.: Institute of Transportation Engineers) or the reasonable application of design standards for major subdivisions. 
508.1: General Design 
1. 	
The developer shall make satisfactory provision for the improvements necessary to the proper functioning of the development, including but not limited to, street access signs, water supply facilities, sewage disposal facilities and stormwater management. 

2. 	
The development plan shall provide for adequate privacy, light, air and protection from noise through building design, street layout, screening, plantings and placement of buildings. 

3. 	
All land developments required to submit plans for approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry shall show evidence of such approval. 

4. 	
Where applicable, proof of a Highway Occupancy Permit (Penn DOT) or similar driveway/road access permit shall be required. 



508.2: Transportation 
1. 	
Vehicular access connections to the surrounding existing street network shall be safe, shall have adequate sight distances, and shall have the capacity to handle the projected traffic. The standards set forth by Section 406, Alleys, Driveways and Easements, shall be considered for road access. 

2. 	
Streets may be planned for dedication to the public or may be planned as private streets to be maintained by the developer or other association or entity.  Private streets shall meet any applicable municipal standards regarding sub-grade preparation, base and surfacing construction, or in the absence of such regulations, shall follow minimum design standards for streets, as described in Section 404, Streets, of this Ordinance. Off-street parking areas may be integrated with public street design and construction provided maintenance responsibilities are mutually agreed upon. 

3. 	
For multi-building land developments, a complete interior pedestrian circulation plan shall be submitted by all developers indicating the safe and efficient movement of people within and through the site. All traffic, parking and pedestrian plans shall be completed using such standard resource criteria as provided by the American Planning Association or the Institute for Traffic Engineers. 



508.3: Waste Storage and Disposal 
1. 	Waste storage and disposal areas for the land development shall be planned and constructed in a way that they are not visible from the public right-of-way or neighboring properties. 

508.4: Parking 
1. 	
A parking and access plan shall be submitted along with estimated traffic flows. The developer shall demonstrate that the proposed parking/access layout is adequate for the proposed development, based upon standard parking capacity measurements, including number of spaces per anticipated development type. 

2. 
Number of Parking Spaces Required: The number of off-street parking spaces provided is determined by the following table: 

3. 	
Parking Space Size and Access: Off-street parking spaces shall have an area determined by their use. In the case of multi-family dwellings, mobile home parks, industrial and manufacturing establishments, warehouses, wholesale and truck terminals, each space shall be not less than one hundred forty-four (144) square feet, being at least eight (8) feet wide and eighteen (18) feet long. For all other uses, each space shall have a uniform area of one hundred eighty (162) square feet, being at least nine (9) feet wide and eighteen 

(18) feet long.  These uniform sizes shall be exclusive of access drives or aisles, and shall be in usable shape and condition.  Parking areas shall be designed to provide sufficient turnaround area so that vehicles are not required to back onto public streets. Where an existing lot does not abut on a public or private street, alley, or easement of access, there shall be provided an access drive leading to the parking or storage areas or loading spaces. Such access drive shall be consistent with requirements for private streets or access drive rights-of-way in this Ordinance.  Access to off-street parking areas shall be limited to well-defined locations, and in no case shall there be unrestricted access along a street. The width of aisles shall be appropriate based upon the configuration of parking spaces, as recommended by nationally accepted standards contained in professional publications, as noted previously in this section. 

4. 	
Drainage and Stormwater Control: All parking and loading areas and access drives shall have either: 

a. 	
A mud and dust-free surface, graded with positive drainage, and using pervious material to prevent the flow of surface water onto neighboring properties. This option is only allowed for parking lots of less than forty (40) spaces. 

b. 	
A paved surface, graded with positive drainage to prevent the flow of surface water onto neighboring properties.  Paved off-street parking lots in excess of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet shall have minimum planting strips between the parking lot and all lot lines to be planted with one (1) hardwood or coniferous tree per each two (2) parking spaces or combination thereof.  Trees that die shall be replaced. Plantings shall conform to Section 510.3. Eight percent (8%) of the total interior space shall be devoted to interior planting strips containing trees, shrubbery, and/or annual plants designed in pervious dust- and mud-free material. Drainage plans shall take full advantage of pervious material areas. 



5. 	
Location and Parking: Required parking spaces shall be located on the same lot with the principal use. In areas listed on the Mercer County Comprehensive Plan as either Revitalization Target Areas or Urban/Suburban Preservation of Uses and Features, where there is either on street or public off street parking or available private lots, the County may permit parking spaces to be located not more than two hundred (200) feet from the lot of the principal use, if adequate capacity can be shown. 

6. 	
Screening, Landscaping and Setbacks: Off-street parking areas for more than five (5) vehicles and off-street loading areas shall be effectively screened on any side that adjoins a dwelling, residential district, or platted residential lots.  In addition, there shall be a planting strip of at least five (5) feet between the front lot line and the parking lot. Such planting strips shall be suitably landscaped and maintained.  No off-street loading or parking area for more than five (5) vehicles shall be closer than ten (10) feet to any adjoining property line containing a dwelling, residential district, or platted residential lots.

508.9: Utilities 
1. 	Gas, electric, telephone and cable utilities shall be located in land developments in accordance with utility company standards and requirements. All such utilities shall be underground. 
Section 509: Assurance for Completion and Maintenance of Improvements 
Insofar as the land development involves the lease or rental of buildings and/or space on the site and site improvements (such as streets, parking areas and stormwater drainage devices), that are to be privately maintained or maintained by a private (non-public) organization or entity created by the developer – there may be a need for municipal acceptance of the site improvements. However, in these instances, streets and stormwater drainage shall be designed and built to the standards established in this Ordinance. Where the developer does not intend to maintain the improvement and where a homeowner’s association or similar organization will not be organized for these responsibilities, the developer will submit a plan for maintenance of such facilities. This document will be legally enforceable, clearly establishing maintenance responsibility. It must be approved by the County and the applicable municipality or accepting authority.  Any proposed improvement to be offered for public declaration will follow the requirements as specified by these regulations. Among other remedies to enforce this section, the County may refuse to issue building permits. 
Section 510: Additional Criteria for Commercial and Industrial Major Land Developments 
The following standards shall apply to all commercial and industrial major land developments: 

510.1: Transportation 
1. 	
Traffic movements in and out of commercial and industrial areas should not interfere with external traffic, nor should it create hazards for adjacent residential areas. 

2. 	
The design of streets, service drives and pedestrian ways should provide for safe and hazard-free internal circulation. 

3. 	
Parking areas in excess of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet shall maintain easements to connect to existing or potential future parking lots on the same or adjacent parcels. 



510.2: Setbacks and Yard Sizes 
Building setback lines shall be as specified by the local zoning ordinance. Where no local ordinance is in effect, the following standards shall apply for setbacks and yard sizes: 
1. 	
Front Yard: Front yard setback lines shall be not less than forty (40) feet. However, in areas listed on the Mercer County Comprehensive Plan as either Revitalization Target Areas or Urban/Suburban Preservation of Uses and Features and in areas with on-street 

parking, front setback lines may be reduced to zero (0) or the average of any abutting buildings to either side and all parking is confined to the side or rear of the lot. 

2. 	
Side Yard: Side yard setback lines shall be not less than forty (40) feet. Setback lines shall increase three (3) feet for every one thousand (1,000) square feet gross floor area above forty thousand (40,000) square feet. However, in areas listed on the Mercer County Comprehensive Plan as either Revitalization Target Areas or Urban/Suburban Preservation of Uses and Features and with on-street parking, front setback lines may be reduced to ten (10) Feet or the average of any abutting buildings. 

3. 	
Rear Yard: Rear yard setback lines shall be not less than forty (40) feet. However, in areas listed on the Mercer County Comprehensive Plan as either Revitalization Target Areas or Urban/Suburban Preservation of Uses and Features in areas with on street parking, front setback lines may be reduced to ten (10) Feet or the average of any abutting buildings. 



510.3: Landscaping and Screening 
Commercial and industrial land developments that abut pre-existing residential development or platted residential lots shall employ the following screening: 
1. 	Type I Screening: Major land developments of less than ten (10) acres, or 40,000­100,000 square feet of gross floor area shall include screening consisting of a triple row of Norway Spruce or similar coniferous species that can withstand dense planting, planted at oblique lines to one another so that a continuous screen is provided. 
a.  The planting standards shall be twenty-eight (28) conifer and eight (8) deciduous  
trees per each one hundred (100) lineal feet of yard area.   All trees shall be a  
minimum of six (6) feet in height at the time of planting. Trees that die shall be  
replaced within six (6) months.  
b.  A preferred screening technique is for the developer to preserve a minimum  
fifty (50) foot buffer of existing natural vegetation.   If the preservation of  
existing natural vegetation is determined to be sufficient for screening the  
site from neighboring residential properties and sufficient for storm water  
management and erosion control, it can act as an alternative to the triple row  
of Norway Spruce or similar coniferous species that can withstand dense  


planting. This buffer area shall not be used for parking or other uses. 
2. 	Type II Screening: All major land developments of a hazardous nature including communications towers, fuel storage, or similar industrial activities (no matter where their location) shall include screening consisting of: 
a. 	
An opaque fence at least six (6) feet in height; 

b. 	
A barrier fence at least eight (8) feet in height; 

c. 	
On the outside perimeter of the fence, a ten (10) foot planting strip shall be maintained at a planting standard of ten (10) coniferous and ten (10) deciduous trees per one hundred (100) feet. Trees shall be a minimum of six (6) feet tall at planting and replaced within six (6) months of death. 


3. 	Type III Screening: Major land developments of greater than ten (10) acres, or greater than 100,000 square feet of gross floor area shall include screening consisting of a preserved existing natural vegetation buffer of at least fifty (50) feet providing sufficient opaque screening during at least six (6) months of the year. 
a. 	
If the preservation of existing natural vegetation is determined to be insufficient for screening the site from neighboring properties and sufficient for storm water management and erosion control, the developer shall create a buffer. The planting standards shall be eight (8) deciduous trees and twenty-eight (28) coniferous trees per each one hundred (100) lineal feet of buffer yard. Trees that die shall be replaced within six (6) months. This buffer yard shall be in addition to any other yard requirements listed. 

b. 	
A screening yard of Norway Spruce or similar coniferous species that can withstand dense planting. An initial row of trees shall be planted to follow a lineal centerline with additional rows planted at oblique angles on each side of the centerline row, sufficient to provide complete and constant opaque screening from neighboring properties at the time of planting. This screen of plantings shall be situated at the interior edge of the natural vegetation buffer yard and may be included in calculations of required yard areas. 


4. 	Additional Landscaping Requirements 
a. 	To further provide for the natural management of storm water runoff within the context of land development, fifty percent (50%) of all hardwood trees of a minimum caliper of four (4) inches that do not lie in buildable lot footprint areas shall be preserved. 
Section 511: Additional Criteria for Multi-Family Dwellings 
511.1: Jurisdiction Exception

511.2: Exception for Minor Alternative 
For the purpose of this Article, a multi-family dwelling development involving not more than nine (9) dwelling units shall be considered a minor land development. Ten (10) or more dwelling units shall be considered a major land development. 

511.3: Recreation Area 
1. 	Multi-family dwellings shall reserve no less than ten percent (10%) of total lot area as passive or active recreation space for the benefit of residents. This land shall be suitable for the purpose for which it is proposed. 

511.4: Density 
All multiple-family dwelling land developments shall comply with the following standards: 
With Public Sewer  With Approved On-Lot  Sewer Systems  
Minimum Lot Area  12,000 square feet for first unit, plus 4,000 square feet for each additional unit thereafter.  1 Acre for the first 3 units, plus 10,000 square feet for each additional unit thereafter.  
Minimum Lot Width  100 feet  100 feet  
Minimum Front Yard  40 feet  40 feet  
Minimum Side Yard  40 feet  40 feet for the first 3 units plus 1 foot for each additional unit thereafter.

Section 905:  Preventive Remedies 
The Planning Commission may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further improve or develop any real property that has been developed or that has resulted from a subdivision of real property in violation of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this Ordinance. This authority to deny such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants: 
1. 	
The owner of record at the time of such violation. 

2. 	
The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.

ARTICLE X IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEES 
Section 1001: Improvement Guarantees 
1. 	
Purpose: Improvement guarantees may be provided by the developer or subdivider to ensure the proper installation and maintenance of required street, utility and other public improvements. The nature and duration of the guarantee shall be structured to achieve this goal without adding unnecessary costs to the developer. These guarantees are to comply with Section 509 of the MPC. 

2. 	
Completion of Improvements: 

a. 	
Before the recording of final subdivision plans, the Planning Commission may require and shall accept in accordance with the standards adopted by ordinance the following guarantees: 

i. 	The furnishing of a performance guarantee in an amount not to exceed one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the cost of installation for improvements; 
ii. 	Provision for a maintenance guarantee in the form of financial security for a period not to exceed eighteen (18) months after final acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the cost of the improvement. In the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities to be installed, or the improvements are covered by a performance or maintenance guarantee to another governmental agency, and such guarantees are satisfactory to such agencies, no performance or maintenance guarantee, as the case may be, shall be required by the Planning Commission for such utilities or improvements. 

b. 	
The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been provided may be extended one (1) time for not more than one 


(1) year by the Planning Commission and/or local municipality by resolution. 

3. 	
Release from Improvement Surety: 


a. 	When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the local municipality, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Planning Commission.  The municipality shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Municipal Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Municipal Engineer shall thereupon file a report, in writing, with the Planning Commission, the local municipality and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within thirty 
(30) days after receipt by the Municipal Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Planning Commission. Said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Municipal Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reasons for such non-approval or rejection. 
b. 	
The Planning Commission, working as an agent of the County, and the local municipality shall notify the developer, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the action of said municipality with relation thereto. 

c. 	
If the Planning Commission or the Municipal Engineer fails to comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be released from a liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other security agreement. 

d. 	
If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the Planning Commission and the local municipality, the developer shall proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed. Upon acceptance of the public improvements, one set of as-built construction drawings shall be delivered to the Planning Commission and one set to the Municipal Secretary. 

e. 	
Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise, any determination of the municipality, county, or the Municipal Engineer. 

f. 	
Where herein reference is made to the Municipal Engineer, he/she shall be a duly Pennsylvania registered professional engineer employed by the Planning Commission or engaged as a consultant thereto. 

g. 	
The applicant shall reimburse the municipality for the reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection of improvements. Such reimbursement shall be based upon a schedule established by ordinance or resolution.  Such expense shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the engineer or consultant for work performed for similar services in the community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the engineer or consultant to the Planning Commission when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants. 


i. 	In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall, within ten (10) working days of the date of billing, notify the Planning Commission that such expenses are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the municipality shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development application or any approval or permit related to development due to the applicant's request over disputed engineer expenses. 
ii. 	If, within twenty (20) days from the date of billing, the Planning Commission and the applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses that are reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and municipality shall jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another Pennsylvania registered professional engineer to review the said expenses and make a determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary. 
iii. The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his or her sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within fifty (50) days of the billing date. The applicant shall be required to pay the entire amount determined in the decision immediately. 
iv. 
In the event that the Planning Commission and applicant cannot agree upon the professional engineer to be appointed within twenty (20) days of the billing date, then, upon application of either party, the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the municipality is located (or if at the time there be no President Judge, then the senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither the Planning Commission Engineer nor any professional engineer who has been retained by, or performed services for, the municipality or the applicant within the preceding five years. 

v. 	
The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in the decision is less than the original bill by one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, the Planning Commission shall pay the fee of the professional engineer, but otherwise the Planning Commission and the applicant shall each pay one-half (1/2) of the fee of the appointed professional engineer. 


4. 	
Remedies to Effect Completion of Improvements: In the event that any improvements that may be required have not been installed as provided in this Ordinance or in accord with the approved final plat, the Planning Commission is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If proceeds of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said security, the municipality may, at its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used 

solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not for any other municipal purpose. 

5. 	
Performance and Maintenance Mechanisms: Performance and maintenance guarantees shall be provided in a number of forms including, but not limited to, the following: 

a. 	
Security Bond, Performance Bond and Labor and Materials Bond: The applicant may obtain a bond from a security bonding company authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

NOW, THEREFORE, the City of Farrell ordains as follows:
ARTICLE I· GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 101 - Short Title
This Ordinance shall be known as and may be cited as "The City of Farrell Stormwater Management
Ordinance."
SECTION 102 - Statement of Findings
Council of the City of Farrell ("Municipality") finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development
throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control storrnwater, undermines flood plain management and flood control
efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health and
safety, and increases non-point source pollution of water resomces.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety,
and welfare and the protection of people of the Commonwealth, and this Municipality, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides groundwater recharge for water
supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stonnwater
controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for storrnwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES).
E. Public education is necessary for the proper understanding and implementation of stormwater
management in the community in which it functions.
SECTION 103 - Purpose
The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the Municipality and its
watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in Section 102 (Statement of
Findings) of this Ordinance, through provisions designed to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of this
Commonwealth.
- I -
B. Manage the volume, rate and quality of stormwater runoff.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
D. Manage stormwater runoff as close to the source as possible.
E. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management.
F. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
G. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds from accelerated runoff.
H. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent SWM BMP's that are implemented
and constructed within the Municipality.
I. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
J. Integrate stormwater management into the land development site planning process.

Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) - Infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are affected by subsurface
permeability as well as surface intake rates. Soils are classified into four HSG's (A, B, C, and D) according
to their minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the US Department of Agriculture defines the four groups and
provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their group classification. The soils in the area of
the development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be obtained from local NRCS
offices or conservation district offices. Soils become less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS
3,4).

SECTION 303 - Volume Controls
The Low Impact Development practices, like those provided in the BMP Manual shall be utilized for all
regulated activities to the maximum extent practicable. Water volume controls shall be implemented using
the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B. For regulated activity
areas equal or Jess than 1 acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design the stonnwater facil ities, this
Ordinance establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either
methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicabi lity of the
analytical procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable to any size of regulated
activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
- 1 I -
1. Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less
than the 2-year 24-hour duration precipitation.
2. For hydrologic modeling purposes:
a. Existing pre-development non-forested pervfous areas must be considered meadow
or its equivalent in good condition.
b. Existing (pre-development) impervious areas, when present, must consider twenty
(20) percent of the impervious area as meadow in good condition.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of site conditions and should
be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one (1) acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage
facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
1. Storm water facilities shall capture at least the first two inches (2") of runoff from all new
impervious surfaces.
2. At least the first one inch (1 ") of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be release into the surface
waters of this Commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration,
and infiltration.
3. Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of
the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first one-half inch
(0.5'') of the permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
4. This method is exempt from the requirements of Section 304 (Rate Controls).
SECTION 304 - Rate Controls
Post-development peak discharge rates shall not exceed the pre-development peak discharge rates for the, 2-
year, I 0-year, 25-year, and I 00-year storm events.
SECTION 305 - Calculation Methodology
Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calcuJated using either the Rational Method
(stormwater conveyance systems only) or a soil cover complex methodology as follows:
A. Major and minor conveyance systems up to 20 acres may be designed using the Rational Method.
The Rational Method may also be used in sizing the minor conveyance systems for larger sites.
Any stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater than 20 acres, including onsite
and off-site areas, shall use a generally accepted runoff hydrograph technique that is based on
the NRCS Soil Cover Complex method. Runoff hydrograph methods must be used for major
drainage system designs for all systems with greater than 20 acres of drainage area and for design
of all storm water storage facilities.
B. All calculations consistent with this Ordinance using the Soil Cover Complex method shall use
the appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return period storms presented Section 301
- 12 -
(General Requirements), Item L. If a hydrologic computer model is used for stormwater runoff
calculations, the duration of rainfall shall be 24 hours. The SCS Rainfall Type II curve shall be
used for the rainfall distribution.
C. For the purposes of existing pre-development runoff rate determination, undeveloped nonforested
pervious areas including disturbed areas must be considered meadow in good condition,
or its equivalent in good condition. Those areas that have existing impervious areas within the
planned development area may be included in the determination of the predevelopment flow rate.
D. All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities from the PrecipitationFreguency
Atlas of the United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0, U.S. Department of
Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather
Service, Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Silver Spring, Maryland. NOAA's Atlas
14 can be accessed at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
E. Times-of-concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology presented in
Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55. Travel time for channel and
pipe flow shall be computed using velocities determined using Manning's equation.
F. Runoff Curve Numbers (CN) for both existing (pre-development) and proposed (postdevelopment)
conditions to be used in the Soil Cover Complex method shall be obtained from
Chapter 2 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55.
G. Runoff coefficients (CJ for both existing (pre-development) and proposed (post-development)
conditions for use in the Rational method shall be:

APPENDIX A
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE SMALL PROJECT APPLICATION
The Small Projects Application was designed to assist individuals constructing improvements of impervious
surfaces (surfaces that do not infiltrate water, i.e. rooftops driveways, sidewalks, etc.) a method for
determining if control measures are required to be implemented to comply with the SWM Ordinance.
Step 1:
Step 2:
Step 3:
Step 4:
Step 5:
Step 6:
Step 7:
Determine the length (in feet) and width (in feet) of the proposed improvement and insert into
the "Length" and "Width" columns under the respective "Surface Type." If the "Surface
Type" is not listed use "Other" and list the improvement type. Irregular surfaces will require
additional mathematical equations not listed in the application or the examples.
Multiply the length times the width and insert that number into the "Impervious Area (ft2
)"
column. This number will be in square feet.
Add the numbers in the "Impervious Area (ft2
)" column and insert the total number of square
feet in the "TOT AL IMPERVIOUS AREA" box.
If the "TOTAL IMPERVIOUS AREA" is:
2,500 square feet or less your project is exempt and you can proceed with construction as
planned (see Example #1),
2,500 square feet to 5,000 square feet you are required to submit the application to the
municipality, along with details on how you will manage the increase in runoff (implement
volume controls) (see Example #2)
5,000 square feet or more your project requires a SWM Plan prepared by a Pennsylvania
Registered Design Professional experienced in the design of such control measures and to the
requirements of the Stormwater Management Ordinance.
If credit will be taken for DIA (Disconnected Impervious Area), list the "Qualifying Surfaces"
obtain the square footage of the impervious area by muJtiplying the length times the width
(see Example #2).
Subtract the "DIA CREDITS" from the "TOTAL IMPERVIOUS AREA" and insert this
number in the "TOTAL AREA TO BE MANAGED BY BMP'S" box.
Multiply the number in the "TOTAL AREA TO BE MANAGED BY BMP' S" box by 0.20
(20 %) and insert that number into the "SURF ACE AREA OF BMP'S ( ft2
) " box. This
number will be in square feel.
