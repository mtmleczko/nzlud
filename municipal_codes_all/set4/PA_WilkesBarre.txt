PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. 
    This volume is a republication of the Code as supplemented through Ord. No. 25-2006, adopted January 11, 2007. 
    Part I of this volume contains the Home Rule Charter of the City. 
    Part II, the Code, is a recodification of the ordinances of the City of Wilkes-Barre of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixth section of Chapter 5 is 5-6. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 5-4 and 5-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-4.1, 5-4.2, 5-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a decimal. after the chapter number, e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CHARTER APPENDIX A CHTAA:1 CHARTER APPENDIX B CHTAB:1 CHARTER APPENDIX COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This republished Code was prepared under the supervision of A. Lawton Langford, Corporate President, and Pattie F. Smith, Supplement Editor, with the able assistance of the MCC staff. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. James Ryan, City Clerk for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Wilkes-Barre readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Bill Carroll of the editorial staff of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

    Pursuant to the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Acts of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City shall have and may exercise all powers of legislation and administration in relation to its municipal functions. The City shall have and may exercise any power and may perform any function not denied by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Acts of the General Assembly, in effect as of the effective date of this Charter, or of this Charter. 
Section 2:02. - Construction. 
    The powers of the City under this Charter shall be construed liberally in favor of the City, and the specific mention of particular powers in this Charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers stated in this Article. All possible powers of the City are to be considered as fully and completely as though they are specifically enumerated in this Charter. 
ARTICLE III. - COUNCIL-THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH 

Section 3:01. - Composition. 
    There shall be a City Council of five (5) members nominated and elected by the qualified voters of the City by district. 
(Ord. No. 50-04, § 1, 10-7-04) 
Section 3:02. - Eligibility. 
    Only qualified voters domiciled in their respective districts of the City shall be eligible to hold the office of Council Member. 
(Ord. No. 50-04, § 1, 10-7-04) 
Section 3:03. - Election and terms. 
    The regular election of Council Members shall be held on the general municipal Election Day as established by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. All five (5) Council members shall be elected at the first election under this Charter for a term of four (4) years. 
(Ord. No. 50-04, § 1, 10-7-04) 
Editor's note- The City Charter was changed by referendum in November, 2001. Due to various legal challenges, the City Council did not run in districts, nor reduce to five (5) members until the municipal election 2007. The case of Bergold v. Vonderheid, et.al., Luzerne County Docket Number 11064 of 2006, judicially determined that the referendum was considered formally implemented in 2003. In 1975 the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, in reviewing the intent of the newly-enacted Charter determined that elections for Mayor, City Controller and City Council must be "co-terminous" or held during the same year. 
State Law reference- Municipal election shall be held biennially on the Tuesday next following the first Monday of November in each odd-numbered year, 25 P.S. § 2752. 
Section 3:04. - Compensation. 
    Each Council member elected at the first election under this Charter shall receive an annual salary in the amount of $5,000. The Chairman shall receive an additional $1,000 annually. Thereafter, the Council may determine the annual salary of Council members by ordinance, but no ordinance changing such salary shall become effective until the date of commencement of the terms of Council Members elected at the next regular election, provided that such election follows the adoption of such ordinance by at least six (6) months. 
(Ord. No. 7-90, § 1, 3-8-90) 
Code reference- Compensation of elected officials, § 2-142. 
Note- (NOTE: City Council has changed the salaries of the members several times since the enactment of this Charter in 1975 and 1976. However, since the Charter grants the Council the right to change the salaries by ordinance, a change in the Charter is not required and any ordinance passed need not be inserted as part of this Charter.) 
Section 3:05. - Vacancies. 
    The office of Council members shall become vacant upon death of the Member, resignation, removal from office in any manner authorized by law or forfeiture of the office. 
Section 3:06. - Forfeiture of office.

(2)  Violates any express prohibition of this Charter. 
(3)  Is convicted of a crime which results in a sentence of imprisonment being imposed, the maximum of which is in excess of one year whether or not suspended. 
(4)  Fails to attend four (4) consecutive regular meetings of the Council without being excused by Council. 
    In all cases of forfeiture, the Member shall be entitled to notice and a hearing in accordance with administrative procedures to be established by Council. 
Section 3:07. - Filling of vacancies.

(a)  During the lifetime of any person in the employment of the city, and after the enactment of Ordinance No. 14-96, such person shall be entitled to receive as a pension annually from the fund set aside for that purpose fifty (50) percentum of the amount which he or she received during the member's highest two-year average salary, such person to be paid in monthly payments, retroactive to January 1, 1995. Any person who shall have been so employed shall receive a service increment of one and one-quarter (11/4) percent for each and every year of service over twenty (20) years with a maximum cumulative service increment of not more than ten (10) percent and a maximum annual pension of not more than sixty (60) percent of the amount which would constitute the average annual salary or wages which he or she received during the last or any five (5) years of his or her employment by such city, whichever is higher, such pension to be paid in monthly payments. Should any person so employed after twenty (20) years of service voluntarily retire or be in any manner deprived of his or her position or employment before attaining the age of fifty-five (55) years, such person shall be entitled to the pension above-mentioned; but such pension shall not commence until he or she has attained the age of fifty-five (55) years. In addition, should any person so employed after ten (10) years of service voluntarily leave, be dismissed or in any manner deprived of his or her position or employment before the age of sixty-two (62) years, such person shall be entitled to the partial pension above-mentioned in section 2-155 at the rate of two and one-half (21/2) percent for each year of service, but such pension shall not commence until he or she has attained the age of sixty-two (62) years. However, any person contributing at the rate of three and one-half (31/2) percent and not having paid the difference between three and one-half (31/2) and five (5) percent two (2) years prior to retirement or termination would have their pension proportionately reduced by the forty (40) percent of social security at age sixty-two (62). Should any employee, however, become totally and permanently disabled, after ten (10) years of service and before attaining the age of sixty-two (62) years, he shall be entitled to the pension. Proof of total and permanent disability shall consist of the sworn statement of three (3) practicing physicians, designated by the board, that the employee is in a permanent condition of health which would permanently disable him from performing the duties of his position or office. 
(b)  The pension to be paid joint coverage members according to the provisions of the federal Social Security Act and applicable state laws, payable after the age and upon that portion of annual compensation on which Social Security benefits are payable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to forty (40) percentum of the primary insurance amount of social security paid or payable to the member. Such reduction shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Upon attainment of the age at which social security benefits are payable to a beneficiary receiving a pension or upon retirement of a contributor after attaining that age, his eligibility to the old-age insurance benefit and the primary insurance amount of social security upon which the reduction in the pension shall be based, shall be computed by the board in the manner specified in the federal Social Security Act, except that in determining such eligibility and such amount only wages or compensation for services performed in the employ of the city shall be included. 
(2)  The reduction shall not apply to a pension for total and permanent disability payable under this section. 
(3)  Whenever the amount of the reduction from the pension shall have been once determined, it shall remain fixed for the duration of the pension, except that any decrease in the primary insurance amount under the social security act shall result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of the reduction from the pension. 
(4)  The total sum, including social security benefits, to be received upon retirement by an employee who is a member of the fund at the time of the agreement shall not be less than the allowance that would be paid by the retirement system in the absence of the agreement. 
(5)  The reduction shall not apply to a pension for any employee who has completed twenty-eight (28) years of continuous service with the City of Wilkes-Barre meeting all other requirements for retirement; provided, that any employee affected by this provision immediately begins to have an amount equal to five (5) percent of his or her monthly salary or wages paid into the pension fund within the first pay period after the effective date of this subsection (5) [June 7, 1998].

(Ord. No. 43-76, § XIII, 12-27-76) 
Sec. 2-159. - Election by joint coverage members. 
(a)  Since the city has entered into an agreement with the state to place certain employees under the federal Social Security Act, the pension board may authorize any joint coverage member of the retirement system to elect according to the provisions of this section to receive compensation without the reduction provided for in section 2-156, provided he shall make a lump-sum payment to the pension board, or installment payments as may be approved by the board, equal to the difference between the amount of the accumulated fund to his credit in the fund as of the last date for which salary or wages were paid and the amount which would have been to his credit in such fund if contributions had been made on that portion of his salary or wages on which social security allowances are payable, at the same rate as made on that portion of his salary or wages in excess thereof, from the time that such salary or wages became subject to social security coverage. Such election shall be made, in writing, in the form prescribed by the pension board, and shall be accompanied by the lump-sum payment or an agreement as to installment payments herein required. 
(b)  The pension board may authorize any member to make the election herein provided at any time, and if made prior to retirement, such member shall, in addition to any lump-sum or installment payments required, pay to the board contributions on his entire salary or wages thereafter received at the rate provided in this division for monthly salary or wages in excess of that on which social security allowances are payable. 
(c)  The rate of payment under this section, for any person presently a member of the pension system shall be five (5) percent of the person's monthly salary or wages. This figure represents the figure which is paid if and when a person's salary is in excess of social security limits for which social security payments are made. 
(Ord. No. 43-76, § VII, 12-27-76) 
Sec. 2-160. - Credit for military service.

Editor's note- Ordinance No. 8-84, enacted March 22, 1984, amended Ord. No. 43-76, adopted Dec. 27, 1976, codified herein as Art. II, Div. 2, by adding the provisions set out above, but did not specify the exact manner of their inclusion. Therefore, the editor, at his discretion, has included the provisions of Ord.

Sec. 2-163. - Optional forms of payment. 
(a)  At the time that an employee applies to be placed on a pension, the employee must elect to receive a standard pension as herein set forth or one (1) of the following optional forms of payment: 
(1)  A ten-year certain and continuous life annuity. Under this form, benefits are payable for the member's lifetime but with the added guarantee that if the member should die before receiving at least one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments, then monthly payments are continued to the member's beneficiary or estate until the balance of the one hundred twenty-guaranteed payments have been made. 
Example: A member age 65 entitled to a monthly benefit of $500.00 payable for life, only could elect to receive $480.25 ($500.00 × 0.9605) monthly under the 10-year certain and continuous life annuity form. 
(2)  Survivor annuities. Under these forms of payment, a percentage (either 50%, 75% or 100%) of the member's monthly benefit is continued, following the member's death, to the member's surviving beneficiary for the duration of the beneficiary's lifetime. Note that if the beneficiary should die before the member, benefits continue in the reduced amount to the member and cease completely upon the member's death. 
Example: A member age 65 with a beneficiary age 62 entitled to a monthly pension of $500.00 payable for life only could elect to receive one of the following: 
a.  50% survivor annuity-The member would receive $445.50 monthly ($500.00 × 0.8910). Upon the member's death, the surviving beneficiary would receive $222.75 monthly ($445.50 × 0.5) for life. 
b.  75% survivor annuity-The member would receive $422.25 monthly ($500.00 × 0.8449). Upon the member's death, the surviving beneficiary would receive $316.84 monthly ($422.45 × 0.75) for life. 
c.  100% survivor annuity-The member would receive $401.70 monthly ($500.00 × 0.0834). Upon the member's death, the surviving beneficiary would receive $401.70 monthly ($401.70 × 1.00) for life. 
(b)  The amount payable under the optional forms shall be actuarially equivalent to the amount otherwise payable under the standard pension (i.e., an annuity for the employee's lifetime only) where actuarial equivalence is based on the 1983 group annuity table (male rates with ages set back one (1) year) and interest at eight (8) percent per annum compounded annually. 
(Ord. No. 28-90, § 1, 8-9-90) 
Sec. 2-164. - Election of optional payment forms by former city employees receiving standard pensions. 
    All former city employees who are currently receiving a standard pension under this pension fund, shall be afforded the opportunity to elect to receive one of the optional forms of payment as set forth in section 2-163, by making such election in writing to the keeper of the records of the pension board within thirty (30) days after the former city employee's receipt of written notice from the keeper of the records of the pension board of the former city employee's right to elect an optional form of payment. 
(Ord. No. 20-91, § 3, 9-12-91) 
Sec. 2-165. - Survivor annuities. 
    Every person employed by the City of Wilkes-Barre prior to January 24, 2001 shall make their election with regard to optional forms of payment, even though they intend to defer retirement, at the time of their completion of ten (10) consecutive years of service with the City of Wilkes-Barre. 
    Any member of the pension fund that has completed twenty-eight (28) years of service with the City of Wilkes-Barre and has reached all other requirements for pension eligibility shall be entitled to have paid monthly benefits in the amount of one hundred (100) percent of their eligible pension based on the high three-year average of the employee's annual salary or wages, and said percentage shall be continued, following the members death, to the member's surviving spouse for the duration of the spouse's lifetime. 
(Ord. No. 14-98, § 1(E), (F), 5-28-98; Ord. No. 25-06, § 1, 1-1-07; Ord. No. 30-2007, § 1(E), 12-13-07) 
Sec. 2-166. - Payment of pension fund from workers' compensation. 
    Should any employee of the City of Wilkes-Barre who is a member of the city employees pension fund be placed on workers' compensation as a consequence of a work related injury and/or occupational disease, said employee shall pay to the City of Wilkes-Barre City Employees Pension Fund an amount equal to five (5) percent of said employee's monthly salary or wages for the entire period that said employee remains on workers' compensation, and shall commence the payment of the same within thirty (30) days following said employee's receipt of his or her first workers' compensation benefit check.

    If any employee or former employee who was employed by the City of Wilkes-Barre prior to January 24, 2001, dies before the commencement of his or her retirement benefits, and who has completed ten (10) years or more of continuous service, such employee's or former employee's beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a monthly pension benefit equal to the monthly pension benefit the employee or former employee would have received had he or she retired as of the date of death; said pension payment shall be computed on the assumption that the employee or former employee was age fifty (50) at the time of death. 
(Ord. No. 30-2007, § 1(I), 12-13-07) 
Sec. 2-167. - Dispatching services-Severance package. 
    In July of 1998, Luzerne County began to perform all dispatching services for the City of Wilkes-Barre.

(Ord. No. 13-01, § I, 12-12-01) 
Sec. 2-169. - Amendments-Nonuniformed pension fund. 
    Effective for members of the nonuniformed pension fund hired on or after January 24, 2001, the following amendments shall apply to Ordinance No. 13-01: 
    Pension funds for employees other than police or city-paid firemen. Cities may create a pension fund for the pensioning of employees of said cities who are not members of the police force or city-paid fire department thereof, surviving spouses of retired members if council so elects and the families of such as may be injured or killed in the service, in the manner, under the conditions and subject to the qualifications following. As used in this subdivision "employees" included officers and officials of the city, whether elected or appointed. 
    Pension board-Duties. In any city which creates such pension fund, there shall be created a board to be known as the pension board, consisting of the mayor, the city controller, the superintendent of finance, and two (2) employees to be chosen by the employees contributing to the pension fund and, if members of council participate in the pension fund and are members of the fund, a member of council, chosen by council. It shall be the duty of said board to register all persons employed by the said city, and to administer the collection and distribution of the fund herein provided for, and make such reasonable rules in the premises as such board may deem necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this act. 
    Retirement age. Every person, now or hereafter employed by any city which has created such pension fund and pension board as hereinbefore provided, of the age of sixty (60) years and upwards, who shall have been so employed for a period of twenty (20) years or more, shall, upon application to the board of pensions herein created, be retired from service and shall, during the remainder of his or her life, receive the pension or compensation fixed by this act, subject to such qualifications as are herein contained. 
    Retirement allowance-Proof of disability; joint and single coverage members defined. During the lifetime of any person in the employment of any city crating such pension fund and pension board as hereinbefore provided, he or she shall be entitled to receive as a pension annually, from the fund set aside for the purpose, fifty (50) percent of the amount which would constitute the average annual salary or wages which he or she received during the last or any five (5) years of his or her employment by the said city, whichever is the higher, said pension to be paid in semi-monthly payments. Should any persons so employed, after twenty (20) years of service, be dismissed, voluntarily retired, or be in any manner deprived of his or her position or employment before attaining the age of sixty (60) years, upon continuing a monthly payment to the fund equal to the last amount due and paid monthly while in active service, said person shall be entitled to the pension above-mentioned, notwithstanding he or she has not attained the age of sixty (60) years at the time of his or her separation from the service of such city, but said pension shall not commence until he or she has attained the age of sixty (60) years at the time of his or her separation from the service of such city, but said pension shall not commence until he or she has attained the age of sixty (60) years. Should any employee however, become totally and permanently disabled, after ten (10) years of service and before attained [attaining] the age of sixty (60) years, he or she shall be entitled to the said pension. Proof of total and permanent disability shall consist of the sworn statement of three (3) practicing physicians, designated by the board, that the employee is in a permanent condition of health which would permanently disable him or her from performing the duties of his or her position or office. 
    For the purpose of this article on pensions, the following words shall have the meaning herein assigned to them: 
    Joint coverage member of the retirement system shall mean a city employee who shall have become a member of the retirement system subsequent to the last date permitted by such city for statement or preference concerning Social Security coverage, or who, having become a member on or before such date, shall have filed with the retirement board a written statement that he or she elects Social Security coverage under an agreement with the federal secretary of health, education and welfare entered into by the commonwealth. 
    Single-coverage member of the retirement system shall mean a city employee who shall have become a member of the retirement system on or before the last date permitted by such city for statement of preference concerning Social Security and who either shall have filed with the retirement board a written statement that he or she does not elect Social Security coverage under any agreement with the federal secretary of health, education and welfare entered into by the commonwealth, or shall not have filed with the retirement board any written statement. 
    Where a city has entered into an agreement with the commonwealth to place certain employees under the federal Social Security Act, the pension to be paid joint coverage members according to the provisions of this section payable after the age and upon that portion of annual compensation on which Social Security benefits are payable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to forty (40) percent of the primary insurance amount of Social Security paid or payable to the member. Such reduction shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Upon attainment of the age at which Social Security benefits are payable by a beneficiary receiving a pension or upon retirement of a contributor after attaining that age, his eligibility to the old age insurance benefit and the primary insurance amount of social security upon which the reduction in the pension shall be based, shall be computed by the board in the manner specified in the federal Social Security Act, except that in determining such eligibility and such amount only wages or compensation for services performed in the employ of the city shall be included. 
(2)  The reduction shall not apply to a pension for total permanent disability payable under this section. 
(3)  Whenever the amount of the reduction from the pension shall have been once determined, it shall remain fixed for the duration of the pension, except that any decrease in the primary insurance amount under the Social Security Act shall result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of the reduction from the pension. 
(4)  The total sum, including Social Security benefits, to be received upon retirement by an employee who is a member of the system at the time of the agreement shall not be less than the allowance that would be paid by the retirement system in the absence of the agreement. 
If council elects, by ordinance, to make such payments, the surviving spouse of an employee who retired on pension or is killed in the service on or after January 1, 1960, shall, during his lifetime or so long as he does not remarry, be entitled to receive a pension calculated at the rate of fifty (50) percent of the pension member was receiving or would have been entitled to had he been retired at the time of his death. 
    Retirement allowances; full coverage; payments. Where a city has entered into an agreement with the commonwealth to place certain employees under the federal Social Security Act, the pension board may authorize any joint coverage member of the retirement system to elect according to the provisions of this section to receive compensation without the reduction provided for in section 4343, provided he shall make a lump-sum payment to the pension board, or installment payments as may be approved by the board, equal to the difference between the amount of the accumulated fund to his credit in the fund as of the last date for which salary or wages was paid and the amount which would have been to his credit in such fund if contributions had been made on that portion of his salary or wages on which Social Security allowances are payable, at the same rate as made on that portion of his salary or wages in excess thereof, from the time that such salary or wages became subject to Social Security coverage. Such election shall be made, in writing, in the form prescribed by the pension board, and shall be accompanied by the lump-sum payment or an agreement as to installment payments herein required. 
    The pension board may authorize any such member to make the election herein provided at any time, and if made prior to retirement, such member shall, in addition to any lump-sum or installment payments required, pay to the board contributions on his entire salary or wages thereafter received at the rate provided in this act for monthly salary or wages in excess of that on which Social Security allowances are payable. 
    Amount of payments into fund; repayment before retirement. The employees of any city creating such pension fund and pension board shall pay into the board of pensions monthly an amount equal to two (2) percent of their monthly salaries or wages, and if council elects, by ordinance, to make such payments, an additional amount not to exceed one percent if deemed necessary by council to provide sufficient funds for payments to the surviving spouses of members who were retired on pension or killed in the service, which shall be applied to the purposes of the fund. Payment of the monthly amount or contribution herein mentioned shall cease and be discontinued at the time the beneficiary received the pension herein provided. If for any cause any employee contributing to the pension fund shall cease to be an employee of the city before the said employee becomes entitled to a pension, the total amount of the contributions paid into the pension fund by such employee shall be refunded to him or her in full, without interest. If any such employee shall have returned to him or her the amount contributed as aforesaid, and shall afterward reenter the employ of the city, said employee shall not be entitled to the pension designated until twenty (20) years after said reemployment, unless he or she shall return to the pension fund the amount withdrawn, in which event that period of twenty (20) years shall be computed from the time said employee first enters the service of the city. In the event of the death of any such employee, before the said employee becomes entitled to the pension aforesaid, the said total amount of contributions paid into the pension fund by said employee shall be paid over to the estate of said deceased employee. 
    Determination of liability upon extension of Social Security. Where a city has entered into an agreement with the commonwealth to place its employees under the federal Social Security Act, the pension board shall appoint an actuary and may fix his compensation. The actuary shall determine the present value of the liability on account of pensions payable under the provision of section 4343 of this Act to employees who are members of the system on the effective date of the agreement, and shall offset the value of any assets in the pension fund to determine the unfunded liability. The city may make such payments as it desires toward the unfunded liability until the accumulated reserve equals the present value of the liability. The actuary shall also determine the amount which shall be contributed, annually, into the fund on account of service of all new and original members subsequent to the effective date of the agreement. 
    Employees shall pay into the board of pensions, monthly, an amount equal to three and one-half (31/2) percent of that portion of monthly compensation on which Social Security allowances are payable and five (5) percent of any monthly compensation in excess of that on which social security allowances are payable. The remainder of the needed annual contribution for service subsequent to the date of the agreement, as shall be paid by it to the board of pensions by annual appropriations. The provisions of this section shall, in all applicable cases, supersede the provisions relating to contributions in section 4344 and section 4348 of this Act. 
    Payments by laborers optional. Any person holding a position in any such city as a laborer, at a per diem wage, shall not be compelled to pay or contribute toward the pension fund herein provided for, but shall have the option or choice of so doing and, in that event only, of becoming entitled to the pension provided by this Act. 
    Heads of departments to certify list of employees. The head of every department and office employing persons entitled to receive a pension shall certify to the board of pensions all persons so employed and the amount of salary or wages which are paid to said employees, together with dismissals, resignations, or terminations of service and, from the records of their office or department, shall furnish such other relevant information as the board of pensions shall require, in the case of a volunteer fireman, "head of department or office" shall mean the president or secretary of the board of trustees of the volunteer fire company involved. 
    Receipt, investment and payment of funds. It shall be the duty of the board of pensions to receive and retain and, when deemed advisable, to invest the funds payable in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision of this article, and to pay over by warrant or check the amount due to said employees. 
    Appropriations and contributions to fund. The council may annually set aside, apportion, and appropriate, out of all taxes and income of such city, unto the board of pensions, a sum sufficient to maintain the pensions or compensation due hereunder on account of the city contributions for all employees except volunteer firemen. On account of volunteer firemen who become members of the pension fund, the board of trustees of the volunteer fire company employing and paying them shall annually contribute to the board of pensions a sum equal to the same percentage of its participating payroll as the amount contributed by the city for the same year bears to its participating payroll. 
    Application. The benefits conferred by this subdivision of this article shall apply to all persons employed in any capacity by, or holding positions in, or, in the case of a volunteer fireman, rendering services recognized and accepted by, the cities creating a pension fund and pension board in accordance with its provisions, but this subdivision shall not apply to employees of such departments, bureaus, or offices as are otherwise protected by pension authorized by this Act. 
    Any volunteer fireman may become a member of such a pension fund, as of the date of his original employment or of the inception of the pension fund, whichever is later, upon his making back contributions, and if the volunteer fire company or board of trustees thereof employing and paying him agrees to contribute and contributes to the pension fund, from time to time, the sums hereinbefore required. 
    Computation of time of service. The time of service herein specified, namely, twenty (20) years, shall be computed from the time of the first or original employments, said employment to consist of service to the city and need not be continuous. 
    Funds payable to be free of attachment. The compensation or pension herein mentioned shall not be subject to attachment or execution, and shall be payable only to the beneficiary designated, and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer. 
    Definitions. The term or phrase "employee," "employed," by the city" or "in the employment of any city," as used in this section, is meant to include all persons in the service of cities creating a pension fund and a pension board in accordance with the provisions thereof, who are not now otherwise protected by pensions authorized by this act, and any volunteer fireman who becomes a member of the pension fund. 
    Volunteer fireman shall mean a driver of firefighting apparatus or ambulances, regularly employed and paid by a volunteer fire company, rendering services recognized and accepted by a city. 
    Beneficiaries of fund not to be employed by city. No person or persons who shall have become a beneficiary shall be employed by the said city any capacity, excepting in an office elected by popular vote, but during such elected term he or she shall not be entitled to a pension. 
(Ord. No. 13-01, §§ II-IX, 12-12-01) 
Sec. 2-170. - Limited vested benefit. 
(a)  Should a member of the pension fund terminate employment before reaching the date which would have been the member's earliest retirement date had the member continued employment by meeting the minimum age and minimum period of continuous service requirements but after having completed twelve (12) years of full-time service, the member shall be entitled to vest his or her retirement benefits subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  The member must file with the management board of the pension fund a written notice of his or her intention to vest;

The amount of retirement benefits the member is entitled to receive under this section shall be computed as follows: 
(1)  The initial determination of the member's base retirement benefits shall be computed on the salary indicated on the notice to vest; and 
(2)  The portion of the base retirement benefits due the member shall be determined by applying to the base amount the percentage that his or her years of service actually rendered bears to the years of service which would have been rendered had the member continued to be employed by the city until his or her earliest retirement date.

Sec. 2-182. - Pensions and service increments. 
(a)  Payments of pensions shall not be a charge on any fund in the treasury of the city or under its control save the firemen's pension fund herein provided for. The basis of the pension of a member shall be determined by the monthly salary of the member at the date of retirement, or the highest average annual salary which he received during any five (5) years of service preceding retirement, whichever is the higher, whether for disability, or by reason of age or service, and except as to service increment provided for in subsection (b) of this section, shall be one-half the annual salary of such member at the time of retirement computed at such monthly or average annual rate, whichever is higher. Lump sum vacation pay is not salary and, therefore, shall not be included in any calculation of annual salary for the purpose of computation of pensions. In the case of the payment of pensions to members for permanent injury incurred in service, and to families of members killed or who die in service, the amount and commencement of the payment of pensions shall be fixed by regulations of the board. Such regulations shall not take into consideration the amount and duration of workmen's compensation allowed by law. Payments to widows of members retired on pension or killed in the service on or after January 1, 1960, or who die in the service on or after January 1, 1968, shall be the amount payable to the member or which would have been payable and had he been retired at the time of his death. 
    The pension benefit of firefighters retiring on or after January 1, 1994, shall be computed as a percentage equal to two and one-half (21/2) percent of each year of service up to twenty (20) years, plus one and one-quarter (11/4) for each year of service in excess of twenty (20) years reduced by one-third ( 1/3 ) of one percent for each month by which the benefit commencement date precedes the retiree's fiftieth birthday. Effective January 1, 1997, there shall be a cap of seventy-five (75) percent on the service increment for years of service in excess of twenty (20) years. Said cap shall be reduced by seventy (70) percent effective June 29, 1999. It is understood that the first one hundred dollars ($100.00) of this figure shall count as the service increment as required in subsection (b)(1) of this section, and as required under 53 P.S. section 39322(b)(1). 
(b)  In addition to the pension which is authorized to be paid from the firemen's pension fund by this division and notwithstanding the limitations therein placed upon such pensions and upon contributions, every contributor who shall become entitled to the pension shall also be entitled to the payment of a "service increment" in accordance with and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth: 
(1)  Service increment shall be the sum obtained by computing the number of whole years after having served the minimum required by this division during which a contributor has been employed by the city and paid out by the city treasury and multiplying the number of years so computed by an amount equal to one-fortieth of the retirement allowance which has become payable to such contributor in accordance with the provisions of this division. In computing the service increment, no employment after the contributor has reached the age of sixty-five (65) years shall be included, and no service increment shall be paid in excess of one hundred ($100.00) per month. 
(2)  Each contributor shall pay into the pension fund a monthly sum in addition to his pension contribution, which shall not exceed the sum of one dollar ($1.00) per month; and provided, that such service increment contribution shall not be paid after a contributor has reached the age of sixty-five (65) years. 
(3)  Any person who is a member of the department on the effective date of the ordinance from which this division was derived who has already reached the age of sixty-five (65) years shall have his service increment computed on the years of employment prior to the date of reaching his sixty-fifth birthday. 
(4)  Service increment contributions shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as pensions, and may be withdrawn in full, without interest, by persons who leave the employment of such city, subject to the same conditions by which retirement contributions may be withdrawn, or by persons who retire before becoming entitled to any service increment. 
(5)  All members of the bureau of fire who are now contributors to the pension fund and all those employed by the city hereafter, if required to become contributors to the pension fund, shall be subject to the provisions of this division. 
(c)  For the purpose of computation of pension there shall be added to the base monthly salary one-twelfth of the total additional compensation received for service out of rank, overtime, night differential and holiday pay earned during the twelve (12) calendar month period which preceded the effective date as of which the pension first became due and payable. At no time shall the purchase of accumulated sick pay buy-back be included in the computation of any pension under this division. This subsection is to be retroactive to January 1, 1969.

Sec. 2-184. - Separation from service prior to retirement. 
    If for any cause any member of the bureau of fire contributing to the pension fund shall cease to be a member of the bureau of fire before he becomes entitled to a pension, the total amount of the contributions paid into the pension fund by such member shall be refunded to him in full without interest. If any such member shall have returned to him the amount contributed, and shall afterward again become a member of the bureau of fire, he shall not be entitled to the pension designated until twenty (20) years after his reemployment, unless he shall return to the pension fund the amount withdrawn, in which event the period of twenty (20) years shall be computed from the time the member first became a member of the bureau of fire, excluding therefrom any period of time during which the member was not employed by the bureau of fire. In the event of the death of a member of the bureau of fire not in the line of service before the member becomes entitled to the pension aforesaid and such member is not survived by a widow or family entitled to payments as hereinbefore provided, the total amount of contributions paid into the pension fund by the member shall be paid over to his estate. In case of the death of a member not in the line of service before the member becomes entitled to the pension aforesaid and such member is survived by a widow eligible to receive benefits as hereinbefore provided, the total amount of contributions paid into the pension fund by the member shall be paid over to such widow.

(c)  The spouse of a member of the police force or a member who retires on pension who dies or if no spouse survives or if such person survives and subsequently dies, then the child or children under the age of eighteen (18) years of a member of the police force or a member who retires on pension who dies on or after the effective date of this amendment, shall, during her or his lifetime, or until reaching the age of eighteen (18) years in the case of a child or children, be entitled to receive a pension calculated at the rate of fifty (50) percent of the pension the member was receiving or would have been receiving had he or she been retired at the time of his or her death and may receive the pension the member was receiving or would have been receiving had he or she been retired at the time of his or her death. 
(d)  Any police officer who has less than ten (10) years of service and who dies or is totally disabled due to injuries or mental incapacities not in line of duty and is unable to perform the duties of a police officer may be entitled to a pension of twenty-five (25) percent of his or her annual compensation. For death or injuries received after ten (10) years of service, the compensation may be fifty (50) percent of his or her annual compensation.

    Increase of allowances after retirement. Any city may, at any time, at its discretion, upon the recommendation of the persons having custody and management of the police pension fund, increase the allowances of persons receiving allowances of any kind from the police pension fund by reason of and after the termination of the services of any member of said fund. Such increases shall [be] in conformity with a uniform scale, which may be based on the cost of living, but the total of any such allowances shall not at any time exceed one-half of the current salary being paid patrolmen of the highest pay grade. 
    Inalienable rights in fund.

Before commencing any work, other than to address the condemned property as set forth in section 7-357(a)(1) of this article, the owner of the condemned property shall post with the city a performance bond or cashier's check, acceptable to the city, in an amount sufficient to cover any and all costs necessary for the city to demolish the condemned property in the event the condemned property is not issued a certificate of occupancy within the time frame represented by the owner and agreed to by the city, or a reasonable extension granted as permitted in this article (the "rehab timeframe"). The performance bond or cashiers check shall be held by the city until the certificate of occupancy is issued or until the rehab timeframe has expired, whichever is earlier. If the certificate of occupancy is issued, then the performance bond or cashiers check shall be returned to the owner. If the rehab timeframe expires prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the city may immediately accept public bids to demolish the condemned property and use the cashiers check or proceeds from the performance bond, whichever may be applicable, to cover the costs of the demolition. No person or entity will be permitted to commence any work on any condemned property unless and until the proper performance bond or cashiers check is presented to the city. 
(1)  Determination of amount of bond or check. The city reserves the right to consult with and/or seek an estimate from a qualified demolition contractor, who is currently licensed by the city, to confirm the proper and required amount of the performance bond or cashiers check.

(2)  Appeal of amount of bond or check. In the event the owner does not agree with the amount of the performance bond or cashiers check, the owner shall be permitted to appeal the matter to the city's housing board of appeals within ten (10) business days of the owner being notified of the amount due. In the event the appeal is not filed within ten (10) business days, the amount of the performance bond or cashiers check shall be conclusive. In order for the appeal of the amount of the performance bond or cashiers check to be valid, the owner must post the amount not in dispute and commence work in accordance with this article and with the requirements set forth in the Wilkes-Barre Code of Ordinances, generally. 
(3)  No automatic stay during appeal period. Any appeal by the owner shall not postpone, or act as a stay to the requirement that the owner commence work on the condemned property in question in accordance with this article or with the Wilkes-Barre City Code of Ordinances, generally. 
(4)  Cost for appeal. Any appeal made hereunder shall require a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) unless the owner claims in forma pauperis status, which shall require the completion of a financial statement and affidavit verifying that the owner does not have the means to make the one hundred dollar ($100.00) appeal fee, at which time, if verified, the said fee shall be waived. 
(d)  Full payment of applicable real estate taxes and sanitary/recycling fees. Prior to the issuance of any permits for the rehabilitation of any condemned property, the owner must show proof that all outstanding real estate taxes, for the city, the county and Wilkes-Barre Area School District, are paid in full. Additionally, the owner shall show proof that all city and Wyoming Valley Sanitary Authority sewer and recycling fees are paid in full.

The owner and contractor shall be jointly and severally responsible and liable for notifying the city for all inspections and, ultimately, for the issuance of certificate of occupancy. 
(f)  Extension of time to complete rehabilitation of condemned property. In the event that the rehabilitation of the condemned property exceeds one (1) year from the date the property is deemed a "condemned property," the code enforcement office may grant the owner an additional four (4) months in which to complete the rehabilitation. After that four-month extension, all future extensions may only be granted with approval of city council. City council may seek guidance and/or a recommendation from any third party, if necessary or desired, including, but not limited to, the city's engineers, the code officers, or the director of operations. 
(g)  Form to be completed. Prior to the issuance of permits for the rehabilitation of the condemned property, the owner shall complete the form available in the city's code enforcement office which shall state, inter alia, the following: 
(1)  Name of the owner of the property;

Editor's note- Ord. No. 40-92, enacted Dec. 10, 1992, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, codification of §§ 1-9 of Ord. No. 40-92 as superseding former Art. III, §§ 19-32-19-35, which pertained to similar subject matter, is at the discretion of the editor. The deleted provisions derived from Ord. No. 27-81, §§ 1-3, adopted Sept. 24, 1981; Ord.

Sec. 19-32. - Purpose.

Sec. 19-117. - Graffiti deemed nuisance. 
    Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, fences, gates and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance. 
(1)  Although it is appropriate, where possible, to request that the courts require people who are convicted of acts of defacement and vandalism involving application of graffiti to public or private property to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed, obtaining convictions for such acts is difficult because the offenses can be committed so very quickly and secretively that witnesses to the acts are frequently nonexistent. 
(2)  Although the public should be encouraged to cooperate in the elimination of graffiti by reporting the same to proper authorities, it is also important to eliminate the presence of graffiti from the community so that the product of the illegal acts of those involved in application of graffiti is not visible and the property on which the graffiti is located and surrounding properties do not suffer diminution of value. 
(Ord. No. 9-95, § 1, 4-27-95; Ord. No. 59-04, § I, 11-18-04)

    "Unauthorized," as used herein, shall mean the marking, etching, scratching, drawing of any inscription, word, character, figure, or design directly upon the surface of any public building, structure, facility without the express prior written approval of the public authority or the marking, etching, scratching, drawing or painting of a inscription, word, etching, scratching, drawing or painting of an inscription, word, character, figure or design directly upon the surface of a private building or structure without the express prior approval of the owner or person in possession of such private building or structure. 
(Ord. No. 9-95, § 2, 4-27-95) 
Sec. 19-119. - Prohibition. 
    It is hereby prohibited and it shall be unlawful for any person to paint, chalk, ink, or otherwise apply graffiti or other inscribed material on public or privately owned real property within this city. Said action shall be determined to be a nuisance and violation to the city health code. 
(Ord. No. 9-95, § 3, 4-27-95) 
Sec. 19-120. - Penalty.

The property owner shall have fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or the same will be subject to abatement by the city. 
(b)  The notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall cause a written notice to be served upon the owner(s) of the affected premises, as such owners' name and address appears on the last property tax assessment rolls of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this section may be served in any one (1) of the following manners:

Sec. 19-123. - Debt/lien.

(Ord. No. 59-04, § III, 11-18-04)

a.  A certificate or, at the discretion of the municipality, a verbal notification which shall be confirmed in writing by the insurer to the effect that, as of the date specified in the request, there are no delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges against the property and that, as of the date of the treasurer's certificate or verbal notification, no municipality has certified any amount as total costs incurred by the municipality for the removal, repair or securing of a building or other structure on the property; or

For the purposes of this subclause, the municipality shall certify to the treasurer the total amount, if any, of such costs. A tax, assessment, penalty or user charge becomes delinquent at the time and on the date a lien could otherwise have been filed against the property by the municipality under applicable law. 
(2)  a. 
Upon the receipt of a certificate pursuant to clause (1)a. of this subsection, the insurance company, association or exchange shall pay the claim of the named insured in accordance with the policy terms, unless the loss agreed to between the named insured and the company, association or exchange equals or exceeds sixty (60) per centum of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or other structure. In the case of such a loss, the insurance company, association or exchange, the insured property owner and the municipality shall follow the procedures set forth in subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
b.

The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies, associations or exchanges insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the transfer to the municipality shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms. The named insured may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure after the transfer, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured if the municipality has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure. This subsection only applies to municipalities that have adopted an ordinance authorizing the procedure described in this subsection and subsection (d) of this section and applies only to fire losses that occur after the adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives. Such ordinance shall designate the officer authorized to carry out the duties of this section. 
(e)  Placement of proceeds in separate fund; return of funds to named insured when repairs, removal or securing of building completed.

When transferring the funds as required in this section, an insurance company, association or exchange shall provide the municipality with the name and address of the named insured, whereupon the municipality shall contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds have been received by the municipality and notify the named insured that the procedures under this subsection shall be followed. The fund shall be returned to the named insured when repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure have been completed and the required proof received by the designated officer if the municipality has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing. If the municipality has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund, and, if excess funds remain, the municipality shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured. 
(f)  Ability of municipality to recover deficiencies. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of a municipality to recover any deficiency. Further, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the municipality and the named insured from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated. 
(g)  Authority of city to adopt procedures and regulations. The city council may by resolution adopt procedures and regulations to implement Act 98 of 1992 and this section and may by resolution fix reasonable fees to be charged for municipal activities or services provided pursuant to Act 98 of 1992 and this section, including, but not limited to, issuance of certificates and bills, performance of inspections and opening separate fluid accounts.

In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by clause (2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform form provided by the political subdivision. 
(2)  With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or by the political subdivision that the person has received earned income and net profits from all sources within the political subdivision equal to or in excess of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00) in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in excess of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00) in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax from the person under clause (3).

The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification under clause (2), a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period.

(4)  Except as provided in clause (2), it is the intent of this subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee from the local services tax. 
(c)  Refunds.

Sec. 28-22. - Duty of employers to collect. 
(a)  Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return and payment thereof to the collector. Further, each employer is hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such services are performed within the political subdivision. 
(b)  A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section.

(c)  No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by more than one (1) political subdivision during each payroll period. 
(d)  In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of employment within two (2) weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED. 
(e)  The tax shall be no more than fifty-two dollars ($52.00) on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer. 
(f)  No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the employee's principal office or where the employee is principally employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 28-21 of this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in accordance with this article. 
(g)  Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.

Sec. 28-23. - Returns. 
    Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the collector. If an employer fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been originally levied against the employer. 
(Ord. No. 31-2007, § 8, 12-13-07) 
Sec. 28-24. - Dates for determining tax liability and payment. 
    Each employer shall use his employment and payroll records from the first day of January to March 31 each year for determining the number of employees from whom said tax shall be deducted and paid over to the collector on or before April 30 of the same calendar year. Supplemental reports shall be made by each employer on July 30, October 30 and January 31 for new employees as reflected on his employment and payroll records from April 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30 and October 1 to December 31, and payments on these supplemental reports shall be made on July 30, October 30 and January 31, respectively. 
(Ord. No. 31-2007, § 9, 12-13-07) 
Sec. 28-25. - Self-employed individuals. 
    Each self-employed individual who has earned income or realizes net profit, as those terms are defined herein, within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with this article and pay the tax due to the collector on or before the thirtieth day following the end of each quarter. 
(Ord. No. 31-2007, § 10, 12-13-07) 
Sec. 28-26. - Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or employed in more than one political subdivision. 
(a)  The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the following order: 
(1)  First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her principal office or is principally employed; 
(2)  Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision; 
(3)  Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions. 
(Ord. No. 31-2007, § 11, 12-13-07) 
Sec. 28-27. - Nonresidents subject to tax.

In all cases he shall value, or cause to be valued, the property at the actual value thereof. In arriving at such value the price for which any property would separately bona fide sell, or the price at which any property may bona fide actually have been sold, shall be considered, but shall not be controlling.

Sec. 30-30. - Purpose and policy. 
    Wilkes-Barre City (hereinafter the "municipality") owns and operates a wastewater collection system which is subject to a service agreement with the Wyoming Valley Sanitary Authority for the collection and treatment of wastes and sewage collected by such system and contributed by residents of municipality. 
    This article sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributors into the wastewater collection system and enables the municipality and the authority to comply with all applicable state and federal laws as required by the Federal Clean Water Act of 1977, the General Pretreatment Regulations (Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403), the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, and the provisions of the service agreement. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater collection and treatment system which will interfere with the operation of the system, contaminate the resulting sludge, be difficult to treat by conventional means or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving streams or the atmosphere, causing pollution; 
(3)  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludges from the system; and 
(4)  To provide for equitable distribution of costs occasioned by the acceptance of industrial or other wastes of unusual characteristics. 
    This article provides for the regulation of contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the establishment of standards for discharge of wastes; by authorizing the issuance of permits to certain non-domestic users; by providing general requirements for all users; by authorizing monitoring and enforcement activities; by requiring certain reporting by users; and by providing for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.

Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the WVSA for review, and shall be approved by the WVSA before construction of the facility. No user who commences discharge of industrial wastewater to the sanitary sewer system after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge protection, containment and countermeasure procedures have been approved by the WVSA. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
(b)  In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the WVSA of the incident. The notification shall include location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions being taken. 
(c)  Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the executive director a detailed report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WVSA, its facilities, or any other person or property; nor shall notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. Failure to notify the executive director of an accidental discharge shall constitute a separate and distinct violation of this article. 
(d)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of an accidental discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may be present in an area where an accidental discharge may occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure as well as the containment and countermeasures developed by the user to mitigate and control any such discharge.

    In the case of a non-domestic user that, for reasons of emergency maintenance, equipment failure, or other similar unforeseen event beyond the user's reasonable control, must discharge prohibited, high strength, or other wastewater of unusual strength, character or volume, the user may apply to the executive director for an emergency discharge permit. The executive director may issue such a permit, on terms and conditions as he deems appropriate, upon his review of the information provided and in his sole discretion. No discharge of the unusual wastewater may be made until and unless an emergency discharge permit has been issued. An emergency discharge permit shall not be issued for longer than thirty (30) days and may be renewed only after a new application has been made.

In the case of a revocation, the user may only receive a new permit by going through the application process as stated in section 30-65 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 11-2012, 4-26-2012) 
Sec. 30-95. - Suspension of sewer service. 
    The municipality and/or the WVSA may suspend the wastewater treatment service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the WVSA, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference or pass through at the WVSA's treatment plant or causes the WVSA or municipality to violate or be in danger of violating any condition of an NPDES permit or state-issued water quality management permit. 
    Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the municipality may, and the WVSA is authorized to, take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance or obstruction of the sewer connection from the user's property, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer system or the WVSA facilities or endangerment to any individuals. The WVSA or the municipality shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service only upon satisfactory proof of elimination of the non-complying discharge. All costs associated with the severance and/or reconnection of a sewer shall be incurred by the user. 
(Ord. No. 11-2012, 4-26-2012) 
Sec. 30-96. - Civil penalties.

Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue to occur shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. 
    Municipality recognizes that the WVSA has independent civil penalty authority under the provisions of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works Penalty Law (Act 9 of 1992, 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq.). Any violation of this article shall constitute a violation of the WVSA's EPA-approved industrial pretreatment program and subject an industrial user to the penalties provided thereunder. Should WVSA choose to assess a civil penalty under its independent authority against a user who violates any provision of this article, municipality shall cooperate to the extent necessary to aid WVSA in such an action. 
    In addition to the civil penalties provided herein, the municipality and/or the WVSA may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporters' fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this article, the WVSA rules and regulations, or any permit issued hereunder.

    For the interpretation of zoning district boundaries, the following subsections shall apply if or when a determination is not made by the Zoning Officer. 
403.1  Zoning Hearing Board. 
If uncertainty exists as to the boundary of any zoning district shown upon the Official Zoning Map, the Zoning Hearing Board shall determine the location of such boundary according to the guidelines set forth in Section 403.2. 
403.2  Guidelines. 
(A)  Zoning district boundary lines are generally intended to follow or parallel the center line of streets, streams and railroads; and the lot or property lines as they exist on a recorded deed or plan in the Luzerne County Recorder of Deeds Office at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, unless such zoning district boundary lines are fixed by dimensions as shown on the Official Zoning Map.

(C)  If the guidelines as stated above fail to provide and establish the boundary of a zoning district, a survey of the property or area of land in question shall be made by a registered surveyor, with the cost of the survey paid by the party who is questioning or contesting the boundary location. 
Section 404. - Classes of zoning districts. 
    For the purpose of this Ordinance, the City of Wilkes-Barre is hereby divided into Zoning Districts with the intended legislative intent as designated below: 
R-1 Residential Single-Family District: 
The provisions for the R-1 District are intended to create, preserve and enhance areas composed primarily of single-family residences built at relatively lower densities. These Districts are still stable and essentially in sound condition and should be protected from intrusion of uses and activities incompatible with the character of single-family areas. It is also intended that these Districts have adequate light and space around the buildings and be well landscaped, with mature trees and shrubbery, so that they will be continuing assets to the City and will promote a stable, healthy, and safe environment. 
R-2 Residential Two-Family District: 
The provisions for the R-2 District are intended to create, preserve and enhance areas that are primarily residential in character but which are composed of a variety of types of residences built at medium densities. These districts will be more densely built up, but will still have adequate light and space around the buildings and be well landscaped with mature trees and shrubbery. 
R-3 Residential Multi-Family District: 
The provisions for the R-3 District are intended to create, preserve, and enhance areas of the City that are primarily residential in character but built to higher densities than any other R District. They may be older areas or newly developed or redeveloped areas where the plan of the City indicates that it is feasible and desirable to develop certain areas with medium to high concentrations of population due to the availability of adequate public facilities and utilities, the adequacy of the road and transportation systems and the suitability of the environment. It is also the intent that some nonresidential uses will be permitted in these districts if they are not incompatible with the character of a higher density residential area, but, are instead complementary and would enhance the quality of such a neighborhood. 
C-1 Commercial, Office District: 
The provisions for the C-1 District are intended to create, preserve and enhance areas close to the central business district, with a wide range of retail and service establishments, and are also intended to create and enhance areas with central offices and residential structures of a medium to high density which will supplement the central business district and will promote a stable, healthy, and safe environment. 
C-2 Commercial Community District: 
The provisions for the C-2 District are intended to create, preserve and enhance areas with a wide range of retail and service establishments typically appropriate along major traffic arteries, due to their dependence on automobile traffic for business. The C-2 districts are also intended to preserve and enhance areas that have long been established as business areas, but are secondary to the central business district which contain a mixture of business similar in nature to those found in both the central business district and in the neighborhood business districts. 
C-3 Commercial, Central District: 
The provisions for the C-3 District are intended to create, preserve and enhance the central business district as a regional center of shopping, employment, office, financial, government, hotels, entertainment, and culture. 
C-4 Commercial, Heavy District: 
The provisions for the C-4 District are intended to create, preserve and enhance areas devoted to highway-oriented uses at a high density. Such districts may include commercial services which are incompatible with the central business district and residential districts because of their need for extensive parking and loading areas of their external impact or surrounding areas. C-4 districts will be greatly located along or near major traffic corridors. 
C-N Commercial Neighborhood District: 
The provisions for the C-N District are intended to create, preserve and enhance business areas to serve residential neighborhoods, They are generally districts which contain several small-scale retail establishments, in small clustered groupings, serving frequently recurring needs in locations convenient to residents. 
M-1 Industrial, Light District: 
The provisions for the M-1 District are intended to create, preserve and enhance areas intended for light industrial uses and commercial services using previously prepared materials not objectionable or injurious due to smoke, noise, odors, vibrations, etc. such uses have activities which have limited external impact on surrounding areas because of their appearance and method of operation. 
M-2 Industrial, Heavy District: 
The provisions for the M-2 District are intended to create, preserve, and enhance areas intended for heavy industry, using raw materials. Such uses are more intense than uses in the M-1 classification and are located farther from residential neighborhoods so as not to be detrimental to surrounding properties. M-2 districts are located so that they have access to suitable and adequate railroad, highway, or other transportation and shipping facilities. 
S-1 Special Purpose District: 
The provisions for the S-1 District are intended to create, preserve and enhance areas intended for use by the public. Such uses include colleges or universities, schools of music, art, dancing, central offices and residential uses of a high density. It is also the intent of this section to include public and quasi-public uses of a governmental, welfare, religious, recreational, and cultural nature. Because of the unique nature of these districts, special controls concerning landscaping, transportation services and off-street parking are designed to promote a stable, healthy, and safe environment. 
OSP Open Space and Park Zone: 
The provisions of the OSP District are designed to preserve and promote green spaces throughout the City to enhance the environmental quality of life for City residents. Areas suitable for an OSP classification include public parks and open space to meet capable of meeting the passive and active recreational needs of residents.

1.  That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.

Section 103. - Application of the Ordinance. 
    103.1 No subdivision or land development of any lot, tract or parcel of land shall be made, and no street, sanitary sewer, water main, gas, oil or electric transmission line or other facilities in connection therewith shall be laid out, constructed, opened or dedicated for public use or travel or for the common use of occupants of buildings abutting thereon, except in accordance with the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance regulations adopted herein. 
    103.2 No lot in a proposed subdivision or land development may be sold and no zoning permit to erect any building upon land in a subdivision or land development may be issued unless and until the following conditions are met: 
(a)  Final approval of plans have been granted by the planning commission; 
(b)  All conditions established by the planning commission in granting final approval have been met; 
(c)  The final plan, as approved, is filed with the Luzerne County recorder of deeds;

Section 104. - Status of pending subdivision and land development applications. 
    From the time an application for approval of a subdivision or land development, whether preliminary or final, is duly filed in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, and [if] while such application is pending approval or disapproval an amendment to this Ordinance, the Zoning Ordinance or any other applicable ordinance shall affect the decision on such application adversely to the applicant [, then] the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in accordance with the provisions of all applicable ordinances as they stood at the time the application was duly filed. When an application is, however, properly and finally denied, any subsequent application shall be subject to any amendments to this Ordinance, the Zoning Ordinance and any other applicable ordinance and/or regulations. 
Section 105. - Status of approved subdivision or land development applications. 
    105.1 When an application for approval of a subdivision or land development, whether preliminary or final, has been approved, no subsequent amendment to this Ordinance, the Zoning Ordinance or any other applicable ordinance shall be applied to adversely affect the right of the applicant to commence and to complete any aspect of the approved development in accordance with the terms of such approval within five (5) years from such approval. If final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the five-year period shall be counted from the date of the preliminary approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary approval, the terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they stood at the time when the application for such approval was duly filed. 
    105.2 Where the applicant has substantially completed the required improvements as depicted upon the final plat within the aforesaid five-year limit, or any extension thereof as may be granted by the planning commission, no change of municipal ordinance or plan enacted subsequent to the date of filing of the preliminary plat shall modify or revoke any aspect of the approved final plat pertaining to zoning classification or density, lot, building, street or utility location. 
Section 106. - Phased development exceeding five years. 
    In the case of a preliminary plat calling for the installation of improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by the landowner with the preliminary plat delineating all proposed sections as well as deadlines within which applications for final plat approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be updated annually by the applicant on or before the anniversary of the preliminary plat approval, until final plat approval of the final section has been granted and any modification in the aforesaid schedule shall be subject to approval of the planning commission in its discretion. 
    Each section in any residential subdivision or land development, except for the last section, shall contain a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan, unless a lesser percentage is approved by the planning commission in its discretion. Provided the landowner has not defaulted with regard to or violated any of the conditions of the preliminary plat approval, including compliance with landowner's aforesaid schedule of submission of final plats for the various sections; then the protections afforded by substantially completing the improvements depicted upon the final plat within five (5) years, as contained in Section 105, shall apply and for any section or sections beyond the initial section in which the required improvements have not been substantially completed within said five-year period the aforesaid protections shall apply for an additional term or terms of three (3) years from the date of final plat approval for each section. 
    Failure of landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of final plats for the various sections shall subject any such section to any and all changes in zoning, subdivision and other governing ordinance enacted by the municipality subsequent to the date of the initial preliminary plan submission.

    A revision or resubdivision of a plan of record shall be considered as a new subdivision and shall come under the jurisdiction of this Ordinance. 
Section 108. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application, the provisions of the Ordinance shall be held to the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. When provisions, standards and specifications of this Ordinance differ from those of any other ordinance, statute or regulation, the more restrictive or higher standards shall apply. 
    The provisions of this Ordinance are not intended to abrogate any private easement, covenant or any other restriction of record; provided, that where the provisions of this Ordinance are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant or other restriction, the applicable provisions of this Ordinance shall govern. 
Section 109. - Modification of required standards. 
    109.1 If any provision of this Ordinance is shown by the applicant or his engineer or land surveyor to be unreasonable of application due to exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, or where strict compliance with any requirement of this Ordinance would cause practical difficulty or exceptional or undue hardship not of his making, or when alternative standards can be demonstrated to provide equal or better results, the planning commission may grant a modification to the literal requirements of such provision, provided that such modification is the minimum modification required to grant relief. Granting such modification shall not be contrary to the public interest and the intent of this Ordinance shall be observed. 
    109.2 Any request for a modification shall be submitted in writing and shall accompany and be deemed part of the plan, preliminary or final, as the case may be. Such request shall state in full the circumstances and facts of unreasonableness and hardship on which the request is based, the provision(s) or requirement(s) of this Ordinance in question and the exact modification(s) requested. 
    109.3 All proposals for modification of provisions or requirements of this Ordinance shall be first approved by the planning commission.

No judgement shall be commenced or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a violation to the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgement, the municipality may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the district justice determining that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this Ordinance to have believed that there was no such violation. Under such circumstances, there shall be deemed to have been only one (1) such violation until the fifth day following the date of the termination of a violation by the district justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. 
    The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per-diem judgment pending a final adjudication of the violation and judgment. Nothing contained within this section shall be construed or interpreted to grant any person or entity other than the municipality the right to commence action for enforcement pursuant to this section. 
    In addition to other remedies, the city may institute and maintain appropriate actions by law or equity to restrain, correct or abate violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The description by metes and bounds to the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided. 
    The city may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real property in violation of this Ordinance. The authority to deny such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants: 
(1)  The owner of record at the time of such violation. 
(2)  The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation. 
(3)  The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether the current owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation. 
(4)  The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.

    All ordinances, or any parts thereof, which are inconsistent or in conflict with this Ordinance are hereby repealed. 
Section 115. - Severability. 
    The provisions of this Ordinance are severable. If any part of this Ordinance is declared to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall be unaffected thereby. It is the intention of the council of the City of Wilkes-Barre that this Ordinance would have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid part not been included.

    822.6 Drainage easements may be incorporated into lots or established separately and apart therefrom. To minimize sheet flow of stormwater across lots located along the lower side or roads or streets, and to divert flow away from building areas, the cross-section of the street as constructed shall provide for parallel ditches, swales or curbing on the lower side which shall discharge only at drainage easements. 
    822.7 The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent property shall not be altered nor shall the rate of water runoff be increased as a result of development, unless design measures are incorporated to prevent damage and appropriate drainage easement is obtained from the affected adjoining land owner. 
    822.8 No stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall be so diverted as to overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or the need for additional drainage structures on other private properties or public lands, without complete approval of provisions being made by the developer for properly handling such conditions, including water runoff impoundments, if necessary. 
    822.9 Storm drainage facilities shall be designed not only to handle the anticipated peak discharge from the property being subdivided, but also the runoff that will occur from the property at a higher elevation in the same watershed. 
    822.10 Where a subdivision or land development is traversed by a watercourse, a drainage easement shall be provided conforming substantially to the line of such watercourse of such width as will be adequate to preserve the unimpaired flow of natural drainage.

    822.14 Whenever storm sewers are required by the planning commission, such storm sewer system shall be separate from the sanitary sewer system. Storm sewer facilities shall be provided where the planning commission, with the advice of the city engineer, determines that surface drainage facilities are inadequate to prevent excessive erosion and lot or road maintenance problems. 
    822.15 Drainage easements shall be provided as follows: 
(a)  Drainage easements shall be provided adjacent to street rights-of-way, streams, side property lines and rear property lines as required by the planning commission. 
(b)  Drainage easements shall be minimum width of: 
(1)  Ten (10) feet adjacent to a street right-of-way plus the width of any required pipe or other necessary improvements; 
(2)  Fifteen (15) feet when following side and rear lot lines. Such easements shall to the fullest extent possible, either immediately adjoin or be centered on such lot lines; or 
(3)  One hundred (100) feet from any recognized boundary of a 100-year floodplain or a recognized high-water mark of any water course or body of water.

Section 823. - Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. 
    A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The city engineer shall give approval to the necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and specifications assuming conditions of maximum runoff rate calculated by the applicant and reviewed by the city engineer. The calculation of this runoff rate shall take into account any land use and development regulations including runoff controls in effect in the tributary areas. 
Section 824. - Effect of downstream drainage areas. 
    No stormwater runoff or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to overload existing drainage systems, or create potential flooding or the need for additional drainage structures on other private properties or public lands, without approved provisions being made by the developer for properly handling such conditions. The planning commission may withhold approval of the subdivision until provisions have been made for the improvement of said potential conditions. No subdivisions shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility. 
Section 825. - Stormwater detention. 
    825.1 Areas of extremely poor drainage should be discouraged by the planning commission. 
    825.2 Detention facilities shall be used whenever increased runoff from the land development would overload drainage systems or cause significant increases in flood levels in any watercourses downstream. This will be determined by comparing the increase in runoff caused by the land development with the existing runoff rates and capacity of downstream drainage systems and watercourses. 
    825.3 Whenever detention facilities are required, facilities will be designed to provide that the peak runoff rate at all points of discharge from the site, when developed, will not exceed the peak runoff rate as each of those points prior to development unless existing or planned detention facilities located elsewhere in the same drainage basin will provide that the peak runoff rate from the drainage basin after the site is developed will not exceed the peak runoff rate prior to development. 
    825.4 Where detention facilities are included as part of the storm drainage system, the following provisions will apply: 
(a)  Detention ponds shall be designed so that they return to normal conditions within approximately twelve (12) hours after the termination of the storm, unless the city engineer finds that downstream conditions may warrant other design criteria for stormwater release. 
(b)  The developer shall demonstrate that such ponds are designed, protected and/or located to assure that public safety is maximized and health problems are prevented. 
(c)  The developer shall verify that the operation of the detention facilities will not aggravate potential downstream peaking conditions. 
(d)  Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided for detention facilities to handle runoff in excess of design flows. 
(e)  If the lands of the proposed land development will remain in common ownership, the developer shall provide written assurances to the municipality that the detention ponds will be properly maintained. 
(f)  If the lands of the proposed land development will be conveyed to two (2) or more separate owners, the developer shall provide written assurances to the municipality that the detention ponds will be properly maintained or dedicate the land on which the detention ponds are located to the municipality which shall then be responsible for maintaining the detention ponds. 
Section 826. - Improvement specifications of drainage facilities. 
    826.1 Inlets shall be designed and/or located to prevent hazardous conditions for vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than six hundred (600) feet in the gutter. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point and basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. 
    826.2 In addition to the design and construction standards as set forth in Exhibit A [6] of this Ordinance, the city engineer shall add additional specifications for: 
(a)  Spacing and type of inlets and manholes;

A nonresidential subdivision or land development shall also be subject to receiving appropriate zoning approval, based upon the submission of a site plan, zoning application and any other appropriate information. Zoning approval may proceed simultaneously with subdivision/land development approval. 
    827.2 In addition to the principles and standards in these regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions or land developments, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed: 
(a)  Street right-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon. 
(b)  Special requirements may be imposed by the local government with respect to street, curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction. 
(c)  Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated. 
(d)  Special requirements may be imposed by the planning commission with respect to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and stormwater drainage. 
(e)  Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision, including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or potential residential development, and provisions for a permanently landscaped buffer strip when necessary. 
(f)  Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or potential residential areas.

(Ord. No. 4-2011, § 101, 3-24-11) 
Sec. 1021. - Statement of findings. 
    The governing body of the City of Wilkes-Barre finds that: 
A.  Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources. 
B.  A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the protection of people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment. 
C.  Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality. 
D.  Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). 
(Ord. No. 4-2011, § 102, 3-24-11)

b.  20% of existing impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow in the model for existing conditions. 
B.  When Design Storm Method CG-1 guidelines are not used, the Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual 1 ) has been modified to accommodate two (2) inches of permanently removed runoff volume. This method (provided below) is independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed, For new impervious surfaces: 
1.  The first two (2) inches of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow (i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth). Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. 
2.  Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0,5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated. 
3.  Facilities, to the greatest extent possible and subject to the City Engineer's discretion, shall be designed to drain the permanently removed runoff volume in a period no less than twenty-four (24) hours and no greater than seventy-two (72) hours. 
4.  Runoff volume in excess of two (2) inches shall be safely conveyed to existing stormwater collection systems or streams, in the direction of the existing drainage course. 
5.  This method is exempt from the requirements of Section 3041, Rate Controls. 
C.  Before infiltration is proposed on a site, site conditions shall be evaluated by a qualified design professional through subsurface investigation and testing to determine if site conditions are suitable to support proposed infiltration facilities to manage runoff. If it is determined that infiltration is not feasible due to physical constraints of the site, or will adversely impact the environment as demonstrated by the presence of acid mine drainage, sinkhole formation, or other serious environmental issues, then the above volume controls must be achieved through surface BMP mitigation. Reference the BMP Manual 1 for alternative mitigation measures that do not require infiltration. 
(Ord. No. 4-2011, § 303, 3-24-11) 
Sec. 3041. - Rate controls 
A.  Areas not covered by a Stormwater Management District Map contained in Appendix F.1 of the Ordinance: 
Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the 1- through 100-year, 24-hour storms. If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for 1- through 100-year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement. 
B.  Areas designated as District B-2 - Nescopeck Creek Watershed Only: 
1.  If a mine reclamation project is proposed, the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year storms. Predevelopment land cover conditions shall be considered forest in good condition. 
2.  Proposed land development projects shall apply the 60% release rate criterion for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year storms. This applies to all sites including those that have been previously reclaimed. Predevelopment land cover conditions shall be considered forest in good condition.

APPENDIX B - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERMIT APPLICATION 
Anyone performing a regulated activity must complete the accompanying Stormwater Management Permit Application, and submit to the City. A regulated activity is defined by this Ordinance as: 
Regulated Activity - Any earth disturbance activities or any activities that involve the alteration or development of land in a manner that may affect stormwater runoff. 
This includes but is not limited to: the clearing of wooded areas, grading and excavating, placement of pavement (driveways, parking areas, roads), construction of buildings and other structures (homes, sheds, garages, commercial and industrial buildings), and other activities which alter the way stormwater runs off of the landscape. Impervious area is defined by this Ordinance as: 
Impervious Surface (Impervious Area) - A surface that prevents the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, streets, sidewalks, pavements, parking lots, driveways, roofs, stone patios. See definition of "Gravel (Crushed Stone)" for when gravel classifies as impervious area. 
Gravel (Crushed Stone) - Considered to be impervious when the intended use of the stone is for transportation purposes, parking areas, construction areas, trails, or if the gravel is compacted at any time during or after its placement; landscaping stone is not considered as impervious area. 
Depending on the amount of impervious area placed and the amount of earth disturbance to the project site, this Ordinance requires different levels of stormwater management, and correspondingly different levels of design and review. 
Level 1: Proposed impervious area is less than 1,000 sq. ft. and total earth disturbance is less than 5,000 sq. ft. 
Stormwater Management Controls: Ensure that adverse downstream impacts do not occur due to redirecting stormwater flows towards nearby structures. 
Submission: Submit the Stormwater Management Permit Application and Project Sketch; the easiest mechanism is to include the application with Building Permits. 
Review: Reviewing the application will not likely require a qualified professional. 
Level 2: Proposed impervious area is between 1,000 sq. ft. and 5,000 sq. ft. or total earth disturbance is between 5,000 sq. ft. and 10,000 sq. ft. 
Stormwater Management Controls: Utilize Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA) for stormwater controls as outlined in Ordinance Appendix C.1; if DIA cannot be achieved, utilize stormwater management controls for small projects as outlined in Ordinance Appendix E. 
Submission: Submit the Stormwater Management Permit Application and computations for DIA; the worksheet in this Ordinance Appendix C.1 may be used and submitted as is, or may be modified as the City sees fit. If DIA cannot be achieved, submit computations for Stormwater Management for Small Projects; the worksheet in this Ordinance Appendix E may be used and submitted as is, or may be modified as the City sees fit; the easiest mechanism is to include the application with Building Permits. 
Review: Reviewing the application and computations may require a qualified professional if the person responsible for issuing Building Permits is not comfortable with performing the review. 
Level 3: Proposed impervious area is between 5,000 sq. ft. and 10,000 sq. ft. or total earth disturbance is between 10,000 sq. ft. and 20,000 sq. ft. 
Stormwater Management Controls: Capture and permanently remove the first 2 inches of runoff over all proposed impervious areas; infiltrate at least the first 0.5 inches. 
Submission: Submit the Stormwater Management Permit Application and computations for permanently removing the first 2 inches of runoff over all proposed impervious areas; the worksheet in this Ordinance Appendix D may be used and submitted as is, or may be modified as the City sees fit. 
Review: Reviewing the application and computations will most likely require a qualified professional. 
Level 4: Proposed impervious area is greater than 10,000 sq. ft. or total earth disturbance is greater than 20,000 sq. ft. 
Stormwater Management Controls: All requirements of this Ordinance are applicable, including water quality and volume controls as found in Article III Section 303 and peak rate controls as found in Article III Section 304. 
Submission: Submit the Stormwater Management Permit Application and Stormwater Management (SWM) Site Plan as in Article IV of this Ordinance. 
Review: Reviewing the application and SWM Site Plan requires a qualified professional. 
Following the Stormwater Management Permit Application and accompanying sketch sheet are examples of common smaller projects which do not require the review by a qualified professional (review by a qualified professional is optional). An Alternative Stormwater Management Permit Application is also provided following the examples. Both forms may be modified by the City before one is selected.

APPENDIX C.1 - DISCONNECTED IMPERVIOUS AREA (DIA) AND WORKSHEET 
When a regulated activity creates impervious areas between 1,000 sq. ft. and 5,000 sq. ft., or total earth disturbance between 5,000 and 10,000 sq. ft., the stormwater management requirements follow Appendix C.1 - Disconnected Impervious Areas (DIAs), of this Ordinance. If site conditions prevent the requirements of Appendix C.1 from being met, then the first 1 inch of runoff shall be captured and controlled in a manner consistent with Appendix E - Stormwater Management for Small Projects, of this Ordinance. 
When rooftop or pavement runoff is directed to a pervious area that allows for infiltration, filtration, and increased time of concentration, the contributing rooftop or pavement area-may qualify as a Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA). A rooftop or pavement area is considered to be a DIA if it meets the requirements listed below: 
 The soil, in proximity of the discharge area, is not designated as hydrologic soil group "D" or equivalent (see Appendix F.2. Hydrologic Soil Group Map); 
 The overland flow path (pervious area serving as BMP) from discharge area has a positive slope of 10% or less; 
 The length of overland flow path (pervious area serving as BMP) is greater than or equal to the contributing rooftop or pavement length; 
 The length of overland flow path (pervious area serving as BMP) is greater than 25 feet. 
If the discharge is concentrated at one or more discrete points, no more than 1,000 square feet of impervious area may discharge to any one point. In addition, a gravel strip or other spreading device is required for concentrated discharges. For non-concentrated discharges along the edge of the pavement, this requirement is waived; however, there must be a provision for the establishment of vegetation along the pavement edge and temporary stabilization of the area until vegetation becomes stabilized. 
If rainspouts are discharged underground to provide infiltration, the portion of the impervious area draining to those rainspouts is waived from the DIA discharge requirements. Rainspouts discharged underground which are directly connected to a storm sewer system are not waived from the DIA requirements. 
Computations for DIA as a BMP must be submitted to the municipality. This worksheet is provided as an example, or may be used for the computations.

APPENDIX C.2 - RAINSPOUT DISCONNECTION FROM SANITARY SEWER SYSTEMS REQUIREMENT FOR MUNICIPALITIES 
When roofs are being replaced, rainspouts must be disconnected from sanitary sewer systems, The following guidance is provided to enforce this requirement as part of this Ordinance, and is subject to the municipal engineer's discretion. When rainspouts are disconnected from sanitary sewer systems, it must be shown that adverse stormwater impacts are not created downstream. 


APPENDIX D - PROJECTS MEETING REQUIREMENTS IN SECTION 303 SUBSECTION B 
When a regulated activity creates impervious areas between 5,000 sq. ft. and 10,000 sq. ft., or total earth disturbance between 10,000 and 20,000 sq. ft., the stormwater management requirements follow Section 303 Subsection B of this Ordinance. 
Section 303 Subsection B is duplicated below: 
B.  When CG-1 guidelines are not used, the Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual 1 ) has been modified to accommodate 2" of permanently removed runoff volume. This method (provided below) is independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. For new impervious surfaces: 
1.  The first 2 inches of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow (i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth), Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. 
2.  Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated. 
3.  Facilities, to the greatest extent possible and subject to the Municipal Engineer's discretion, shall be designed to drain the permanently removed runoff volume in a period no less than 24 hours and no greater than 72 hours. 
4.  Runoff volume in excess of 2 inches shall be safely conveyed to existing stormwater collection systems or streams, in the direction of the existing drainage course. 
5.  This method is exempt from the requirements of Section 304, Rate Controls. 
Computations for all stormwater facilities must be submitted to the municipality. This worksheet is provided as an example, or may be used for the computations.

APPENDIX E - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR SMALL PROJECTS 
Applicability: Stormwater management procedures for projects between 1,000 sq. ft. and 5,000 sq. ft. of proposed impervious area or total earth disturbance between 5,000 sq. ft. and 10,000 sq. ft. for which site conditions prevent the use of Ordinance Appendix C.1 - Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA) as a BMP. 
Note: This small projects document is not to be used to plan for multiple lots without obtaining prior written approval from the City. Approvals and actions associated with this document do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law or ordinance. 
E.1 Introduction 
These methods have been developed to allow homeowners to comply with stormwater management criteria for new projects to meet the requirements of the Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance of the City including sizing, designing, locating, and installing on-lot measures, referred to herein as "Best Management Practices" (BMPs). Pennsylvania Act 167 was authorized on October 4, 1978 (32 P.S., P.L. 864) and gave Pennsylvania municipalities the power to regulate activities that affect stormwater runoff and surface and groundwater quantity and quality. 
Individual home construction projects on single-family lots which result in 1,000 sq. ft. to 5,000 sq. ft. of proposed impervious area (including the building footprint, driveway, sidewalks, and parking areas) are not required to submit formal stormwater management (SWM) site plans to the City or County; however, they must address water quality and infiltration goals, and submit the worksheet as outlined in this small projects document. If the guidelines presented in this brochure are followed, the individual homeowner will not require professional services to comply with these water quality and infiltration goals. 
Section E.2 presents options of BMPs that can be considered for on-lot stormwater management, Section E.3 describes requirements and outlines the method for designing a suitable BMP, and a description of what needs to be included on the simple sketch plan, and the Small Projects Worksheet in Table E.4, Section E.4 contains an example of how to obtain the size and dimensions of the BMPs, complete the site sketch, and prepare the Small Project Worksheet. 
The stormwater management method for small projects requires: 
 The first 1" of rainfall runoff from proposed impervious surfaces to be captured (see definition of captured in Article II of the Ordinance). 
The purpose of this small projects document is to help reduce stormwater runoff in the community, to maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water resources and public safety. 
What needs to be sent to the City? 
Stormwater computations and a sketch plan must be submitted to the City. The small projects worksheet found in Table E.4 and a simple sketch plan containing the features described in Step 5 of Section E.3 is provided as an example, or may be used for submission to the City, and if applicable, the contractor prior to construction. 
E.2 Description of BMPs 
The following is a description of several types of BMPs that could be implemented. Refer to Chapter 6 of the PA BMP Manual which can be found on the PA Department of Environmental Protection's website for specifications and steps for construction for the following BMPs, A list of routine maintenance for each of the BMPs described below is also included at the end of this section. 
Rain Barrels/Cisterns 
 Rain barrels and cisterns are large containers that collect drainage from roof leaders and temporarily store water to be released to lawns, gardens, and other landscaped areas; rain barrels are typically less than 50 gallons in size, and cisterns typically have volumes of up to 1,000 gallons or more, and can be placed on the surface or underground. 


Rain Garden/Bioretention Area 
 A rain garden/bioretention area is an excavated depression area on the surface of the land in which native vegetation is planted to filter and use stormwater runoff; depths of 1.0 foot or less are recommended. Planting species should be native to Pennsylvania.

Dry Wells 
 A dry well, also referred to as a seepage pit is a subsurface storage facility that temporarily stores and infiltrates runoff from the roofs of buildings or other impervious surfaces; recommended depth of dry well is between 1.0 and 4.0 feet. 
 Dry Well #1 - structural prefabricated chamber; no stone fill. 
 Dry Well #2 - excavated pit filled with stone fill. 


Infiltration Trench 
 An infiltration trench is a long, narrow, rock-filled trench with or without a perforated pipe that receives stormwater runoff and has no outlet. 
 Runoff is stored in the void space between the stones and in the pipe and infiltrates through the bottom and into the underlying soil matrix. 
 The width is limited to between 3 and 8 feet, and the depth ranges from 2 to 5 feet. 

Routine Maintenance for BMPs 
 Vegetation along the surface of an infiltration trench should be maintained in good condition, and any bare spots should be revegetated as soon as possible. 
 Vehicles shouldn't be parked or driven on an infiltration trench, and care should be taken to avoid excessive compaction by mowers. 
 Any debris such as leaves blocking flow from reaching an infiltration trench or bioretention/rain garden should be routinely removed. 
 While vegetation is being established, pruning and weeding may be required for a bioretention/rain garden. 
 Mulch in a bioretention/rain garden needs to be re-spread when erosion is evident. Once every two to three years or after major storms the entire area may require mulch replacement. 
 At least twice a year the landowner needs to inspect the bioretention/rain garden for sediment buildup and vegetative conditions. 
 During periods of extended drought, the bioretention/rain garden requires watering. 
 Trees and shrubs in a bioretention/rain garden need to be inspected at least twice per year by the landowner to evaluate their health. If they are in poor health, they need to be replaced. 
 Dry wells need to be inspected by the landowner at least four times a year and after significant rainfalls, and debris/trash, sediment, and any other waste material need to be removed and disposed of at suitable disposal/recycling sites and in compliance with local, state, and federal waste regulations. 
 For dry wells, gutters need to be regularly cleaned out, and proper connections must be maintained to facilitate the effectiveness of the dry well. 
 The filter screen for the dry well that intercepts roof runoff must be replaced as necessary. 
 Dry wells that are damaged need to be fixed or replaced immediately. 
 If an intermediate sump box exists in conjunction with a dry well, it must be cleaned out at least once per year. 
 Rain barrels and cisterns need to be cleared of debris routinely at least every three months and after significant storms to allow stormwater from gutters to enter them. 
 Gutters that directly convey rain water to dry wells, rain barrels, and cisterns need to be routinely cleared of trash and debris at least every three months and after significant storms. 
 Rain barrels and cisterns must be kept covered. 
 Rain barrels and cisterns should be routinely emptied so that they are only 1/4 of the way full to allow for storage of additional rainwater. 
 Overflow outlets from rain barrels and cisterns must be kept free and clear of debris. 
 Rain barrels and cisterns that are damaged need to be fixed or replaced immediately. 
E.3. Determination of BMPs and Volume Requirements 
All proposed impervious areas must be included in the determination of the amount of new impervious areas and the size of proposed BMPs needed to control stormwater. 
Proposed impervious areas on an individual residential lot include: 
 Roof area 
 Pavement 
 Sidewalks 
 Driveways 
 Patios 
 Porches 
 Permanent pools 
 Parking areas 
Sidewalks, driveways, or patios that are constructed with gravel or pervious pavers that will not be converted to an impervious surface in the future need not be included in this calculation. Therefore, the amount of proposed impervious area can be reduced for proposed driveways, patios, and sidewalks through the use of gravel, pervious pavement, and turf pavers. All proposed impervious areas must be constructed so that runoff is conveyed to a BMP; no runoff can be directed to storm sewers, inlets, or other impervious areas (i.e., street). 
All new construction should incorporate design techniques that include: minimizing the amount of land disturbance, reducing impervious cover, disconnecting gutters and directing runoff to vegetated areas to infiltrate, and redirecting the flow of runoff from impervious driveways to vegetated areas instead of to the street or gutter. 
Below are the steps that must be undertaken to meet the Ordinance requirements. The results obtained for each step must be included in the Small Projects Worksheet found in Table E-4: 
STEP 1 - Determine the total area of all proposed impervious surfaces (square feet) that will need to drain to one or more BMPs. 
STEP 2 - Determine locations where BMPs need to be placed, and the contributing impervious area "I" (square feet) to each. 
STEP 3 - Select the BMPs to be used and determine the requirements of each from Section E.3. 
STEP 4 - Obtain the required storage volume "V" (cubic feet) and surface area "A" (square feet) needed for each of the proposed BMPs from the appropriate heading below. 
Note: all calculations are based on 1 inch of rainfall. 
For Rain Barrels/Cisterns 
 The typical volume of a rain barrel is less than 50 gallons; if a greater volume is required, more than one rain barrel will be needed or a cistern may be used. 
 For calculations, assume the rain barrel is already 25% full. 
 Calculate volume in Cubic Feet: 
V cf = (1 inch x 1/12 x I) / 0.75 
 Convert to Gallons: 
V gal = V cf x 7.48 
For Rain Gardens/Bioretention or Dry Well #1: 
 Rain gardens and bioretention areas are only used for depths less than or equal to 1.0 feet; a dry well #1 is used for depths between 1.0 and 4.0 feet. 
 Select the depth "D" (feet) for the facility. 
 For calculations, assume the facility is empty (0% full). 
 Calculate volume in Cubic Feet: 
V cf = (1 inch x 1/12 x I) 
 Calculate surface area of the facility in Square Feet: 
A sf = V cf / D 
For Dry Well #2 or Infiltration Trench: 
 A dry well #2 is used for depths between 1.5 feet and 4.0 feet; an infiltration trench is used for depths between 2.0 and 5.0 feet. 
 Select the depth "D" (feet) for the facility. 
 For calculations, assume the void ratio of the stone is 40%. 
 Calculate volume in Cubic Feet: 
V cf = (1 inch x 1/12 x I) / 0.4 
 Calculate surface area of the facility in Square Feet: 
A sf = V cf / D 
 Determine the dimensions of the facility based on "A" calculated. 
STEP 5 - Sketch a simple site plan that includes: 
 Name and address of the owner of the property, and or name and address of the individual preparing the plan, along with the date of submission. 
 Location of proposed structures, driveways, or other paved areas with approximate size in square feet. 
 Location, orientation, and dimensions of all proposed BMPs. For all rain gardens/bioretention, infiltration trenches, and dry wells, the length, width, and depth must be included on the plan. For rain barrels or cisterns the volume must be included. 
 Location of any existing or proposed on-site septic system and/or potable water wells showing rough proximity to infiltration facilities. 
 Location of any existing waterbodies such as; streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, or other waters of the Commonwealth within 100 feet of the project site, and the distance to the project site and/or BMPs. It is recommended that the project or BMPs be located at least than fifty (50) feet away from a perennial or intermittent stream. If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant, easement, etc.), the existing buffer shall be maintained. 
 Location of all existing structures including buildings, driveways, and roads within fifty (50) feet of the project site. 
Fill in the small projects worksheet found in Table E.4, then submit the worksheet and the simple site sketch (or equivalent) to the City.

E.4. Example 
Joe Homeowner wants to build an 800 sq. ft. two car garage, and a 700 sq. ft. impervious driveway. Site conditions in the urban setting prevent the use of Disconnected Impervious Area (DIA) as a BMP. 
STEP 1 - Determine the total area of all proposed impervious surfaces that will need to drain to one or more BMPs. 
 Garage roof: 20 ft. x 40 ft. = 800 sq. ft. 
 Driveway: 50 ft. x 14 ft. = 700 sq. ft. 
 Total proposed impervious surface = 800 + 700 = 1,500 sq. ft. 
STEP 2 - Determine locations where BMPs need to be placed, and the contributing impervious area "I" to each. 
 Use BMP #1 to capture runoff from the garage (I 1 =800 sq. ft.) 
 Use BMP #2 to capture runoff from the driveway (I 2 = 700 sq. ft.). 
STEP 3 - Select the BMPs to be used and determine the requirements of each from Section E.3. 
 BMP #1 - rain barrel/cistern 
 BMP #2 - infiltration trench 
STEP 4 - Obtain the required storage volume "V" and surface area "A" needed for each of the proposed BMPs from the appropriate heading below. 
For Rain Barrel/Cistern (BMP #1) 
 Calculate volume in cubic feet: 
V cf = (1 inch x 1/12 x I 1 ) / 0.75 
= (1 inch x 1/12 x 800) / 0.75 
= 88.89 cubic feet 
 Convert to gallons: 
V gal = V cf x 7.48 
= 88.89 x 7.48 
= 664.8 gallons ? round up to 665 gallons 
For Infiltration Trench (BMP #2) 
 Select depth "D" for the facility of 2 feet (between 2.0 feet and 5.0 feet). 
 Calculate volume in cubic feet: 
V cf = (1 inch x 1/12 x I 2 ) / 0.4 
= (1 inch x 1/12 x 700) / 0.4 
= 145.8 cubic feet ? round up to 150 cubic feet 
 Calculate surface area of the facility in square feet: 
A sf = V cf / D 
= 150/2 
= 75 square feet 
 The driveway is 50 feet long, so using the upper 30 feet of the driveway as the length of the infiltration trench, the width of the trench = 
75 square feet / 30 feet = 2.5 feet 
 Use a 2.5 ft. wide x 30 ft. long x 2 ft. deep infiltration trench. 
STEP 5 - Prepare a simple site sketch (Figure E.7) and complete Small Projects Worksheet (Table E.4) to send to City of Hazleton Engineer's Office.
