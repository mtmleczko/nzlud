Purpose. The purpose of this Part is to protect the public safety, health
and welfare and to prevent and abate, in accordance with the procedures
and provisions of Act 200 of 2014, repeat, unwarranted service response
calls by the Township to the same property or location for nuisance calls,
as defined herein, which prevent police or public safety services being
available to other residents of the Township. It is the intent of the Township
by the adoption of this Part to impose and collect service call penalties from
the owner or occupant, or both, of property to which Township officials
must repeatedly respond for any repeat nuisance event or activity that
generates extraordinary costs to the Township. The repeat nuisance service
call penalty is intended to cover that cost over and above the cost of
providing normal law or Code enforcement services and police protection
Township-wide as well as serve as a deterrent to future nuisance calls. It is
the Township's policy that this Part be applied in such a way as to ensure
that victims of abuse and crime and individuals in an emergency are able to
contact police or emergency services without penalty.

including, but not limited to the following:

calls by a Harrison police officer, ordinance enforcement officer(s),
animal control officers and related public safety officials.
2. This Part shall apply only where police or emergency services respond

§ 402. Description and Special Requirements of Identified
Floodplain Areas. [Ord. 1968, 6/23/2014]
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
1. The identified floodplain area shall be:
A. Any areas of the Township of Harrison classified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated
September 26, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most-recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study; and
B. Any community-identified flood hazard areas.
2. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by the Township of Harrison and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
§ 401 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 402
1:115

identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
(2) AE Area Without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which
base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway has been
determined.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District Without Floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE more
than one foot at any point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection's regional
office.
C. The Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.
D. Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas where the
Township of Harrison has identified local flood hazard or ponding areas,
as delineated and adopted on a "Local Flood Hazard Map" using best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood
of record, historic high-water marks, soils or approximate study
methodologies.
§ 402 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 403
1:116
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 501, Subsection 2, for situations where FEMA
notification is required.
§ 404. Boundary Disputes. [Ord. 1968, 6/23/2014]
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Township of Harrison, and any
party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the Board.
The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 405. Jurisdictional Boundary Changes. [Ord. 1968, 6/23/2014]
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.

addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start
of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions.

create hazardous conditions, the Administrator may require, as a
condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable "Safety
Precautions" be taken as the Administrator considers advisable to avoid
the likelihood of danger. "Safety Precautions" may include, but shall not
be limited to, specifying a lesser degree of slope, construction of
additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, cribbing,
or walls.
1. Maximum slope steepness of a cut should be three horizontal to one
vertical for minimizing erosion and landslide hazard. However, a
governmental review agency, professional engineer or engineering
geologist may recognize the types of soil on the site to be graded from
the soil survey or better. Maximum slopes can then be determined as
follows:
A. Landslide: prone soils where slopes greater than 25% shall have
cut slopes no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical. Soil
survey map symbols are:
34-DE-6 34-E-2 34-F-1 65-E-2

above donate soils of low landslide probability.
2. Cut slopes which are steeper than those specified above may be allowed
under a grading permit, provided one or both of the following is
satisfied:
A. The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope steeper than the slope specified above for
recognized soil conditions on the site. A written statement, signed
and sealed by a professional engineer, stating that the steeper
slope will have sufficient stability and that risk of creating a hazard
will be slight, must be submitted to the Administrator.
B. A retaining wall or other approved support, designed by a

depending on site conditions and proposed grading.
1. No fill should be placed over trees, stumps or other material which
could create a hazard. Instead, such materials may be buried in natural
ground where no structures will be built or hazard created. Limbs can
be chipped and mixed with the topsoil.
2. All fills should be compacted to provide stability of fill material and to
prevent undesirable settlement or slippage.
3. No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper in slope
than three horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the
following conditions:
A. A written statement from a Registered Professional Engineer,
licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in
erosion control and geological sciences, certifying that he has
inspected the site and that the proposed deviation from the slope
specified above will not result in increased risk of injury to persons

§ 113. Standards for Minimizing Erosion and Sediment. [Ord. 1621,
3/21/1977, Art. 12; as amended by Ord. 1910, 7/22/2004]
In order to prevent erosion, the permittee shall be required to provide
adequate surface treatment by installing ground cover of such kind and
character as may be approved by the Administrator. In accordance with
Pennsylvania Code, Title 25, Chapter 102, Section 102.4(b), an Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan is required for any earth disturbance activity of
5,000 square feet or more. All Erosion and Sediment Control Plans shall
be in accordance with the requirements of Pennsylvania Code, Title 25,
Chapter 102, Sections 102.1 – 102.51. Prior to the issuance of a grading
permit, the applicant shall obtain the approval of the Erosion and Sediment
Control Plan by the Allegheny County Conservation District (ACCD).
or damage to adjacent property, streets, alleys, structures, or
receiving streams from erosion and sedimentation, is submitted to
and approved by the Administrator.
4. The Administrator may require that the fill be constructed with an
exposed slope less than or flatter than three horizontal to one vertical if
he finds that under the particular conditions such flatter slope is
necessary for stability and safety.
5. Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or earth,
the grading permit shall be subject to the following additional
limitations and requirements:
A. The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of time, the
said time limit to be determined by the Administrator and to be
specified on the grading permit.
B. Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill to a depth sufficient to effectively conceal all
materials, other than clean soil or earth, within the fill.
6. When the fill is other than clean soil or earth, the Administrator may
require clean soil or earth to be placed over the top and exposed
surfaces of the fill to a depth sufficient to conceal all materials at the
end of each day's operations.
A. No fill of any kind shall be placed over trees, stumps, or other
material which would create a nuisance or be susceptible to
attracting rodents, termites, or other pests.
B. No grading permit shall be issued for the filling with materials
other than clean soil or earth until a performance bond in the
amount of at least 10% more than the Administrator's estimated
cost (i.e. 110%) of adequately covering such fill with clean soil or
earth and providing erosion and sedimentation control and
drainage has been furnished to the Township. Such bond shall be in
conformance with that as set forth in § 107(2).

§ 114. Standards for Compaction of Fills and Benching. [Ord. 1621,
3/21/1977, Art. 13]
All fills shall be compacted to provide stability of material and to prevent
undesirable settlement. The fill shall be spread in a series of layers and shall
be compacted by a sheepsfoot roller or other approved method after each
layer is spread. The Administrator may require tests or other information
if, in his opinion, the conditions or materials are such that additional
information is necessary. Where fills are placed on slopes of 15% or more,
benching of the surface shall be required and indicated on the cross
sections. Fills that exceed a height of eight feet shall be provided at the toe
of the slope with a key bench at least two feet and four feet wide across the
entire length of the toe.
§ 115. Drainage. [Ord. 1621, 3/21/1977, Art. 14]
Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface waters from
damaging the cut face of an excavation or sloping surface of a fill. The
Administrator shall require drainage structures or pipes to be constructed
or installed which are necessary to prevent erosion and to satisfactorily
carry off surface waters. All drainage provisions shall be of such design
as to carry surface waters to the nearest practical location or natural
watercourse which is a safe place to deposit or receive such waters.
Culverts and bridges of proper size shall be installed where a watercourse
is to be crossed in accord with State rules, regulations and law.

drainage structures, fences, ground cover, and other protective devices as
established by permit and further, the continued use of said area shall be
contingent upon the maintenance and upkeep, satisfactory to the Township.
The Certificate of Completion therefor may, at any time, be revoked by
the Board of Commissioners, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in § 118(2, 3) if the conditions of the permit are not being observed or if
conditions exist that prejudice the health, safety and welfare of any person,
persons or property.
§ 117. General Requirements. [Ord. 1621, 3/21/1977, Art. 16]
1. The top or bottom edge of excavations and fills shall be at least three
feet from property lines or right-of-way lines of streets in order to
permit the normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the
abutting property. The top or bottom edge of excavation and fills shall
be at least 25 feet from the nearest bank of any stream or body of water.
A temporary fence not less than four feet in height and approved by the
Administrator shall be placed at the top of all cuts or fills and slopes in
excess of 1 1/2 horizontal to one vertical, prior to excavation. Upon
completion of grading a permanent fence not less than four feet in

top of all such cuts or fills and slopes. Before a grading permit is issued
a bond shall be required as provided in § 107(2) hereof, to guarantee
the protection of steep slopes.
2. The owner of a property shall be responsible to protect and clean up
affected properties of silt or debris washing from his property as a
result of the regrading of his property. The duties imposed under this
paragraph shall be in addition to those duties owed to other property
owners by law.
3. In order to prevent the denuding of the landscape, wherever
practicable, large trees and other natural features constituting
important physical, esthetic and economic assets to existing or
impending suburban development shall be preserved.
4. All grading, excavation or fill shall be performed so that no unnecessary
dust shall be raised. The Administrator may enforce reasonable dust
control regulations and may revoke any permit issued under this Part
until dust control regulations are met.
1. If, upon final inspection of an excavation or fill, it is found that the work
authorized by the grading permit has been satisfactorily completed in
accordance with the requirements of this Part, a grading certificate of
completion covering such work and stating that the work is approved,
shall be issued to the permit holder by the Administrator.
2. The Board of Commissioners shall have the power to revoke the grading
certificate of completion upon the recommendation of the
Administrator that the work covered by the permit, or that any
retaining walls, cribbing, drainage structures, fence, or other
protective devices shown on the approved plans and specifications
submitted for a permit have not been maintained in good order and
repair.
3. Before such revocation, the Administrator shall first give written notice
to the permit holder and to the owner of the property involved,
specifying the defective condition and stating that unless such defective
condition is remedied, the certificate shall be revoked. Such condition
shall be corrected within 30 days of notice to the owner to correct
same.

TENANT REGISTRATION
§ 101. Purposes. [Ord. 1820, 8/19/1991, § 1]

The Board of Commissioners finds that registration of tenants and other
nonowner occupants of real estate is necessary in order to have accurate
records of the numbers and identities of Township residents for purposes of

of the public health, safety and welfare. The Board also finds that the
Township has experienced more problems with the maintenance of
nonowner occupied properties than with owner occupied properties and
that pre-occupancy inspection for dangerous conditions promotes the
health, safety and welfare of occupants of rental units by reducing the
possibility of such occupants being exposed to dangerous conditions.

and activities of the occupants of every rental dwelling unit which
he, she or it owns in the Township, which conduct or activity takes
place at such rental dwelling unit or its premises.
C. In order to achieve those ends, every owner of a rental unit shall
regulate the conduct and activity of the occupants thereof, both
contractually and through enforcement, as more fully set forth
below.
D. This section shall not be construed as diminishing or relieving, in
any way, the responsibility of occupants or their guests for their
conduct or activity; nor shall it be construed as an assignment,
transfer, or projection over or onto any owner of any responsibility
of liability which occupants or their guests may have as a result of
their conduct or activity under any private cause of action, civil or
criminal enforcement proceeding, or criminal law; nor shall this
section be construed so as to require an owner to indemnify or
defend occupants or their guests when any such action or
proceeding is brought against the occupant based upon the
occupant's conduct or activity. Nothing herein is intended to
impose any additional civil/criminal liability upon owners other
than that which is imposed by existing law.
E. This Part 2 is not intended, nor shall its effect be, to limit any other
enforcement remedies which may be available to the Township
against an owner, occupant, or guest thereof.

occupant must be in writing. Such an agreement may be entered
into between the owner and occupant only if:
(1) The agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith and
not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the owner or
occupant; and
(2) The agreement does not diminish or affect the obligation of the
owner to other occupants in the premises.

occupant relieve any owner of any responsibility under this Part 2
or other ordinances or codes for maintenance of the premises.
6. Written Rental Agreement.

and shall be supplemented with the addendum attached hereto as

not a reoccurrence of the violation.
B. Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of violation, the owner shall
file with the Ordinance Enforcement Officer a report, on a form

forth a plan as to steps the owner will take in the future if the
violation recurs.
C. The Ordinance Enforcement Officer shall review the report and, if
adequate steps have been taken and the plan is adequate to
address the future violations, shall approve the plan. The owner
shall, on his or her initiative, enforce the plan, and failure to do so
shall be a violation of this Part 2.
D. In the event that a second violation occurs within a license year

neglect, fail or refuse to comply with any notice from the Township or
its Ordinance Enforcement Officer to correct a violation relating to
maintenance and repair of the premises under any ordinance within the
period of time stated in such notice, the Township may cause the
violation to be corrected. There shall be imposed upon the owner a
charge of the actual costs involved, plus 10% of said costs, for each time
the Township shall cause a violation to be corrected; and the owner of
the premises shall be billed after the same has been completed. Any
such bill which remains unpaid and outstanding after the time specified
therein for payment shall be grounds for the imposition of a municipal
lien upon the premises as provided by law. Such a lien may be reduced
to a judgment and enforced and collected as provided by law, together
with interest at the legal rate and court costs. The remedies provided by
this subsection are not exclusive, and the Township and its Ordinance
Enforcement Officer may invoke such other remedies available under

the peaceful enjoyment of adjacent or nearby dwellings by the persons
occupying the same.
4. Residential use. The tenant or occupant shall, unless otherwise
permitted by applicable law or ordinance, occupy or use his or her

alleged incident of disorderly practice, he or she shall complete a
disorderly practices report upon a finding that the reported
incident did, in his or her judgment, constitute "disorderly
practice" as defined herein. The information filled on said report
shall include, if possible, the identity or identities of the alleged
perpetrator(s) of the disorderly practices and all other obtainable
information, including the factual basis for the disorderly practice
requested on the prescribed form. Where the police make such
investigation, said police officer shall then submit a completed
investigative report to the Ordinance Enforcement Officer within
seven working days. In all cases, the Ordinance Enforcement
Officer shall complete the final disorderly practices report and mail

dwelling units for a period of time set by the Ordinance
Enforcement Officer and not to exceed 90 days. The owner, after

of this Part 2.

Enforcement Officer may recommend, and the Township Board of
Commissioners may impose, upon the existing or subsequent
licenses, reasonable conditions to fulfilling the purposes of this Part
2.

1:201
4. Grounds for Imposing Discipline. Any of the following may subject an
owner to discipline as provided for in this Part 2:

under this section, the owner must have received notice, in writing,
of this violation within 30 days after the Ordinance Enforcement
Officer received notice of the violation.
5. Procedure for Nonrenewal, Suspension, or Revocation of License.
A. Notification. Following a determination that grounds for
nonrenewal, suspension or revocation of a license exist, the
Ordinance Enforcement Officer shall notify the owner and manager
of the action to be taken and the reason therefor. Such notification

Part 2, with a specification of the grounds of the violation,
including a specification of any suspension, nonrenewal or
revocation of a license. The notice shall also state that, during
such nonrenewal, suspension or revocation, no person may
rent or permit occupancy of the rental dwelling units in
question. Such violations must be cured within 30 days from
§ 208 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 208
1:202
the date of the notice, unless exigent circumstances involving
an immediate threat to the public health, welfare or safety
dictate more-immediate remediation. In the case of license
suspension, nonrenewal or revocation, the notice will state the
specific timing of such suspension, nonrenewal or revocation,
including the date upon which suspension or nonrenewal will
commence, the duration of any suspension and the deadline for
commencing eviction of tenants.
(4) Notice that each day the violation remains shall be a separate
violation and punishable under § 209 of this Part. The Township
shall further have the right to enjoin the obligations and duties
created under this Part 2.
(5) Any person aggrieved by the Officer's denial, suspension,
nonrenewal or revocation of a license may appeal such denial
by submitting a written request for a Local Agency Law
hearing to the office of the Township Secretary within 20 days
from the date of mailing of the denial letter and accompanied
by a nonrefundable appeal fee of $50, the amount of such fee to
be subject to adjustment by resolution of the Board of
Commissioners.
(6) Such written request for a Local Agency Law hearing shall
state the grounds upon which the request is made. The
appellant shall be responsible for the cost of the
stenographer's appearance fee and the cost of any advertising
of such hearing. The Township Board of Commissioners may
act as the Local Agency Law appeal hearing body or may
appoint a tribunal or hearing officer to hear the appeal and to
make a recommended ruling to the Board of Commissioners.
B. Delivery of Notification.
(1) All notices shall be sent to the owner or manager, if applicable,

personal service on the owner or manager, if applicable. The
Ordinance Enforcement Officer shall also post the notice in a
conspicuous place on the premises.
(2) If personal service cannot be accomplished after a reasonable
attempt to do so, then the notice may be sent to the owner or
manager at an address stated on the most-current license
application for the premises in question, by regular first-class
mail, postage prepaid. If such notice is not returned by the
postal authorities within five days of its deposit in the United
States mail, then it shall be deemed to have been delivered to
and received by the addressee on the fifth day following its
deposit in the United States mail, and all time periods set forth

§ 210. Miscellaneous Provisions. [Ord. 1969, 6/23/2014]
under Subsection 5A above shall thereupon be calculated from
said fifth day.
1. Basis for Violation. It shall be unlawful for any person to rent to any
person a rental dwelling unit for which a license is required without a
valid, current license issued by the Township authorizing such
operation. It shall also be unlawful for any person, either owner or
manager, to allow the number of tenants or occupants of a rental
dwelling unit to exceed the maximum limit as set forth on the license, or
to violate any other provision of this Part 2. It shall be unlawful for any
tenant or occupant to violate this Part 2.
2. Penalties. Any violation of this Part 2 shall constitute a summary offense
punishable, upon conviction thereof by a Magisterial District Judge, by
a fine not to exceed $1,000 plus costs of prosecution or, in default of
payment of such fines and costs, by a term of imprisonment not to
exceed 30 days. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate and
distinct offense.
3. Nonexclusive Remedies. The penalty provisions of this Part 2 and the
license nonrenewal, suspension and revocation procedures provided in
this Part 2 shall be independent, non-mutually-exclusive, separate
remedies, all of which shall be available to the Township as may be
deemed appropriate for carrying out the purposes of this Part 2. The
remedies and procedures in this Part for violation hereof are not
intended to supplant or replace, to any degree, the remedies and
procedures available to the Township in the case of a violation of any
other code or ordinance of the Township, whether or not such other
code or ordinance is referenced in this Part 2 and whether or not an
ongoing violation of such other code or ordinance is cited as the
underlying ground for a finding of a violation of this Part 2.
1. Notices.
A. For purposes of this Part 2, any notice required hereunder to be
given to a manager shall be deemed as notice given to the owner.
B. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any notice required to
be given to the owner under this Part 2 shall have been received by
such owner if the notice was given to the owner in the manner
provided by this Part 2.
C. A claimed lack of knowledge by the owner of any violation
hereunder cited shall be no defense to license nonrenewal,
suspension or revocation proceedings as long as all notices
prerequisite to institution of such proceedings have been given and
§ 208 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 210
1:204
deemed received in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Part 2.
2. Changes in Ownership Occupancy. It shall be the duty of each owner or
manager of a rental dwelling unit to notify the Ordinance Enforcement
Officer in writing of any change in ownership of the premises or of the
number of rental dwelling units on the premises.

LICENSING OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
§ 301. Purpose and Findings. [Ord. 1858, 9/23/1996, § 301]
1. Purpose.
A. Pursuant to the authority granted in the First Class Township Code
to prohibit nuisances; to promote the health, cleanliness, comfort
and safety of the citizens of Harrison Township; to define and
prohibit disorderly practices; to regulate buildings and to regulate
the time of opening and closing, and the conduct of places of public
entertainment, amusement and recreation, the Township of
Harrison enacts this Part to minimize and control the adverse
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby
protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens; protect the
citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve
the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods;
and deter the spread of blight.
B. The Board of Commissioners has determined that locational
criteria alone does not adequately protect the health, safety and
general welfare of the prople of the Township, and that licensing is
a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to insure that
operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable
regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
2. Legislative Findings.
A. Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects,
which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public
health, safety and welfare. These secondary effects include, but are
not limited to, the spread of communicable diseases, performance
of sexual acts in public places, presence of discarded sexually
oriented materials on public and private property, sexual
harassment, obscenity, prostitution and other illegal sexual
activities, crime and neighborhood deterioration.
B. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive
on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in
a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Township. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring
therein.
§ 301 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 301
1:215
§ 302. Definitions. [Ord. 1858, 9/23/1996, § 302]
As used in this Part the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings indicated unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
ADULT ARCADE — Any place to which the public is permitted or invited
wherein coin-operated, slug-operated, or for any form of consideration, or
electronically, electrically, or mechanically controlled still or motion picture
C. Removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient
lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in discouraging the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
D. Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incident of certain types of criminal
behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or
suspects and by preventing minors from working in such
establishments.
E. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, limiting the adverse secondary effects
of such businesses.
F. It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this Part
is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such
activity.
G. The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license
has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in
contravention of this Part.
H. The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to
and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.
I. The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the
Township will be promoted by the enactment of this Part.
J. Limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to
10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays, and closure
of such businesses on Sundays and holidays reduces the adverse
secondary effects of such businesses, including particularly, but not
limited to, late night noise levels, crime and sexually offensive
materials and activities in public areas, and promotes the public
health, safety and welfare.

1. Findings and Purpose: The Township finds that:
§ 407 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 409
1:309
A. Certain residential areas in the Township are subjected to
commuter vehicle parking, therefore depriving the residents of
those areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles;
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of
commuter traffic, which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week. Therefore, the Township considers it to be in the interest of
the people of the Township to provide for the establishment of a
residential permit parking program to ensure primary access to
available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to
provide a cleaner ambient air level.
2. Definitions: For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE — A motor vehicle parked in a residential area
by a person not a resident of that residential area.
PROPRIETOR — A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address.
For the purpose of this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one
parking permit for that business or professional office address.
RESIDENT — A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence or bona
fide occupancy, or both, at that address.
RESIDENTIAL AREA — A contiguous area containing public highways
or parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
3. Criteria. The residential areas designated in Subsection 4 of this
section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential
parking on the basis of the following criteria:
A. During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of
vehicles parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in
the area is equal to 70% or more of the legal, on-street parking
capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal
parking space shall be 20 linear feet.
B. During the same period as specified in Subsection 3A, directly
above, 10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the
streets in the area are not registered in the name of a person
residing in the area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest
§ 409 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 409
1:310
available information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and
Licensing of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used.
Provided: in determining that a specific area identified as
impacted and eligible for residential permit parking is designated
as a residential permit parking area, the following factors are
taken into consideration:
(1) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment;
(2) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Township;
(3) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking
and related health and safety hazards;
(4) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area;
(5) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs
in connection with it; and
(6) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit
parking program in proximity to establishments located in the
residential permit parking area and used by the general public
for religious, health or educational purposes.
4. Designation of Residential Permit Parking Areas. The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:

Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit
parking area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions
under which parking shall be by permit only.
5. Application for Permit. Application for a residential parking permit shall
be made to the Township Secretary by the person desiring the permit,
who shall be only the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle who resides
on or is a proprietor of property immediately adjacent to a street or
other location within a residential parking permit area. A separate
application shall be required for each motor vehicle. Each application
shall contain the following information: the name of the owner or the
driver, as the case may be, of the motor vehicle; the address of the
resident or the proprietor, as the case may be; the make, model and
registration number of the motor vehicle; and the driver number as
§ 409 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 409
1:312
taken from the applicant's current driver's license. At the discretion of
the Township Secretary, the applicant shall be required, at the time of
making application, to present his/her driver's license and the vehicle
registration card.
6. Issuance of Permit. Upon receipt of the application and a determination
that the information upon the application shows that the applicant is
entitled to a residential parking permit, the Township Secretary shall
issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall be valid
for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display the
serial and registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential
parking area number, and the expiration date. The permit shall be
renewable annually before the expiration date, upon making
application for renewal. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this
section for any person to display other than the current and valid
permit while standing or parking in a residential permit parking area at
any time when those permits are to be displayed.
7. Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits
(two per household) may be issued by the Township Secretary to bona
fide visitors of residents of a designated residential permit parking
area, and exemption parking permits may be issued, without payment
of a fee, to handicapped persons.
8. Responsibility of Permit Holder:
A. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or
park a motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential
parking area during those times when parking of motor vehicles is
permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a residential
parking permit has been issued is so parked, that permit shall be
displayed so as to be clearly visible through the windshield of the
vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve
to the holder a parking space within a designated residential
permit parking area.
B. A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand
or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when
stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set
aside for other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit
exempt its holder from the observance of any traffic or parking
regulation other than residential permit parking regulation or
restriction.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a
vehicle operated; any such use or display by a person other than
the permit holder shall constitute a violation of this section by the
permit holder and by the person who so used or displayed the
parking permit.
§ 409 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 409
1:313
§ 410. Penalties. [Ord. 1782, 2/16/1987]
Any person who violates any provision of this Part shall, upon conviction,
be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $15 and costs; provided, it
shall be the duty of the police officers and of parking enforcement personnel
of the Township to report to the appropriate official all violations of any
provision of this Part, indicating, in each case: the section violated; the
license number of the vehicle involved in the violation; the location where
the violation took place; and any other facts that might be necessary in
order to secure a clear understanding of the circumstances attending the
violation. The police officer or other person making the report shall also
attach to or place upon every such vehicle a notice stating that the vehicle
was parked in violation of this Part. The notice shall contain instructions
to the owner or driver of the vehicle to report to the office of the Chief of
Police and pay the fine so indicated within the allotted time to avoid further
prosecution.
D. It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person falsely to
represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information in an application to the Township
Secretary in order to obtain a residential parking permit.
(1) Revocation of Permits. The Township Secretary shall have
authority to revoke the residential parking permit of any
permit holder found to be in violation of any provision of this
section. Upon written notification to him of the revocation, the
permit holder shall surrender the permit to the Township
Secretary. Failure to do so, when so requested, shall constitute
a violation of this section; provided, any person receiving such
a notice may, within 10 days after the date of the notice, appeal
to the Board of Commissioners for a hearing on the revocation,
and the decision of the Board of Commissioners shall be final.

only by "approved storage garages" that shall be designated from time
to time by the Board of Commissioners. Every such garage shall submit
evidence to the Board of Commissioners that it is bonded or has acquired
liability insurance in an amount satisfactory to the Board of Commissioners
as sufficient to indemnify owners of impounded vehicles against loss or
damage to those vehicles while in the custody of the garage keeper for the

1987]
The payment of towing and storage charges shall not relieve the owner or
driver of any vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation
of the provision of this chapter for which the vehicle was removed or
impounded.
§ 506. Reclamation Costs. [Ord. 1782, 2/16/1987]

Part 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 101. Short Title. [Ord. No. 2001, 11/19/201830]
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Township of Harrison
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 102. Statement of Findings. [Ord. No. 2001, 11/19/2018]
§ 103. Purpose. [Ord. No. 2001, 11/19/2018]
1. The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater
resulting from development throughout a watershed increases
runoff volumes, flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and
storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry
and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and
flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and
increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and supports the base
flow of streams.
D. The use of green infrastructure (GI) and low-impact development
(LID) are intended to address the root cause of water quality
impairment by using systems and practices which use or mimic
natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and recharge; 2) evapotranspire;
and/or 3) harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth.
Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of predevelopment hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities
are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program.

Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
1. The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare
within the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and
maximizing the benefits described in § 17-102 of this chapter, through
provisions designed to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 93 to protect, maintain,
reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters
of this commonwealth.
B. Preserve natural drainage systems.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff
volumes and mimic predevelopment hydrology.

Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No
action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the municipality

cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the municipality
may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than
those in this chapter, subject to § 17-110, Subsection 2. The proposed
area of disturbance shall be less than one acre. The request for a
modification or waiver shall originate with the landowner, shall be in
writing, and shall accompany the stormwater management site plan
submitted to the municipality. The request shall provide the facts on
which the request is based, the provisions of the chapter involved, and
the proposed modification. The designated plan reviewer shall review
the request to determine if it meets the requirements of the chapter
including Subsection 2 below. If acceptable to the municipality, the
municipality may grant the waiver or modification.
2. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be
approved by the municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship
because of unique physical circumstances or conditions peculiar to the
land in question, provided that the modifications will not be contrary or
detrimental to the public interest and will achieve the intended
outcome, and that the purpose of the chapter is preserved. Hardship
must be due to such unique physical circumstances or conditions and
not to circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions
of the Stormwater Management Ordinance. Cost or financial burden
shall not be considered a hardship. Modifications shall not substantially
or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property. A request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany

CONSERVATION DISTRICT — A conservation district, as defined in Section
3(c) of the Conservation District Law [3 P.S. § 851(c)] that has the authority
under a delegation agreement executed with DEP to administer and enforce
all or a portion of the regulations promulgated under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.
DEP — The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
DESIGN STORM — The magnitude and temporal distribution of
precipitation from a storm event measured in probability of occurrence
(e.g., a five-year storm) and duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design and
evaluation of stormwater management systems. Also see "return period."
DESIGNATED PLAN REVIEWER — A Qualified professional as defined
herein, or organization such as the Allegheny County Conservation District,
that has been designated by the municipality to be the reviewer of SWM site
plans for the municipality, and shall be understood to be the reviewer where
indicated as the municipality within this chapter.
DETENTION BASIN — An impoundment designed to collect and retard
stormwater runoff by temporarily storing the runoff and releasing it at a
predetermined rate. Detention basins are designed to drain completely in
a designed period after a rainfall event, and to become dry until the next
rainfall event.
DETENTION VOLUME — The volume of runoff that is captured and
released into the waters of the commonwealth at a controlled rate.
DEVELOPMENT SITE (SITE) — See "project site."
DISTURBED AREA — An unstabilized land area where an earth disturbance
activity is occurring or has occurred.
EARTH DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY — A construction or other human activity
which disturbs the surface of the land, including, but not limited to: clearing
and grubbing; grading; excavations; embankments; road maintenance;
building construction; and the moving, depositing, stockpiling, or storing of
soil, rock, or earth materials.

natural source or delineated by applicable FEMA maps and studies as being
a special flood hazard area. Also includes areas that comprise Group 13
soils, as listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania DEP Technical Manual for
Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended or replaced from time to time by
DEP).
FLOODWAY — The channel of the watercourse and those portions of the
adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and discharge
the 100-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary of the floodway
is as indicated on maps and flood insurance studies provided by FEMA. In
an area where no FEMA maps or studies have defined the boundary of the
100-year floodway, it is assumed-absent evidence to the contrary-that the
floodway extends from the stream to 50 feet from the top of the bank of the
stream.
FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS — Planning and activities
necessary for the management of forestland. These include conducting
a timber inventory, preparation of forest management plans, silvicultural
treatment, cutting budgets, logging road design and construction, timber

GROUNDWATER RECHARGE — The replenishment of existing natural
underground water supplies from precipitation or overland flow.
HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG) — Infiltration rates of soils vary widely
and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface intake rates.
Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their
minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged
wetting. The NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the
soils in the United States and their group classification. The soils in the area
of the development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can
be obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils
become less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS32).
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA) — A surface that prevents
the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces (or areas)
shall include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor living spaces,
patios, garages, storage sheds and similar structures; and any new streets
or sidewalks. Decks, parking areas, and driveway areas are counted as
impervious areas if they directly prevent infiltration.
INFILTRATION — Movement of surface water into the soil, where it is
absorbed by plant roots, evaporated into the atmosphere, or percolated
downward to recharge groundwater.

Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.33
LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID) — Site design approaches and smallscale
stormwater management practices that promote the use of natural
systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can
be applied to new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects.
LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store
runoff close to its source. Rather than rely on costly large-scale conveyance
and treatment systems, LID addresses stormwater through a variety of
small, cost-effective landscape features located on site.

is captured and not released directly into the surface waters of this
commonwealth during or after a storm event.
RETURN PERIOD — The average interval, in years, within which a storm
event of a given magnitude can be expected to occur one time. For example,
the twenty-five-year return period rainfall would be expected to occur on
average once every 25 years; or stated in another way, the probability of a
twenty-five-year storm occurring in any one year is 0.04 (i.e., a 4% chance).

impervious areas in the total proposed development even if
development is to take place in stages.
B. For development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with this chapter.
C. For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total
impervious area on the parcel is subject to the requirements of this
chapter; except that the volume controls in § 17-303 and the peak
rate controls of § 304 do not need to be retrofitted to existing
impervious areas that are not being altered by the proposed
regulated activity.

applicant from the requirements in § 17-301, Subsections 4 through 10.
7. The municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the municipality believes may
pose a threat to public health and safety or the environment.
8. Voluntary green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) retrofit projects that
are solely intended to better manage runoff from existing development
and are not part of new development or redevelopment are exempt
from the stormwater management provisions of this chapter. This does
not exempt such projects from any other municipal, state, or federal
regulation.
1. The green infrastructure and low-impact development practices
provided in the BMP Manual45 shall be utilized for all regulated
activities wherever possible. Water volume controls shall be
implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection 1A or the
Simplified Method in Subsection 1B below. Water volume controls shall
be implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection 1A or
45.Note: See § 901, Subsection 3.
§ 302 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 303
1:348
the Simplified Method in Subsection 1B below, or alternative design
criteria as allowed by Pa. Code Title 25, Chapter 102.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual46) is
applicable as a method to any size of regulated activity. This
method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions. The
following shall be incorporated into the CG-1 method:
(1) Do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour
duration precipitation.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the
runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters
of this commonwealth. Removal options include reuse,
evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer
provides justification that the listed removal options are not
feasible, and the designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall
be detained in a facility designed for a twenty-four-to-seventytwo-
hour dewatering time in an area with a dedicated
stormwater system (not contributory to a combined sewer
system) and shall be detained in a facility designed for a
seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area contributory to a
combined sewer system before discharge to local stormwater
systems or the environment.
(3) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas
must be considered meadow in good condition.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model
for existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual47) provided below
is independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design
Storm Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to
regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects that
require design of stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious
surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the
runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters
46.Note: See § 901, Subsection 3.

§ 303 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 303
1:349
§ 304. Rate Controls. [Ord. No. 2001, 11/19/2018]
of this commonwealth. Removal options include reuse,
evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer
provides justification that the listed removal options are not
feasible, and the designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall
be detained in a facility designed for a twenty-four-hour
dewatering time in an area with a dedicated stormwater
system (not contributory to a combined sewer system) and
shall be detained in a facility designed for a seventy-two-hour
dewatering time in an area contributory to a combined sewer
system before discharge to local stormwater systems or the
environment.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 17-304, Rate
Controls.
1. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan:
A. Postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events.
This is the equivalent to a 100% release rate area when compared
to those rates shown in the maps contained in Appendix A (New
and Existing Release Rate Management Districts).48 This
predevelopment to postdevelopment control is not to be
misconstrued as the same as the "conditional direct discharge"
areas on the release rate maps. If it is shown that the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the postdevelopment analysis are less than
or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-,
fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storms, then the
requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the
applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy
the peak rate of discharge requirement. Peak flows should be
computed using the methods included in the chapter titled
"Stormwater Calculations and Methodology" of the PADEP
Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
B. There are areas of Harrison Township which are prone to flooding
during significant precipitation events. These include areas where
high-density development occurred prior to stormwater
management requirements and where there are few, if any, existing
48.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 303 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 304
1:350
§ 305. Riparian Buffers. [Ord. No. 2001, 11/19/2018]
stormwater management facilities. Other areas such as those may
be particularly sensitive to flooding due to topography, soils, and/
or inadequate existing stormwater collection and conveyance
facilities. In such areas, and as may be required by the Township
Engineer, stormwater runoff volumes and rates may be required
to be reduced below the predevelopment levels when, in the
Engineer's opinion, such reductions in runoff rates and/or volumes
are necessary or advisable to reduce the incidences and severity of
flooding.
2. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan: For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events, the
postdevelopment peak discharge rates will follow the applicable
approved release rate maps. These maps are contained in Appendix A
(New and Existing Release Rate Management Districts)49 of this
chapter. For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the
postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates for the specified design events. Peak flows should be
computed using the methods included in Chapter 8 of the PADEP
Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
1. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian buffer. The intent of this
chapter in establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve
stream water quality. The riparian buffer is intended to slow overland
flow to the stream through the presence of native grasses, trees and
shrubs, allowing infiltration/groundwater recharge; causing deposition
of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in the buffer
rather than in the stream; and reducing erosion by providing stream
bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for streams; keeping waters
cooler and reducing evaporation.
2. Except as required by Pa. Code Title 25 Chapter 102, the riparian buffer
easement shall be required for all streams (as defined in Part II) with a
contributing watershed area of greater than 10 acres. The riparian
buffer easement shall be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet from the
top of the stream bank (on each side).
3. Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Buffers.
A. No use or construction within the riparian buffer shall be permitted
that is inconsistent with the intent of the riparian buffer as
described in § 17-305, Subsection 1.
49.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 304 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 305
1:351
B. Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
C. Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
4. The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the municipality
and shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds
Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the
property located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued
private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area
required by zoning, unless otherwise specified in the municipal Zoning
Ordinance.50
5. Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing
100-year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
6. Stormwater drainage pipes shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement, but they shall cross the easement in the shortest practical
distance. Other structural stormwater management facilities are not
permitted within the riparian buffer easement.
7. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted by the municipality within riparian
buffers:
A. It is preferred that trails be designed to be permeable and for
nonmotorized use only; however, impermeable trails are permitted
provided they have adequate drainage.
B. Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
8. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
9. Underground utilities shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement; however, work shall be performed to minimize disturbance
area and removal of trees. Restoration within the riparian buffer
easement shall be with native species of trees, grasses, and other
plantings. One tree shall be planted for each tree removed and the
restoration shall be designed by a registered professional with the
requisite experience. Aboveground utilities shall only be permitted to
cross the easement perpendicular to the easement or in the shortest

including but not limited to restaurants, nursing homes, schools,
hospitals or other connections which discharge or have the potential of
discharge quantities of grease to the Township sanitary sewage
facilities in excess of allowable standards. Installation of a grease
removal system shall be required when the Township determines that
such discharge could result in obstruction to flow in the sewer or
accumulations of grease that could result in obstruction to flow in the
§ 107 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 108
1:378
sewer. Grease removal systems must be installed according to the
following specifications:
A. No wastewater, other than from kitchen fixtures or food processing
equipment, shall discharge into the grease removal system unless
approved by the Harrison Township Public Works Director in
writing.
B. Any user required to install a grease removal system must install
either:
(1) An outdoor passive in-ground grease interceptor;
(2) An automatic electrical/mechanical grease removal unit; or
(3) A Semi-automatic grease removal unit.
C. An in-ground grease removal system shall have a minimum depth of
four feet and a minimum capacity of 500 gallons and shall have
sufficient capacity to provide at least a twenty-four-hour detention
period for the process flow. The minimum process flow shall be
based on 15 gallons per seat or chair per day or based on actual
water usage for existing facilities, according to such reasonable
standards as may be utilized by the Township Engineer.

discharge to the grease removal device. All other dishwater
wastewater must bypass the grease removal device and be
discharged directly into the sewer system.
G. The garbage disposal units may only be installed in facilities with
properly sized and operational in-ground passive-type grease
interceptors which have been properly designed for retention of
settleable solids. Garbage disposal units are prohibited in all other
§ 108 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 108
1:379
commercial or industrial facilities. Garbage disposal waste shall
not be discharged into automatic electrical/mechanical grease
removal systems.
H. Grease and oil traps or other interceptors shall be provided at the
user's expense when such user operates an establishment
preparing, processing or serving food and/or food products. Grease
interceptors can be required in other industrial or commercial
establishments when they are necessary, in the opinion of the
Township, for proper handling of liquid waste containing oil and/or
grease in amounts in excess of 200 mg/l by weight, fat soluble, or
for any flammable waste and all such traps, tanks, chambers or
other interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Township and shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning
and inspection. All such interceptors shall be serviced and emptied
of the waste content as required for the efficient operation, but not
less often than every 30 days, in order to maintain the minimum
design capability to intercept oils and greases from the wastewater
discharged to the publicly owned sanitary sewer.
I. Waste removed from grease inceptors shall not be discharged into
the publicly owned sanitary sewer. The owner shall be responsible
for the sanitary disposal of such waste. The owner shall keep a
contemporaneous written record stating the date of disposal, the
name and address of the person or company handling such disposal
and the disposal location.

containers at least once a week and record, in a maintenance log,
the date and time of inspection, maintenance activity and the name
of the individual conducting the activity. The maintenance activities
that shall be documented in the maintenance log must include the
following:
(1) Deterioration of the oil containers.
(2) Leakage and spills from the oil containers.
(3) Properly covered storage containers.
(4) When grease was emptied and by whom.
L. A facility must maintain a proper containment around the storage
container and storage area.
§ 108 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 108
1:380
M. The facility owner is not to utilize enzymes, bacteria, chemicals,
etc., that would adversely affect the operation of the grease traps.
N. The facility owner is to document the cleaning of the exhaust
system filters and record in a maintenance log the date and time of
inspection, maintenance activity and the name of the individual
conducting the activity. No filter cleaning is to be performed in an
area not protected by a grease trap.
2. Penalties.
A. Any person or user who is found to have failed to comply with the
provisions of this Section regarding grease traps may be fined up to
$1,000 per day per violation. Each day of violation shall be a
separate offense.
B. Wherever a user has been notified of a violation of the provisions of
this Section and has not abated the violation within the deadline as
ordered by the Township, the Township may arrange with the water
supplier for water service to the user to be severed and for service
to recommence, at the user's expense, after the user has
satisfactorily come into compliance. The user shall pay all water
termination-related charges of the water supplier.
C. In addition to the penalties and remedies contained herein, the
Township may take any action at law or in equity to seek redress for
violation of this Section.
3. Appeals and Modifications.
A. Should the Township determine any user to be in violation of these
regulations, it may serve upon such person a written notice stating
the nature of the violation. Within 20 days from the date of said
notice, the user must supply to the Township a written explanation
for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction of the
violation and a schedule for coming into full compliance.
Submission of such a plan does relieve the user of liability for any
violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
B. Any person aggrieved by the issuance of a violation notice under
this Section may file a written appeal to the Township Secretary
within 20 days of such notice of violation requesting a Local Agency
Law hearing. Upon the filing of such appeal, the Board of
Commissioners will provide for such a hearing and may assign a
hearing officer to conduct a hearing, make findings of fact and
recommendations, and/or to issue a determination. Any request for
an appeal hearing shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable
hearing fee of $50, and the applicant shall be responsible for
payment of all costs incurred by the Township in connection with
the hearing, including but not limited to court reporter costs, costs
of transcripts, cost of publication of notices, etc.
§ 108 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 108
1:381
C. Upon written request from any person, the Township Engineer may
approve a modification of any substantive requirement herein,
provided that such modification is needed to avoid undue hardship,
adequate measures are taken to preserve the proper operation of
the sanitary sewer system, and the modification poses no danger to
the public health.

the Township permits and requires residents to contract with

collection can appropriately be limited to that of licensing
collectors, regulating collection and enforcing the prohibition of
dumping within the Township.

trash creates a hazard and danger to the health, safety and welfare
of the people of the Township of Harrison.

expenditures, to promote the freedom of choice, free enterprise
system and business opportunity as respects collection of garbage,
rubbish and trash in the Township and to protect the health, safety
and welfare of people of the Township by regulating such
collection.

Commissioners, officers, employees and agents harmless and to
indemnify all, or any of them, from any and all claims, damages, suits,
liabilities and costs which may arise, or be claimed to arise, by reason of
the work, either as authorized or as actually undertaken by the
permittee. The issuance of a permit, or the doing of any work provided
for by this Part, shall constitute the agreement, by the person doing the
work, to the provisions of this subsection, irrespective of whether same
is expressed elsewhere.
1. No excavation in any roadway shall extend beyond the center line of
such roadway until the surface of the initial excavation is restored to a
condition which shall provide safe and convenient access for pedestrian
and vehicular traffic. At no time will the improved part of a roadway be
completely closed to vehicular or pedestrian traffic, unless such closing
is authorized, in advance and in writing, by the Superintendent or
Engineer.
2. No more than 250 feet, measured longitudinally, of any roadway shall
be opened in any roadway until such time as the previously opened
surface of the roadway is restored to a safe and convenient condition
for vehicular or pedestrian traffic unless such opening is authorized, in
writing, by the Superintendent or Engineer.
3. No excavation shall be made, or attempted, if it shall or may interfere
with any utility lines or other underground facilities, unless the
permittee has first secured the permission of the owners of all such
facilities.
4. The permittee shall locate all underground facilities, including sanitary
sewers, storm sewers, gas lines, water lines, telephone and electrical
conduits and all other underground facilities, sufficiently in advance of
the commencement of the work in order that damage to any such
facilities be avoided, as well as to permit their relocation, if necessary.
The permittee shall also comply with all the utility notification
requirements of Acts 287 and 172.
5. If an underground facility is damaged by the permittee, such damage
shall be repaired and/or restored by the permittee, as necessary and in
accordance with the directions of the owner of the facility.
6. No monument of granite, concrete, iron, steel, brass or other lasting
material shall be removed or disturbed, or caused to be removed or
disturbed, without the permittee first obtaining permission, in writing,
from the Superintendent or Engineer to do so, in which case the

incidental to all replacements of such monuments by the Township.
§ 103 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 104
1:421
7. If a permittee shall cause any earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone or other
material to be either deposited upon or caused to roll, flow or wash onto
any roadway and there is thereby created a nuisance or a danger to the
public health and safety, the permittee shall cause all such material to
be promptly removed from the roadway. In the event any such material
is not removed within eight hours after notification to the permittee by
the Superintendent or Engineer to do so, the Township may then take
all steps necessary to accomplish such removal, the costs of the
removal to be paid to the Township by the permittee.
8. The permittee shall place all such barriers, barricades, lights, warning
flags, danger signs and other safety devices around the work area as
are reasonably necessary to protect the health and safety of the public.
All such safety requirements and precautionary measures shall be
based upon and conform, as applicable, to the requirements set forth in
Form 408, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation publication,
latest edition. The permittee shall also comply with any traffic control
plan which forms part of the permit. In the event the permittee fails to
comply with the provisions of this subsection, the Township may take
the necessary steps to compel compliance, all costs incurred Township
in so doing shall be paid to it by the permittee.
9. At all times while the work is in progress and prior to its completion, the
permittee shall maintain safe crossings for pedestrian and vehicular
traffic at all roadway intersections and, in addition, safe crossings for
pedestrians at intervals of not more than 300 feet. Two lanes of traffic
shall, where possible, be kept open at all intersections by the
installation of covering steel plates. All such steel plates shall be firmly
secured and, where appropriate, imbedded in bituminous material so as
to withstand the normal flow of traffic. If the size and character of the
excavation makes it impractical to use steel plates, the permittee shall
so advise the Superintendent or Engineer at the time the application for
the permit is filed and the work shall not commence until the
Superintendent or Engineer consents to the omission of the steel plates.
10. The permittee shall maintain vehicular access to all private driveways,
except during working hours when construction operations prohibit
such access, the owner of any driveway which is affected to be notified
of such nonaccess, by the permittee, prior to the commencement of the
specific work. The permittee shall also insure that there is free access,
at all times, to the fire hydrants in the area covered by the scope of the
work.
11. All excavated material shall be placed compactly along the side of the
trench so as to cause as little inconvenience and danger as possible to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic. When the Superintendent or Engineer
deems it necessary, in order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate a
dirt or dust nuisance, containment measures shall be taken by the
permittee to prevent the spread of excavated material into traffic lanes.
Temporary wooden plank walks shall be installed where pedestrian
traffic in the excavated area may cause inconvenience to such

of the public during the course of the work.
1. All excavations shall be backfilled with dry, compactable material in
accordance with PennDOT specifications, Form 408, latest edition, and
such material shall be thoroughly compacted by proper tamping. The
surface of the excavated area shall be restored to its original or equal
condition, unless permittee is authorized, by the Superintendent or
Engineer, to the contrary.
2. Existing pavement which is removed in the course of the work shall be
removed for a distance of at least one foot beyond the outer limits of the
subgrade that is disturbed, this in order to prevent settlement, the face
of the remaining pavement to be approximately vertical. A concrete
[saw] shall be used for all concrete pavement cuts and asphalt paving
shall be scored or otherwise cut in a straight line.
3. An applicant shall set forth, in detail on the application, all tunneling or
boring which is contemplated under a roadway.
4. In the event any work performed by a permittee is deemed
unsatisfactory, in the opinion of the Superintendent or Engineer, and if
such unsatisfactory work is not corrected in accordance with the
instruction of the Superintendent or Engineer or, if the work is not
completed within the time specified in the permit, or any extension of
time thereof, the Township may proceed to correct such unsatisfactory
work or complete any uncompleted work, all costs thereby incurred by
the Township to be billed to and promptly paid by the permittee.
5. All backfilling, as well as all other work, shall be accomplished by the
permittee with due diligence so that no roadway is obstructed to a
greater extent or for a longer period of time than is actually necessary.
If the work is not prosecuted with due diligence or, in the opinion of the
Superintendent or Engineer, it does not comply with the terms of this
Part, the permit or sound engineering practices, the Superintendent or
Engineer shall so notify the permittee and the permittee shall then be
required, within three days from his receipt of such notice, to proceed
to complete the work or correct any deficiency in the work. If the
permittee does not comply with the terms of the notice, the Township
may then proceed against the permittee and the surety on his bond. In

as well as all claims for property damage, any of which may arise out of its
performance of the work. This insurance shall include completed operations
and underground coverages and it shall name the Township as an additional
insured. The Superintendent or Engineer may require increased limits in

the permittee with the provisions of this Part and the permit.
7. Should settlement of a restored area of the work occur within a period
of two years from the date of completion of the permanent restoration
by the permittee, such settlement shall be considered conclusive
evidence of defective work, and the Township may then take all action
necessary to correct the condition, the cost of corrective action to be
paid by the permittee. [Amended by Ord. 1970, 7/24/2014]
8. The Township shall not, in any way, be responsible for any part of the
work which is either omitted or improperly done by the permittee, and
no officer or employee of the Township is authorized to assume any
jurisdiction of or responsibility for such part of the work, except when
same becomes necessary in the exercise of the police power of the
Township in order to protect the public health and safety.
9. If, in the judgment of the Superintendent or Engineer, traffic conditions
or the public health, safety or convenience require that any part of the
work be performed as emergency work, the Superintendent shall have
the authority to require that the permittee provide sufficient labor,
material and facilities on a twenty-four-hour basis to complete that part
of the work as soon as possible.
1. Requirements. Each applicant shall provide the Township, prior to

shall any such bond be in an amount less than $1,000. All such bonds
shall have, as collateral thereto, either a cashier's check payable to
the Township or a corporate surety acceptable to the Township. The
Superintendent or Engineer may, in the event that multiple permits are
to be issued to the same permittee, permit the applicant to furnish one
bond which shall be in such amount and subject to such terms as the
Superintendent or Engineer deems necessary to cover all the work to
be done by the applicant under all such permits. [Amended by Ord.
1970, 7/24/2014]
2. Default. In the event the Superintendent or Engineer determines that
there has been a default in the performance of the work it shall give
written notice of the default to the permittee and its corporate surety, if
any, on the bond. The notice shall state the action which is to be taken
to correct the default, the estimated cost of correction and the time
deemed reasonably necessary for its completion.
3. Correction of Default. In the event that, after receipt of the notice of
default, the default shall not be promptly corrected by the permittee
then, in the case of a corporate surety, the surety shall be required,
within the time specified, to either cause the required corrections be
made or, in the alternative, pay over to the Township a sum equal to the
estimated cost determined by the Superintendent or Engineer for the
making of the corrections. Upon receipt of such funds, the
Superintendent or Engineer shall then proceed to have the work
completed; however, no liability shall be incurred by the Township as a
result of any such action taken by it, other than its responsibility to see
to the proper expenditure of any funds so received by it.
4. Forfeiture of Cash Bond. Should the permittee have posted a cashier's
check, as collateral to the bond, the Township shall have the right,
either following or in the course of its completion of the work, to use
such portion of the funds represented by said check as are necessary to
pay all costs and expenses incurred by it, any part of such funds
remaining thereafter to be returned to the permittee.

the Township with a copy of any permit which prohibits or restricts the
flow of traffic on any roadway and the permittee shall be responsible for
coordination between itself and the police and fire departments in order
that the public safety be protected during the course of the work.

Any person, partnership, firm, corporation or any other entity which shall
violate any provision of this Part shall, upon conviction thereof, be

§ 106. Modifications. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 106; as amended by
Ord. 1867, 3/24/1997, § 1]

2. Conflict with Public and Private Provisions.
A. Public Provisions. Where any provision of this Chapter imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of
this Chapter or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or
impose higher standards shall control.

easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction;
provided, that where the provisions of this Chapter are more
restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such
easement, covenant or other private agreement or restriction, the
requirements of this Chapter shall govern. Where the provisions of
the easement, covenant or private agreement or restriction impose
duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards than
the requirements of these regulations, or the determinations of the
Planning Commission and/or Board of Commissioners in approving
a subdivision or in enforcing this Chapter, and such private
provisions are not inconsistent with this Chapter or determinations
thereunder, then such private provisions shall be operative and
supplemental to these regulations and determinations made
thereunder.
1. The Planning Commission may grant a modification of the requirements
of one or more provisions of this Chapter if the literal enforcement will
exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining71 to the

appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The
description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other
documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not
exempt the seller or transferror from such penalties or from the
remedies herein provided.
2. The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has

permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:

civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, pay a
judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result thereof.
No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the
date of the determination of a violation by the district justice. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township
may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the district justice, determining that there
has been a violation, further determines that there was a good faith
basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this Chapter
to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event, there
shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the district
justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.
2. The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay,
upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending the final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.

Part 5
GENERAL DESIGN PROCEDURES
§ 501. Application. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 501]
The following principles, standards and requirements will be applied by
the Board of Commissioners and Planning Commission to evaluating plans
for proposed subdivisions or land developments. The standards and
requirements outlined herein shall be considered minimum standards and
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety morals and
general welfare. Where literal compliance with the standards herein
specified is clearly impractical, the Board of Commissioners may modify
or adjust the standards to permit reasonable utilization of property while
securing substantial conformance with the objectives of this Chapter.
§ 502. Land Requirements. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 502]
§ 503. Street System. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 503]
1. Land shall be suited to the purposes for which it is to be subdivided or
developed.
2. Land which is unsuitable for development because of hazards to life,
safety, health or property shall not be subdivided or developed until
such hazards have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards
against such hazards are provided for in the subdivision or land
development plan. Land included as having unsuitable characteristics
would be the following:
A. Land subject to flooding or which has a high ground water table.
B. Land which, if developed, will create or aggravate a flooding
condition upon other land.
C. Land subject to subsidence.
D. Land subject to underground fires.
E. Land containing significant areas of slopes greater than 10%.
F. Land which, because of topography or means of access, is
considered hazardous by the Board of Commissioners, based on
review and report of the Township Engineer or other experts.
G. Land which is subject to ground pollution or contamination.
3. Proposed subdivisions or land developments shall be coordinated with
existing nearby neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may
develop harmoniously.
4. Proposed land uses shall conform to the Township Zoning Ordinance
[Chapter 27].
§ 501 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 503
1:471
1. Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or parts
thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted by the Township
and shall be coordinated with existing or proposed streets in adjoining
subdivisions or land developments.
2. Proposed streets shall further conform to such County and State road
and highway plans as have been prepared, adopted or filed as
prescribed by law and to Township ordinances.
3. Streets shall be related to the topography so as to produce usable lots
and acceptable grades.
4. Access shall be given to all lots and portions of the tract in the
subdivision or land development and to adjacent unsubdivided territory
unless the topography clearly indicates that such connection is not
feasible. Streets giving such access shall be improved to the limits of
the subdivision or land development and shall be improved to Township
specifications. Reserve strips and landlocked areas shall not be created.
5. Streets shall be laid out to preserve the integrity of their design. Local
access streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by through traffic
and, where possible, arterial streets shall be designed for use by
through traffic.
6. Developments with frontage on arterial streets shall not use any other
street for ingress or egress to the development.
7. Where the proposed subdivision or land development contains or is
adjacent to an existing or proposed arterial street or a highway
designated as a limited access highway by the appropriate highway
authorities, provisions shall be made for marginal access streets at a
distance acceptable for the appropriate use of the land between the
arterial street or limited access highway and the marginal access
streets. The Planning Commission may also require rear service areas,
double frontage lots or such other treatment as will provide protection
for abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections with
primary streets and separation of local and through traffic.
8. Half or partial streets will not be permitted in new subdivisions or land
developments except where essential to reasonable subdivision or
development of a tract in conformance with the other requirements and
standards of this Chapter and where, in addition, satisfactory assurance
for dedication of the remaining part of the street can be secured.
9. Wherever a tract to be subdivided or developed borders an existing half
or partial street, the entire street shall be shown on the plan.
10. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs (with adequate
turning capability) to permit future street extension into adjoining
tracts or when designed as culs-de-dac.
§ 503 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 503
1:472
§ 504. Street Design. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 504]
11. New reserve strips, including those controlling access to streets, shall
be forbidden.
12. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets
in a proposed subdivision or land development shall be made to provide
for the proper projection of streets into the unsubdivided land.
13. Street names shall be coordinated with existing or platted street names,
and if a new street is a continuation of or is aligned with an existing or
platted street, it shall bear the same name as the existing or platted
street.
14. No street shall be laid out or opened which extends to or crosses any
boundary between the Township and any other municipality except with
the specific approval of the Board of Commissioners and upon such
condition as the Board of Commissioners may impose. If the street is
proposed to serve a commercial area, an industrial area or a residential
area of 50 dwelling units or more, located in another municipality, the
street shall not be approved unless the area is also served by a street in
the other municipality and unless the relevant traffic facilities of the
Township are adequate to handle the anticipated volume.
15. All streets shall have a uniform width throughout their respective
lengths except where otherwise required by the Planning Commission
pursuant to § 504.2.
16. All streets must have appurtenant sidewalks.
1. Street Classification. Three functional classifications are hereby
established for the streets and roads in Township:
A. Arterial. This classification includes highways which provide
intracounty or intermunicipal traffic of substantial volumes where
the average trip lengths are usually five miles or greater. Generally,
these highways should accommodate operating speeds of 35 to 55
miles per hour.
B. Collector. This classification is intended to include those highways
which connect local access highways to arterial highways. They
may serve intracounty and intramunicipal traffic. They may serve
as traffic corridors connecting residential areas with industrial,
shopping and other service. They may penetrate residential areas.
Generally, these highways will accommodate operating speeds of
35 miles per hour.
C. Local Access. This classification is intended to include streets and
roads that provide direct access to abutting land and connections
to higher classes of roadways. Traffic volumes will be low and
travel distances generally short. These streets and roads should be
designed for operating speeds of 25 miles per hour or under.
§ 503 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 504
1:473
2. Right-of-Way Widths.
Type of Street Right-of-Way Width Cartway Width
Arterial 80'-120' 46'
Collector 60' 34'
Local Access 50' 30'
A. Minimum widths for each type of public street shall be as follows:
(1) Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing
public street or road having a right-of-way width less than
would be required if said street or road were created under
this Chapter, sufficient additional width for right-of-way shall
be provided and dedicated to meet the foregoing standards.
(2) Additional right-of-way and cartway widths may be required by
the Board of Commissioners to promote public safety and
convenience when special conditions require it and to provide
parking space in areas of intensive use.
3. Cul-de-sac Streets.
A. Cul-de-sac streets, whether permanent or temporary, shall be
provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a minimum
radius to the edge of the finished street or curb line of not less than
50 feet.
B. Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a property line
and a right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried
to the property line in such a way as to permit future extension of
the street into the adjoining tract. At such time as such a street is
extended, the coverage created by the turnaround outside the
boundaries of the extended street shall revert in ownership to the
property owners fronting on the cul-de-sac turnaround.
C. Commercial and industrial culs-de-sac shall be reviewed for
adequacy by the Township Engineer. His recommendations will be
given to the Planning Commission who shall have final authority in
this matter.
D. Permanent cul-de-sac streets shall be kept to a minimum and shall
not exceed 600 feet in length.
E. The minimum width of the right-of-way may be reduced to 40 feet
by the Planning Commission after review by the Planning
Commission, but only when these criteria exist:
(1) The street ends in a cul-de-sac and by reason of topography,
abutting use or otherwise, it conclusively appears that the
street will not be extended in the future.
§ 504 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 504
1:474
(2) The street is no longer than 1,000 feet.
4. Street Alignment.
A. Whenever street lines are deflected by more than 5°, connection
shall be made by horizontal curves.
B. The minimum radius at the center line for horizontal curves on
collector and arterial streets shall be 300 feet, and for local streets
the minimum radius shall be 100 feet.
C. On local access streets, the minimum tangent between reverse
curves shall be at least 100 feet; on collector and arterial streets
the minimum tangent shall be at least 250 feet.
D. Minimum vertical sight distance measured four feet above grade
shall be 300 feet for collector and arterial streets and 100 feet for
local access streets.
5. Street Grades.
A. The minimum grade on all streets shall be 0.5%.
B. The maximum grade on collector or arterial streets shall be 7% and
on local access streets 10%.
C. Vertical curves shall be used in changes of grade exceeding 1% and
shall provide proper sight distances as specified herein above.
6. Street Intersections.
A. Local streets shall not intersect with collector or arterial streets on
the same side at intervals of less than 800 feet as measured from
center line to center line.
B. The distance between center lines of streets opening onto the
opposite side of a proposed or existing street shall be not less than
150 feet unless the streets are directly opposite each other.
C. Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two
streets shall be avoided. Where this proves impossible, such
intersections shall be designed with extreme care for both
pedestrian and vehicular safety.
D. Streets shall be all laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles. Local streets shall not intersect collector or arterial streets
at an angle of less than 75°. The intersection of two local streets
shall not be at any angle of less than 60°.
E. Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets shall
be at least 20 feet; and minimum curve radius at an intersection of
a local street and a collector or arterial street shall be at least 25
feet.

1:475
§ 505. Curbs and Sidewalks. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 505]
F. There shall be provided and maintained at all intersections clear
sight triangles of 75 feet in all directions measured along the
center line from the point of intersection. Nothing which obstructs
the vision of a motorist shall be permitted in this area.
G. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. Where the grade of any street at the approach to an
intersection exceeds 7%, a leveling area shall be provided having a
grade of not greater than 4% for a distance of 25 feet measured
from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
7. Pavement Design.
A. All components of the pavement structure shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Specifications, Form 408.

1:476
§ 506. Stormwater Drainage. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 506]
1. Curbs.
A. Curbs shall be provided on all streets and parking compounds
located within multifamily and apartment building developments.
Curbs shall also be required on new streets in subdivisions or land
developments in which the average lot width of interior lots at the
required building setback line is 100 feet or less. Curbs may also be
required in any subdivision in which the lot areas or lot widths
exceed the above minimum, when the center line street grade of
any street exceeds 3%. In such cases, curbs or other drainage
controls shall be installed to properly control surface drainage and
protect the street from erosion.
B. All curbs shall be depressed at intersections to sufficient width to
accommodate wheelchairs. Depression shall be in line with
sidewalks where provided.
C. Curbs may be either the vertical type or rolled curb and gutter
type. Rolled curb and gutter shall not be used on collector streets.
The transition from one type of curb to another shall occur only at
street intersections.
D. All curbs shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete with
expansion joints every 20 feet, and shall follow PennDOT standards
where applicable.
2. Sidewalks. Minimum widths for sidewalks along each type of public
street shall be four feet, and shall follow PennDOT specifications where
applicable.
1. Lots shall be laid out and graded to provide positive drainage away
from buildings. The Planning Commission may require a grading and
drainage plan for individual lots indicating a buildable area within each
lot, complying with the setback requirements, for which positive
drainage is assured.
2. No person, corporation or other entity shall block, impede the flow of,
alter, construct any structure or deposit any material or thing or commit
any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any communal stream
or watercourse without having obtained prior approval from the
Township or the Department of Environmental Resources, whichever is
applicable.
3. Where a subdivision or land development is traversed by a natural
watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage easement or right-ofway
conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse and of
such width as will be adequate to preserve natural drainage.
§ 505 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 506
1:477
4. The Township will assure that all permanent streams, not under the
jurisdiction of other official agencies, are maintained open and free
flowing.
5. The subdivider or developer, and each person, corporation or other
entity which makes any surface changes shall be required to:
A. Collect on-site surface runoff and dispose of it to the point of
discharge into the common natural watercourse of the drainage
area.
B. Design drainage facilities to handle runoff from upstream areas,
assuming full development of those areas, based upon the
Comprehensive Plan for the Township.
C. Design, construct and/or install such drainage structures and
facilities as are necessary to prevent erosion damage to the
subdivision or land development, adjacent property and
downstream property. Such structures and facilities shall
satisfactorily convey such surface waters to the nearest practical
street, storm drain, detention pond or natural watercourse.
D. The developer shall acquire and dedicate a storm drainage
easement not less than 15 feet in width from the point of discharge
of any storm drain pipe in any street to a natural watercourse.
"Natural watercourse," as used in this subsection, is defined as a
stream usually flowing in a definite channel and discharging into
some other stream or body of water and is not intended to include
surface water conveyed from a higher to a lower level for limited
periods during the melting of snow or during or soon after the fall
of rain through hollows or ravines which at other times are dry.
(1) Unnatural drainage, drainage from nonnatural sources and
street drainage shall not be permitted in open ditches. All such
drainage shall be conducted through adequate sized pipe to a
natural watercourse as defined in Subsection D hereof.
6. Storm sewers, culverts and related installations shall be provided to
permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses, to drain all low points
along streets and to intercept stormwater runoff along streets at
intervals reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area
drained.
7. Storm sewers, as required, shall be placed in front of the curb or
curbline when located in a street right-of-way. When located in
undedicated land, they shall be placed within an easement not less than
15 feet wide, as approved by the Township Engineer, who may require
additional width of easement as circumstances warrant.
8. Street drainage will not be permitted to cross intersections or the
crown of the road.
§ 506 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 506
1:478
A. Maximum spacing of street inlets shall not exceed 600 feet.
B. All street inlets shall be PennDOT Type C or M. Inlet tops shall be
cast in place reinforced concrete or precast concrete.
C. All culvert ends shall be provided with either reinforced concrete
headwalls or pipe end sections.
D. Minimum pipe size shall be fifteen-inch diameter.
E. When material for storm drain systems is not specified, PennDOT
specifications will govern.
9. All springs and sump pump discharges shall be collected so as not to
flow in the streets.
10. Stormwater roof drains shall not discharge water directly over a
sidewalk.
11. Stabilized outlets shall be provided for footer drains, floor drains and
downspouts.
12. The soil cover complex method of the Soil Conservation Service of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture shall be used as the primary means of
estimating stormwater runoff.
13. The rational method may be used for analysis of storm sewer systems
and for stormwater management facilities in minor subdivisions.
14. Where the estimated runoff based upon the above methods is doubtful,
several recognized methods should be studied and compared.
15. The minimum design criteria shall be a ten-year storm. Higher
frequency conditions shall be used in sensitive areas and where an
overflow would endanger public or private property.
16. Runoff calculations must include complete hydrologic and hydraulic
design and analysis of all control facilities.
17. Control Facilities.
A. Permanent control measures/facilities shall be designed to assure
that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is not greater after
development than prior to development for a ten-year storm
frequency. More stringent criteria may be required in sensitive
areas where stormwater problems presently exist.
B. Control facilities shall be designed to meet, as a minimum, the
design standards and specifications of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources publication, "Erosion and
Sedimentation Pollution Control Program Manual."
(1) Detention ponds may be waived by the Board of
Commissioners on the recommendation of the Township
§ 506 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 506
1:479
§ 507. Lot Grading for Subdivisions and Land Developments. [Ord.
1851, 11/27/1995, § 507]
Engineer at sites in close proximity to the major streams. This
is to facilitate drainage prior to stream flooding.
(2) In areas underlain with limestone geology, ponds shall be
limited to the detention (dry) type unless the developer can
show a special need for a retention pond, in which case it shall
have a lining. Detention ponds shall be prohibited in areas of
known sinkholes unless the pond is lined. If a sinkhole develops
in a pond or channel before acceptance by the Township, a
lining shall be required.
(3) Any ponds with slopes steeper than three to one shall be
fenced with a six-foot fence with a type subject to the approval
of the Township.
C. A maintenance program for control facilities must be included as
part of the grading and drainage plan.
(1) Maintenance during development activities of a project shall
be the responsibility of the contractor, developer and owner.
(2) Arrangement for maintenance of permanent control facilities
after completion of development activities shall be made
before approval of final plans is given by the Planning
Commission.
In cases where permanent control facilities are owned by an
entity, it shall be the responsibility of that entity to maintain
control facilities (e.g., homeowner's association). In such
cases, a legally binding agreement between the owner and
the Township shall be made providing for maintenance of all
permanent erosion control facilities, including the inspection
by the Township.
1. Blocks and lots shall be graded to provide proper drainage away from
buildings and to prevent the collection of stormwater in pools. A
minimum of 2% slope away from structures shall be required.
2. Lot grading shall be of such design as to carry surface waters to the
nearest practical street, storm drain or natural water course. Where
drainage swales are used to deliver surface waters away from
buildings, their grade shall not be less than 1% nor more than 4%. The
swales shall be sodded, planted or lined as required. A grading and
draining plan shall be required for all subdivisions and land
developments, except minor subdivisions.
3. No final grading shall be permitted with a cut face steeper in slope than
two horizontal to one vertical except under one or more of the following
conditions:
§ 506 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 507
1:480
A. The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope of steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, and
a written statement of a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, to that effect is submitted to the Township Engineer and
approved by him. The statement shall state that the site has been
inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified
hereinbefore will not result in injury to persons or damage to
property.
B. A concrete or stone masonry wall, constructed according to sound
engineering standards for which plans are submitted to the
Township Engineer for review and approval, is provided.
4. No final grading shall be permitted which creates any exposed surface
steeper in slope than two horizontal to one vertical except under one or
more of the following conditions:
A. The fill is located so that settlement, sliding or erosion will not
result in property damage or be hazardous to adjoining property,
streets, alleys or buildings.
B. A written statement from a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, certifying that he has inspected the site and that the
proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not
endanger any property or result in property damage, is submitted
to and approved by the Township Engineer.
C. A wall is constructed to support the face of the fill.
5. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a minimum of three feet from
property or right-of-way lines of streets or alleys in order to permit the
normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting
property. All property lines, where walls or slopes are steeper than one
horizontal to one vertical and five feet or more in height, shall be
protected by a protective fence no less than three feet in height
approved by the Township Engineer.
6. All lots must be kept free of any debris or nuisances whatsoever.
7. The following regulations shall apply to all grading:
A. Definitions.
AVERAGE PERCENT SLOPE — The average slope of the area of
environmental disturbance, determined by dividing the difference
in elevation at the limits of the environmental disturbance by the
horizontal distance between the limits of the environmental
disturbance as determined by an actual field topographical survey
of the elevations within the areas of environmental disturbance.
§ 507 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 507
1:481
STEEP SLOPE — Areas where the slope is from 15 to 25% (2,596)
between adjacent contour lines (i.e., where the scaled horizontal
distance between the five-foot contour lines is between 20 feet and
33 1/3 feet) or between adjacent contour lines having an interval
of five feet or less as shown on detailed site plans prepared by a
registered engineer or surveyor based on actual field topographical
surveys.
VERY STEEP SLOPES — Areas where the slope exceeds 25%
between adjacent contour lines (i.e., where the scaled horizontal
distance between the five-foot contour lines is less than 20 feet)
or between adjacent contour lines having an interval of five feet
or less as shown on detailed site plans prepared by a registered
engineer or surveyor based on actual field topographical surveys.
B. Steep slopes and very steep slopes shall be protected as follows:
(1) Very Steep Slopes. No environmental disturbance of any kind
shall be permitted on these areas.
(2) Steep Slopes. Where any portion of the steep slope contains
soils identified by any agency of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or the United States of America as having a high
landslide-prone risk, no environmental disturbance of any kind
shall be permitted in the steep slope areas containing the highrisk
landslide prone soils.
(3) Steep Slopes. Where any portion of the steep slope contains
soils identified by any agency of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or the United States of America as having a
moderate landslide prone risk, disturbances not exceeding
25% of the steep slope areas containing the moderate-risk
landslide-prone soils may be permitted provided the applicant
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer that
such disturbances will not adversely impact the stability of the
soils.
(4) Steep Slopes. Not involving any areas identified as having
landslide-prone soils, no more than 25% of the steep slope area
may be environmentally disturbed.
(5) In instances where it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Township Engineer that no adverse environmental impacts
will occur, the determination of the percent slope may be
calculated using the "average percent slope."
(6) For projects to be developed on sites consisting of a mixture of
very steep slopes and steep slopes interspersed throughout the
project area, § 507.7.B(1) to (4) inclusive shall not apply,
provided that the developer submits, the Township Engineer
reasonably approves and the developer thereafter complies
with the recommendations contained in a geotechnical/slope

§ 508. Blocks and Lots. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 508]
stability report prepared by a professional engineer
specializing in the geotechnical field. The report shall be
deemed satisfactory in scope if it includes: a description of
the existing surface and subsurface site conditions; a review of
the site geology and geohydrology; a discussion of any slope
movements, sloughs, landslides, rock falls, or mining on or
adjacent to the site, and an evaluation of their existing and/
or potential impact on the site; a quantitative slope stability
analysis using published geotechnical methods generally
accepted by the engineering community, and verifying a
minimum slope stability factor of 1:5; profile drawing(s)
depicting all relevant parameters of the slopes that were
analyzed; a quantitative slope stability analysis using
published geotechnical methods generally accepted by the
engineering community, and verifying a minimum slope
stability factor of 1:5; a discussion of the slope stability
analysis; conclusions regarding the stability of the proposed
site grading; where appropriate, the test boring and/or test pit
logs and laboratory test results; a boring location plan; and
any other information reasonably requested by the Township
Engineer. [Added by Ord. 1920, 4/25/2005]
C. Landslide-prone soils shall be further protected, and excavations,
cuts and fills shall be regulated, as per the Township's Grading and
Excavating Ordinance [Chapter 9].
1. The length, width, shape and design of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to the provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type
proposed, to the land use and/or zoning requirements of the Township,
the topography of the land being subdivided, and the requirements for
safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
2. Unless the topography of the land being subdivided or the existing
pattern of development in the immediately adjacent area shall be
otherwise than herein required, the following minimum standards for
the design and size of blocks and lots shall prevail:
A. Blocks shall not exceed 1,600 feet in length, nor be less than 500
feet in length.
B. Residential blocks shall generally be of sufficient depth to
accommodate two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots
bordering an arterial or collector street are used, or where, due to
the contour of the land or the necessary layout of the subdivision,
there is insufficient depth between intersecting streets for such
two tier design.
C. Crosswalks or interior pedestrian walks shall be required in blocks
exceeding 1,000 feet in length to provide for pedestrian circulation
§ 507 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 508
1:483
§ 509. Development on Private Streets Discouraged. [Ord. 1851, 11/
27/1995, § 509]
or access to community facilities. Such walks shall be paved for a
width of not less than four feet, shall be located in easements not
less than 10 feet in width, and shall, insofar as possible, be located
in the center of any such block.
D. Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from the
elements of design contained in this Section if the nature of the use
requires other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for
employees and customers shall be provided along with safe and
convenient limited access to the street system. Space for off-street
loading shall also be provided with limited access to the street
system. Extension of streets, railroad access rights-of-way, and
utilities shall be provided as necessary.
E. Lot lines intersecting street lines shall be substantially at right
angles or radial to street lines.
F. Lots shall, in general, front on a street which has already been
dedicated to the Township, or which the subdivider or developer
proposes to dedicate to the Township in connection with approval
of the final plan. In commercial or industrial subdivisions or land
developments, where access is proposed to be provided by private
streets within the subdivision or land development, this
requirement may be waived by the Planning Commission.
G. The Township shall assign house numbers to each lot within a
subdivision.
H. Minimum lot sizes shall be in accordance with the Township Zoning
Ordinance [Chapter 27].
I. Remnants of land, smaller than required for a lot, shall not be
permitted within any subdivision. Such remnants shall be
incorporated in existing or proposed lots, or dedicated to public use
if acceptable to the Planning Commission.
J. Double frontage lots are prohibited except in accordance with
Subsection 2B above.
K. No residential lots shall be created which front upon an arterial or
collector street, as defined in § 504.1 herein.
1. It is the policy of this Township that all subdivided lands shall have
immediate access to a public street. Because of unique property
configuration and location, this Township recognizes the need for
limited exceptions to the foregoing general policy.
§ 508 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 509
1:484
§ 510. Open Space, Lot Siting, Planting and Beautification for
Subdivision and Land Developments. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 510]
2. No subdivision will be approved on a private street or road if more than
two lots already front on such street or road or if after subdivision more
than two lots will front on such private street or road.
1. In order to promote the highest environmental quality possible, the
degree to which the applicant of a subdivision or land development plan
has preserved existing salient natural features and land forms intrinsic
to the site, shall be assessed. Terms of approval of a plat may be subject
to the manner in which the layout or design of the plan has preserved
existing natural features, such as, but not limited to, trees, wooded
areas and water course.
2. Open Space. Where the applicant is offering for dedication, or is
required by ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or
preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a "limit of work"
which will confine excavation, earth moving procedures and other
changes to the landscape may be required to ensure preservation and
prevent despoliation of the character of the area in open space.
3. Tree Preservation. Whenever possible, trees shall not be removed
unless they are located within the proposed street right-of-way, within
the proposed building area, or within utility locations and equipment
access areas. In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level
shall be maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb the trees.
4. Topsoil Preservation. All of the topsoil from areas where cuts and fills
have been made should be stockpiled and redistributed uniformly after
grading. All areas of the site shall be stabilized by seeding or planting
on slopes of less than 10% and shall be stabilized by sodding on slopes
10% or more and planted in ground cover on slopes 20% or greater.
5. Landscaping. For all multifamily, apartment, office, commercial and
industrial subdivisions or land developments, a landscaping plan shall
be provided and shall include sufficient plantings for the required open
space, planting strips, screenings, formal gardens, shade trees and
natural barriers.
6. Buffer Planting Requirements. Buffer yard requirements should be as
specified in the Township Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27].
7. Preserved Landscaping. When there is a conscientious effort to
preserve the existing natural integrity and character of a site and where
such preservation effectuates areas of woodland and trees comparable
to required planting improvements, i.e., landscaping and buffer
screening, the plan may be received in lieu of additional landscaping
requirements.
8. Trees. The planting of trees within the street right-of-way line shall not
be permitted. The planting of any trees within the private property of

§ 511. Contribution for Recreation Purposes. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/
1995, § 511]
§ 512. Erosion and Sediment Control. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995,
§ 512]
each residential lot shall be at the discretion of the property owner or
developer.
9. Watercourse Protection. Where a subdivision or land development is
traversed by a natural watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage
easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the line of such
watercourse and of such width as will be adequate to preserve natural
drainage. Such easement shall be in addition to the open space
required in Subsection 2 above.
1. It is the policy of this Township to attempt to provide recreational
facilities for all the residents of the Township pursuant to the Township
recreation plan. Centralized facilities are preferred over local
neighborhood facilities. New and additional facilities are required in
direct proportion to increase in population. Developers causing
increases in population by new residences must share in the cost of
additional recreational facilities.
2. In accordance with § 503(11)(d) of the Municipalities Planning Code,
each developer of a subdivision or development which includes
residential dwelling units shall, as a condition precedent to final plan
approval, pay to the Township, in lieu of dedication of land suitable for
park and recreation purposes, the sum of $500 per dwelling unit.
3. The fees shall be used only for the purpose of providing park or
recreational facilities accessible to the development.
4. The fee authorized under this subsection shall, upon its receipt by the
Township, be deposited in an interest-bearing account, clearly
identifying the specific recreation facilities for which the fee was
received. Interest earned on such accounts shall become funds of that
account. Funds from such accounts shall be expended only in properly
allocable portions of the cost incurred to construct the specific
recreation facilities for which the funds were collected.
5. Upon request of any person who paid any fee under this subsection, the
Township shall refund such fee, plus interest accumulated thereon from
the date of payment, if the Township had failed to utilize the fee paid for
the purposes set forth in this Section within three years from the date
such fee was paid.
1. General Purpose.
A. The Board of Commissioners finds that the minimization of erosion
and control of sedimentation in connection with land development
and subdivision are in the public interest, affecting public health,
§ 510 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 512
1:486
safety and welfare, and therefore those regulations governing
erosion control and sedimentation control are necessary for the
Township.
B. No changes shall be made in the contour of the land, no grading,
excavating, removal or destruction to the topsoil, trees or other
vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced until such time
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been
processed with and reviewed by the Township Engineer and/or
County Soil and Water Conservation District, or there has been a
determination by the above entities that such plans are not
necessary.
C. No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless:
(1) There has been an erosion and sedimentation control plan
approved by the Planning Commission that provides for
minimizing erosion and sedimentation consistent with this
Section, and an improvement bond or other acceptable
securities are deposited with the Township in the form of an
escrow guarantee which will ensure installation and
completion of the required improvement; or,
(2) There has been a determination by the Planning Commission
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation is not
necessary.
D. Where not specified in this Chapter, measures used to control
erosion and reduce sedimentation shall as a minimum meet the
standards and specifications of the County Soil and Water
Conservation District. The Township Engineer, or other officials as
designated, shall ensure compliance with the appropriate
specifications, copies of which are available from the Soil and
Water Conservation District.
2. Performance Principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where
applicable in the control plan:
A. Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will prevent all but minor erosion.
B. Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut/fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
C. Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
D. The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
§ 512 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 512
1:487
E. Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
F. Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
G. The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
H. Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where necessary, the rate of surface water
runoff will be structurally retarded.
I. Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps or similar measures.
3. Grading for Erosion and Other Environmental Controls. In order to
provide suitable sites for building and other uses, improve surface
drainage, and control erosion, the following requirements shall be met:
A. Streets shall be improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition as one of the first items of work done on a
subdivision or development. The wearing surface shall be installed
in accordance with § 507.7 and as approved in the final plan.
B. Provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging
the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills, by
installation of temporary or permanent drainage across or above
these areas.
C. Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
D. Fills placed adjacent to watercourses shall have suitable protection
against erosion during periods of flooding.
E. During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control
will be exercised.
F. Grading equipment will not be allowed to enter into flowing
streams. Provisions will be made for the installation of temporary
or permanent culverts or bridges.
4. Responsibility.
A. Whenever sedimentation damage is caused by stripping vegetation,
grading or other development, it shall be the collective
responsibility of the land developer and subdivider, and of the
contractor, person, corporation and other entity causing such
sedimentation to remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage
§ 512 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 512
1:488
§ 513. Floodplain Area Regulations. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995, § 513]
systems and watercourses and to repair any damage at their
expense as quickly as possible.
B. Maintenance of all erosion and sedimentation control facilities
during the construction and development period is the
responsibility of the land developer or subdivider.
C. It is the responsibility of any developer or subdivider, and any
person, corporation or other entity doing any act on or across a
communal stream, watercourse or swale, or upon the floodplain or
right-of-way during the pendency of the activity, to return it to its
original or equal condition after such activity is completed.
D. The subdivider or land developer shall provide and install, at his
expense, in accordance with Township requirements, all drainage
and erosion control improvements (temporary and permanent)
shown on the erosion and sediment control plan.
5. Compliance with Regulations and Procedures.
A. The Planning Commission, in its consideration of all preliminary
plans of subdivision and land development, shall condition its
approval upon the execution of erosion and sediment control
measures as contained in Subsections 2 and 3 hereof.
B. The installation and design of the required erosion and sediment
control measures shall be in accordance with standards and
specifications of the County Soil and Conservation District.
6. Stream Channel Construction. Stream channel construction on
watersheds with drainage areas in excess of 1/2 square mile, or in those
cases where downstream hazards exist, will conform to criteria
established by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources.
1. Purpose. The specific purposes of these special provisions are:
A. To regulate the subdivision or development of land within any
designated floodplain area in order to promote the general health,
welfare and safety of the community.
B. To require that each subdivision lot in floodprone areas be provided
with a safe building site with adequate access; and that public
facilities which serve such uses be designed and installed to
preclude flood damage at the time of initial construction.
C. To prevent individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for
use because of flooding by prohibiting the improper subdivision or
development of unprotected lands within the designated floodplain
districts.
§ 512 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 513
1:489
2. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. To the extent that this Section
imposes greater requirements or more complete disclosure than any
other provisions of this Chapter, in any respect, or to the extent that the
provisions of this Section are more restrictive than such other
provisions, it shall control such other provisions of this Chapter.
3. Disclaimer of Municipal Liability. The grant of a permit or approval of a
plan for any proposed subdivision or land development to be located
within any designated floodplain area shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the Township or
by any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the
proposed use, and shall create no liability upon the Township, its
officials, employees or agents.
4. Application Procedures and Requirements.
A. Pre-Application Procedures.
(1) Prior to the preparation of any plans, it is suggested that
prospective developers consult with the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources concerning soil
suitability when on-site sewage disposal facilities are
proposed.
(2) Prospective developers shall consult the County Conservation
District representative concerning erosion and sediment
control and the effect of geologic conditions on the proposed
development. At the same time, a determination should be
made as to whether or not any flood hazards either exist or will
be created as a result of the subdivision or development.
B. Preliminary Plan Requirements. The following information shall be
required as part of the preliminary plan and shall be prepared by a
registered engineer or surveyor:
(1) Name of engineer, surveyor or other qualified person
responsible for providing the information required in this
Section.
(2) A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision or land
development with respect to any designated floodplain area,
including information on, but not limited to, the one-hundredyear
flood elevations, boundaries of the floodplain area or
areas, proposed lots and sites, fills, flood or erosion protective
facilities and areas subject to special deed restrictions.
(3) Where the subdivision or land development lies partially or
completely within any designated floodplain area, or where the
subdivision or land development borders on a floodplain area,
the preliminary plan map shall include detailed information
giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show
§ 513 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 513
1:490
contours at intervals of five feet, and shall identify accurately
the boundaries of the floodplain areas.
(4) Such other information as is required by this Chapter.
C. Final Plan Requirements. The following information shall be
required as part of the final plan and shall be prepared by a
registered engineer or surveyor:
(1) All information required for the submission of the preliminary
plan incorporating any changes requested by the Board of
Commissioners.
(2) A map showing the exact location and elevation of all proposed
buildings, structures, roads and public utilities to be
constructed within any designated floodplain area. All such
maps shall show contours at intervals of five feet within the
floodplain area and shall identify accurately the boundaries of
the floodprone areas.
(3) Submission of the final plan shall also be accompanied by all
required permits and related documentation from the
Department of Environmental Resources, and any other
Commonwealth agency or local municipality where any
alteration or relocation of a stream or watercourse is proposed.
In addition, documentation shall be submitted indicating that
all affected adjacent municipalities have been notified in
advance of the proposed alteration or relocation. The
Department of Community Affairs and the Federal Insurance
Administration shall also be notified in advance of any such
proposed activity, and proof of such notification shall be
submitted in advance of the Planning Commission meeting at
which such plan is to be considered.
5. Design Standards and Improvements in Designated Floodplain Areas.
A. General.
(1) Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances,
land located in any designated floodplain area may be platted
for development with the provision that the developer
construct all buildings and structures to preclude flood
damage in accordance with this and any other laws and
ordinances regulating such development.
(2) No subdivision or land development, or part thereof, shall be
approved if the proposed development or improvements will,
individually or collectively, increase the one-hundred-year
flood elevation more than one foot at any point.
(3) Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommodation shall not be permitted in any floodway area.
§ 513 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 513
1:491
Sites for these uses may be permitted outside the floodway
area in a floodplain area if the lowest floor (including
basement) is elevated to the regulatory flood elevation. If fill
is used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area shall
extend laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the
limits of the proposed structures and access shall meet the
requirements of Subsection 5C hereinbelow.
(4) Building sites for structures or buildings other than for
residential uses shall not be permitted in any floodway area.
Sites for such structures or buildings outside the floodway in a
floodplain area shall be protected as provided for in Subsection
5A(3) above; however, the Planning Commission may allow the
subdivision or development of areas or sites for commercial
and industrial uses at an elevation below the regulatory flood
elevation if the developer otherwise protects the area to that
height or assures that the buildings or structures will be
floodproofed to the regulatory flood elevation.
(5) If the Planning Commission determines that only a part of a
proposed plat can be safely developed, it shall limit
development to that part and shall require that development
proceed consistent with this determination.
(6) When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself
and the Planning Commission determines that additional
controls are required to insure safe development, they may
require the developer to improve appropriate deed restrictions
on the land. Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in every
deed and noted on every recorded plat.
B. Drainage Facilities.
(1) Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow
of surface waters without damage to persons or property. The
system shall insure drainage at all points along streets, and
provide positive drainage away from buildings and on-site
waste disposal sites.
(2) Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission may require a primary
underground system to accommodate frequent floods and a
secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less
frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local,
County and regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be
designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto
adjacent properties.
C. Streets and Driveways. The finished elevation of proposed streets
and driveways shall not be more than one foot below the regulatory
flood elevation. Profiles and elevations of streets and driveways to
determine compliance with this requirement and as required by
§ 513 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 513
1:492
other provisions of this Chapter shall be submitted with the final
plan. Drainage openings shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows
without unduly increasing flood heights.
D. Sewer Facilities. All sanitary sewer systems located in any
designated floodplain area, whether public or private, shall be
floodproofed up to the regulatory flood elevation.
E. Water Facilities. All water systems located in any designated
floodplain area, whether public or private, shall be floodproofed up
to the regulatory flood elevation.
F. Other Utilities and Facilities. All other public or private utilities and
facilities, including gas and electric, shall be elevated or
floodproofed up to the regulatory flood elevation.

have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this Chapter
and any walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade
trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
improvements as may be required by this Chapter have been installed
§ 607 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 612
1:497
in accordance with this Chapter. In lieu of the completion of any
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat,
including improvements or fees otherwise required by this Chapter,
the developer may deposit with the Township financial security in an
amount sufficient to cover the related drainage facilities, recreational
facilities, open space improvements or buffer or screen plantings which
may be required.
2. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the
Township shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a resolution
indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the developer
obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plat or record plan
shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial improvements
agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of contingent
agreement shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial
security agreement is not executed within 90 days unless a written
extension is granted by the Township; such extension shall not be
unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the request of
the developer.
3. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for
the purposes of this Section.
4. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the
party posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business within the
Commonwealth.
5. Such bond or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public,
the completion of any improvements which may be required on or
before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
6. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the developer. Annually, the Township may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements
which have been completed and the estimated cost for the completion
of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date
of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may
require the developer to post additional security in order to assure that
the financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection.
§ 612 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 612
1:498
7. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional
engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The
Township, upon the recommendation of the Township Engineer, may
refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or
developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate, then
the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another
professional engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and
chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or developer. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third
engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be
paid equally by the Township and the applicant or developer.
8. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year
from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by an additional 10% for each one year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one year period by using the above procedure.
9. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the
Board of Commissioners may authorize submission of final plats by
sections or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guarantees as to improvement in future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally
approved section of the development.
10. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Township to
release, or authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of
the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or
contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing
addressed to the Board of Commissioners, and the Township shall have
45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow the
Township Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Board of Commissioners,
that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been
completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon such
certification the Board of Commissioners shall authorize release by the
bonding company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by
the Township Engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed or, if the Board of Commissioners fails to act
within said 45 day period, the Board of Commissioners shall be deemed
to have approved the release of funds as requested. The Board of
Commissioners may, prior to final release at the time of completion and
§ 612 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 612
1:499
§ 613. Release From Improvement Bond. [Ord. 1851, 11/27/1995,
§ 613]
certification by its Engineer, require retention of 10% of the estimated
cost of the aforesaid improvements.
11. Where the Board of Commissioners accepts dedication of all or some of
the required improvements following completion, the Board of
Commissioners may require the posting of financial security to secure
structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of
said improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as
depicted on the final plat for a term not to exceed 18 months from the
date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial security shall be of the
same type as otherwise required in this Section with regard to
installation of such improvements, and the amount of the financial
security shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements.
12. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or municipal
authority separate and distinct from the Township, financial security to
assure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or
municipal authority and shall not be included within the financial
security as otherwise required by this Section.
13. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as
set forth in this Section, the Township shall not condition the issuance
of building, grading or other permits relating to the erection or
placement of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land
as depicted upon the final plat upon actual completion of the
improvements depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said
financial security has been provided, occupancy permits for any
building or buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the
improvement of the streets providing access to and from public roads to
such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements
as depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or
beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary
for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.
1. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify the Township, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of the completion of the aforesaid
improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Township Engineer.
The Board of Commissioners shall, within 10 days after receipt of such
notice, direct and authorize the Township Engineer to inspect all of the
aforesaid improvements. The Township Engineer shall, thereupon, file a
report in writing, with the Board of Commissioners, and shall promptly
§ 612 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 613
1:500
mail a copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail.
The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by
the Township Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Board of
Commissioners; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval
or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if
said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Township Engineer, said report shall contain a
statement of reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
2. The Board of Commissioners shall notify the developer, within 15 days
of receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered
mail, of the action of said Township with relation thereto.
3. If the Board of Commissioners or the Township Engineer fails to comply
with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements
will be deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be
released from all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or
other security agreement.
4. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or shall
be rejected by the Board of Commissioners, the developer shall proceed
to complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed. Such completion shall
satisfactorily meet the Township's statement of reasons for nonapproval
or rejection.
5. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question, by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Board of Commissioners or the
Township Engineer.
6. Where herein reference is made to the Township Engineer, he shall be
as a consultant thereto.
7. The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Township for the
reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection of
improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by resolution of
the Township and as from time to time amended. Such expense shall be
reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees
charged by the Township Engineer or consultant for work performed
for similar services in the community, but in no event shall the fees
exceed the rate or cost charged by the Engineer or consultant to the
Township when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on
applicants.
A. In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such expense
in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant
shall, within 10 working days of the date of billing, notify the
Township that such expenses are disputed as unreasonable or
unnecessary, in which case, the Township shall not delay or
disapprove a subdivision or land development application or any

§ 614. Remedies to Effect Completion of Improvements. [Ord. 1851,
11/27/1995, § 614]
In the event that improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this Chapter or in accord with the approved final
plat, the Board of Commissioners is hereby granted the power to enforce
any corporate bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If the proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient
to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by said security, the Board of Commissioners may, at
its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision
or land development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action
to recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the
improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both,
shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such

request over disputed Engineer expenses.
B. If, within 20 days from the date of billing, the Township and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Township
shall jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another professional
engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to
review the said expenses and make a determination as to the
amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
C. The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence
and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his
or her sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within
50 days of the billing date. The applicant shall be required to pay
the entire amount determined in the decision immediately.
D. In the event that the Township and applicant cannot agree upon the
professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days of the billing
date then, upon application of either party, the Court of Common
Pleas shall appoint such engineer who, in that case, shall be neither
the Township Engineer nor any professional engineer who has been
retained by, or performed services for the Township or the
applicant within the preceding five years.
E. The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the
reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if
the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or
greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in
the decision is less than the original bill by $1,000 or more, the
Township shall pay the fee of the professional engineer, but
otherwise the Township and the applicant shall each pay 1/2 of the
fee of the appointed professional engineer.

For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an
occupation with a primary place of employment within the Township during
the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such privilege for any

provisions of this Part. This tax may be used solely for the following
purposes, as the same may be allocated by the Township from time to

accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 85, Subchapter F (relating to

of the funds derived from the tax for emergency services. This tax is in
addition to all other taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the
Township. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each
calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within
which a person maybe employed.
§ 204. Exemption and Refunds. [Ord. 1933, 11/19/2007, § 4]
1. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from

that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are exempt from
payment of the tax:
A. Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which

Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the

2. Procedure to Claim Exemption.
A. A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the Township and
§ 203 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 204
1:518
with the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably
expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources
within the Township of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for
which the exemption certificate is filed. A copy of the exemption
certificate shall be provided to the Township Secretary or other
designated collector. The exemption certificate shall have attached
to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from
employment within the Township for the year prior to the fiscal
year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the
tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the Township or except as required by Subsection
2B, the employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during
the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for which
the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the
exemption certificate forms are readily available to employees at
all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the
time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be the uniform
form provided by the Township.
B. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the Township that the person has received earned
income and net profits from all sources within the Township equal
to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or
upon an employer's payment to the person of earned income within
the municipality in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in
that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the local services tax
from the person under Subsection 2C below.
C. If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection 2B above, the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection 2B, a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this Subsection, plus the per payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this Subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this Part.
D. Except as provided in Subsection 2B, it is the intent of this
Subsection that employers shall not be responsible for

investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption
eligibility or exempting any employee from the local services tax.

to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments. Refunds
made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the last day
the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of the
calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Township Secretary or other designated collector
shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt
persons.
1. Each employer within the Township, as well as those employers
situated outside the Township but who engage in business within the
Township, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax from
each of his employees engaged by him or performing for him within the
Township and making a return and payment thereof to the Township
Secretary or other designated collector. Further, each employer is
hereby authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her
employ, whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission
and whether or not all such services are performed within the
Township.
2. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection 4 of this Section. For purposes of this
Subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
3. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
4. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
§ 204 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 205
1:520
§ 206. Returns. [Ord. 1933, 11/19/2007, § 5]
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this Part, the employer shall
be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
§ 207. Dates for Determining Tax Liability and Payment. [Ord. 1933,
11/19/2007, § 6]
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Township Secretary or other designated Collector on
or before the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter of each
such tax year.
§ 208. Self-Employed Individuals. [Ord. 1933, 11/19/2007, § 7]

STREET TREES ON DESIGNATED PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTY
§ 301. Purpose. [Ord. 1982, 1/25/2016]
Trees in public places provide great environmental benefits through cooling
the air in summer, removing carbon dioxide, returning oxygen to it, and
providing wind breaks in winter. Trees also soften streetscapes and urban
landscapes, help suppress noise, and can mask overhead utility lines. Trees
also provide a haven for birds and small animals. Therefore, this Part adopts
the view that trees are a public resource to be fostered, nurtured, and
maintained, with due regard for public safety and orderly procedures. It is
the intent of this Part to promote proper selection, planting, maintenance
and preservation of trees on designated publicly owned property and rightsof-
way throughout the Township.
§ 302. Maintenance of Trees on Publicly Owned Property. [Ord.
1982, 1/25/2016]
The Harrison Township Public Works Department will maintain trees on
designated publicly owned property, including trimming and watering on a
regular as-needed basis. "Publicly owned property," for the purposes of this
Part, consists of the following property:
§ 303. Diseased and Dying Trees. [Ord. 1982, 1/25/2016]
The Harrison Township Public Works Department will cut down diseased
and dying trees on designated publicly owned property and, with approval
of the Board of Commissioners, replace them with new trees from the
Township's recommended list of trees.
§ 304. Violations. [Ord. 1982, 1/25/2016]
No person shall carry out any of the following activities on designated
publicly owned property without prior approval from the Harrison Township
Public Works Department:
1. The lot on the northern end of the Freeport Road divided roadway
owned by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation [PennDOT lot
description], adjacent to the commercial property, Donut Connection.
2. The lot on the southern end of the Freeport Road divided roadway
owned by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation [PennDOT lot
description] and across from the Township's War Memorial and
Springhill Road.
3. Such additional property as may be designated by resolution of the
Board of Commissioners for purposes of tree planting and maintenance.
1. Cut, break, prune limbs or trunks, climb with spikes, disturb or prune
the roots of, store construction materials or compact soil, or otherwise
§ 301 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 304
1:561
§ 305. Penalties. [Ord. 1982, 1/25/2016]
injure or destroy trees in any public area or authorize such actions. It
shall not be considered a violation to trim limbs or roots or perform
other activities with prior written approval from the Harrison Township
Public Works Department.
2. Cause or authorize a wire or other conductor charged with electricity to
come into contact with any tree on designated publicly owned property
in a manner that may injure or kill it, without written prior approval
from the Harrison Township Public Works Department.

activities in the vicinity of any tree on designated publicly owned
property without first placing sufficient guards or protectors as shall
prevent injury or destruction of said tree arising out of such activities.
The placement of guards or protectors shall require written prior
approval from the Harrison Township Public Works Department.
6. Place or maintain upon the ground any asphalt, cement, stone or other
material or substances in such manner as may obstruct or further
obstruct free access of air and water to the roots of any tree on
designated publicly owned property.

§ 306. Trees Planted in Street Right-of-Way. [Ord. 1982, 1/25/2016]
To ensure long-term planting success, street trees planted in the rightof-
way of any public street, lane, alley or highway within the Township
(typically in the area between the sidewalk and street curb) by private
property owners ideally should be trees locally sourced and resistant to
road salt and urban environmental conditions on the following basis:
damage or destruction occurs shall be responsible to reimburse the
Township for the following:
A. The value of the tree or trees removed shall be determined by a
certified arborist selected by the Township using a valuation
method approved by the International Society of Arboriculture; and
B. The labor cost for the repair or replacement of the tree(s) will be
either the cost of the Township subcontracting for the service or
the cost of Township personnel doing the work by the Public Works
Department.
2. This Part may be enforced by the Township Code Enforcement Officer
or his or her authorized representatives.
3. Any person who violates this Part shall be subject to a fine of up to
$1,000 per violation and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to
a term of imprisonment not to exceed 30 days. Each day of violation
shall be considered a separate offense for which a fine of up to $1,000
may be levied.
1. If power equipment is to be used for digging holes to plant trees,
Pennsylvania law requires property owners to call Pennsylvania One
Call (811 in Pennsylvania or 800-242-1716 if out-of-state) to assure
personal safety by not disturbing underground utilities. It is
recommended that property owners call Pennsylvania One Call even if
power equipment is not to be used for safety precaution in the event
there may be utility lines near the surface in the planting area.
2. Harrison Township maintains a list of street trees as recommended by
the statewide organization TreeVitalize and the Western Pennsylvania
Conservancy. There are two separate groups of recommended trees,
based on whether or not there are overhead utility lines that would limit
the mature tree height, as well as a list of prohibited trees as developed
through the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural
Resources. See the Recommended Street Tree Guidelines available at
no charge in the Township office and on the Township website. It is
recommended that property owners review the recommended list of
street trees prior to purchase and planting.
3. Property owners adjacent to street trees in the public right-of-way are
responsible for the care and maintenance of those trees.
Recommendations for care and protection of street trees are available
at no charge in the Township office and on the Township website.

Township Water Authority. The Township reserves the right to establish
the size of meter required by each customer.
4. Meters will be maintained by the Township as far as ordinary wear and
tear is concerned, but the customer, in the instance of an inside
installation, shall be responsible to the Township for any injury to, or
loss of, any meter arising out of, or caused by, the customer's
negligence or carelessness or that of his servants, employees, members
of his household or any person upon his premises under, or by, his
consent or sufferance. The customer shall not permit anyone, who is not
an agent of the Township or otherwise lawfully authorized so to do, to

and the Township agree, the meter shall be installed within the
premises supplied, at a point approved by the Township, in order to
control the entire supply. A proper place for the meter and protection
therefor shall be provided by the customer.
2. Where it is not convenient or if both the customer and the Township
agree not to place the meter within the building, as provided in the
above rule, the meter will be placed outside the building in a suitable
vault of concrete or brick, or in a meter box. The meter vault or meter
box shall be provided with a suitable cover and locking device.
3. The cover and locking device for each outside meter vault or meter box
shall conform to a proper uniform standard established by the

pressure is used, a swing check valve and a pressure relief valve must
be placed, at the expense of the customer, on the discharge side of the
meter and before any outlets are taken off the service line.
1. The quantity of water recorded by the meter shall be conclusive for
both the customer and the Township, except when the meter has been
found to be registering inaccurately or has ceased to register. In either
of such cases, the meter will be promptly repaired or replaced by the
Township, and the quantity of water consumed shall be estimated by
the average registration of the meter during previous corresponding
periods.
2. In case of a disputed bill involving the accuracy of a meter, such meter
shall be tested upon the request of the customer. If the meter so tested
is found to have an error in registration of 4% or more, the bills will be
increased or decreased accordingly.
3. Each request for the test of a meter for accuracy shall be accompanied
by a deposit governed by the size of the meter as follows: For each
meter not exceeding one inch in size, $2; for each meter not exceeding
two inches in size, $5; for larger meters, or for those so located that the
cost is out of proportion to the preceding specific amounts, the deposit
shall be $15. If the meter so tested shall be found to have an error in

permitted by law.

Words used in a special sense in this Chapter are defined in Part 6.
§ 104. Community Development Objectives. [Ord. 1944, 11/23/2009]
§ 105. Compliance. [Ord. 1944, 11/23/2009]
No structure shall be located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
converted, or enlarged, nor shall any structure or land be used or be
designed to be used, except in full compliance with all the provisions of
this Chapter and after the lawful issuance of all permits and certificates
required by this Chapter.
§ 106. Severability.
If any provision of this Chapter or the application of any provision to
particular circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of the Chapter or
the application of such provision to the other circumstances shall not be
affected.
1. The community development objectives which are the basis for the
provisions of this Chapter are set forth in the Comprehensive Plan for
Harrison Township as adopted and amended by the Township
Commissioners.
2. It is also a subset of those objectives to preserve and promote an
orderly and peaceful residential environment in the newly designated
Village District by limiting the number of taverns and bars therein, as
the Commissioners have found that:
A. In the Village environment, an increase in the concentration of
alcohol-related uses contributes to increased underage drinking,
violence and crime and to decreased residential housing
improvement and business activity; and
B. It is in the public interest and consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan to prevent undue concentration of taverns and bars in the
Village District.

The following provisions shall apply to accessory uses:
1. Continuation.
A. A nonconforming use may be continued but may not be extended,
expanded, or changed unless to a conforming use, except as
permitted by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the
following standards:
(1) The extension, expansion or new use will not cause any
condition that will be dangerous, injurious or otherwise
detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the
neighborhood;
(2) The extension, expansion or new use, if abutting a zoning
district boundary, will not be detrimental to the uses permitted
in the adjoining zoning district; and
(3) The extension, expansion or new use will not fundamentally
alter the character of the neighborhood.
B. With respect to the standards set forth above [§ 301.1A(1), (2) and

other casualty may be reconstructed and used as before if such
reconstruction is performed within 12 months of such casualty, and if
the restored structure has no greater coverage and contains no greater
cubic content than before such casualty.

otherwise, ceases, for whatever reason, for a period of one year, or is
abandoned for any period, such nonconforming use shall not be
resumed.

(b) Minimum Building Setback. No structure used for dwelling
purposes or for ancillary commercial uses shall be located
closer to any boundary of the site than 50 feet.
Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter to the contrary,
§ 309 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 309
1:612
any structure exceeding 35 feet in height shall be set back
one additional foot for every foot of height exceeding 35
feet. No accessory structure and no off-street parking shall
be located in this required setback area.
(c) Building Coverage. The total building coverage for
dwelling purposes shall not exceed 25% of the total site
area.
(d) Space Between Buildings. Every principal structure shall

in accordance with § 305 of this Chapter.
14. Open Space.
A. Common open space generated by the application of the provisions
of this Chapter shall be developed to a degree commensurate with
its location and probable usage. The common open space shall be
so dedicated or otherwise preserved and maintained so as to
always remain open and available for use by the occupants of the
development area. The land and facilities to be used for common
open space may be acceptable if either of the following conditions
are met.
(1) The land and facilities shall be dedicated for public use, with
the accepting public body agreeing to operate and maintain
the dedicated land and facilities for the originally intended use.
(2) The land and facilities shall be deeded to an organization
representing the property owners of the development. The
organization shall covenant to operate and maintain the land
and facilities for their originally intended use. The organization
§ 309 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 309
1:613
shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of the common
open space, by sale or otherwise, without guaranteeing to the
Township's satisfaction the maintenance of the common open
space and first offering to dedicate the common open space to
the public. The public body is under no obligation to accept
dedication of this common open space for public use.
B. Common Open Space and Maintenance.
(1) In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain common open space or any successor organization
shall at any time after establishment of the planned residential
development fail to maintain the common open space in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the Township may serve written notice upon
such organization or upon the residents of the planned
residential development setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand
that such deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within 30
days thereof and shall state the date and place of hearing
thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At
such hearing, the Township may modify the terms of the
original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension
of time within which they shall be corrected.
(2) If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modifications thereof shall not be corrected within said 30 days
or any extension thereof, the Township, in order to preserve
the taxable values of the properties within the space from
becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common
open space and maintain the same for a period of one year.
Said maintenance by the Township shall not constitute a taking
of said common space nor vest in the public any rights to use
the same.
(3) Before the expiration of said year, the Township shall, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofor
responsible for the maintenance of the common open space,
call a public hearing upon notice to such organization or to the
residents of the planned residential development, to be held by
the Township Commissioners or its designated agency, at
which hearing such organization or the residents of the
planned residential development shall show cause why such
maintenance by the Township shall not, at the option of the
Township, continue for a succeeding year.
(4) If the Township Commissioners or its designated agency shall
determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain
said common open space in reasonable condition, the Township
shall cease to maintain said common open space. The Township
§ 309 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 309
1:614
may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said common open
space during the next succeeding year and, subject to a similar
hearing and determination, in each year thereafter.
(5) The decision of the governing body or its designated agency
shall be subject to appeal to court in the same manner and
within the same time limitation as is provided for zoning
appeals.
(6) The cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the planned
residential development that have a right of enjoyment of the
common open space and shall become a lien on said properties.
The Township at the time of entering upon said common open
space for the purpose of maintenance shall file a notice of lien
in the office of the Prothonotary of the County upon the
properties affected by the lien within the planned residential
development.
15. Staging Development. The density of development within various
portions of the planned residential development may vary, provided that
each such area or portion of the development plan meets all
requirements of this Section. It is further required that programs for
the construction of areas of greater density concentration than
permitted on the entire tract will be offset by site improvements which,
because of their size and cost, are in proportion to the number of
dwelling units to be constructed in each stage. As an alternative to part
or all of the site improvements required to offset development densities
in excess of the overall permitted density, the Township may require the
reservation of open space by grant, easement or covenant in favor of
the Township in an amount and location necessary to balance the
excess development density of each stage.
16. Public Improvements. All streets, sidewalks, lighting and drainage
facilities therewith shall be designed and constructed in keeping with
the requirements of Chapter 22, Subdivision and Land Development.
17. Modifications. When, owing to special circumstances and conditions,
compliance with the provisions of this Section would result in
unnecessary hardship, the Board of Commissioners may make special,
reasonable modifications thereto as will not be contrary to the public
interest. Where a special, reasonable modification is requested, the
procedure is outlined by Chapter 22, Subdivision and Land
Development, for granting modifications shall be strictly adhered to
and followed.
18. Enforcement. To ensure the integrity of the development plan and to
guarantee that modifications in the plan do not adversely affect the
public interest, the enforcement and modification of the provisions of
the development plan as finally approved, whether they are recorded by
§ 309 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 309
1:615
plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, shall be subject to the following
provisions:
A. Provisions in Favor of Township. The provisions of the development
plan relating to the use, bulk and location of buildings and
structures, the quantity and location of common open space, except
as otherwise provided in this Section, and the intensity of use or the
density of residential units shall run in favor of the Township. As
provided by law, these provisions shall be enforceable in law or in
equity by the Township without limitation on any powers of
regulation otherwise granted the Township by law.
B. Provisions in Favor of Residents. All provisions of the development
plan shall run in favor of the residents of the planned residential
development but only to the extent expressly provided in the
development plan; also, provided, that these provisions, whether
recorded by plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, may be
enforced by law or equity by said residents acting individually,
jointly or through an organization designated in the development
plan to act on their behalf. No provision of the development plan
shall, however, be implied to exist in favor of residents of the
planned residential development except as to those portions of the
development plan which have been finally approved and have been
recorded.
C. Modifications. All those provisions of the development plan
authorized to be enforced by the Township under this Section may
be modified, removed or released by the Township, except grants
or easements relating to the service or equipment of a public utility,
subject to the following conditions:
(1) No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of
the development plan by the Township shall affect the rights of
the residents of the planned residential development to
maintain and enforce those provisions, at law or equity, as
provided in this Chapter.
(2) No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of
the development plan by the Township shall be permitted
except upon the finding by the Township Commissioners or its
designated agency, following a public hearing called and held
in accordance with the provisions of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code. These findings must indicate
that the changes are consistent with the efficient development
and preservation of the entire planned residential
development, do not adversely affect the enjoyment of land
abutting upon or across the street from the planned residential
development or the public interest and are not granted solely
to confer a special benefit upon any person.

D. Release of Rights. Residents of the planned residential
development may, to the extent and in the manner expressly
authorized by the provisions of the development plan, modify,
remove or release their rights to enforce the provisions of the
development plan, but no such action shall affect the right of the
Township to enforce the provisions of the development plan in
accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
1. Applications for such uses shall include a traffic impact study by a
qualified professional with content as follows:
A. Content of Traffic Impact Report. The traffic impact report shall
contain the following data and information:
(1) General Site Description. A detailed description of the roadway
network within 1/2 mile of the site, a description of the

generated by a proposed development, the traffic impact report
determines that need for a traffic signal or regulatory sign at or near
the site, the developer shall be responsible for contributing the pro rata
share of the cost of all said devices and signs attributable to the
proposed development.
3. Other Traffic Improvements. Whenever, as a result of additional traffic
generated by a proposed development, the traffic report identifies the
need for additional traffic lanes (acceleration, deceleration or turning)
or other traffic improvements, the developer shall be responsible for
contributing the pro rata share of the cost of all said improvements
attributable to the proposed development.
4. The traffic study shall demonstrate that the proposed conditional use
will not create traffic hazards or cause significant deterioration either
in the existing level of service or in the level of service that would exist
if the property were to be used by any use permitted as of right.
1. All fences and walls shall be kept and maintained in a good state of
repair and in harmony with the general beauty of the surrounding
neighborhood.
2. A permit for the erection of all fencing, walls, or screens shall be

different rows being no more than 10 feet apart, measured from the
vertical center lines of the trees. The depth of Buffer Area "A" shall
be 35 feet as measured from the property line.
B. Buffer Area "B" shall contain one row of plantings, which shall
consist of a mixture of 30% deciduous and 70% evergreen spaced
within the row a minimum of 10 feet apart, measured from the
vertical center lines of adjacent trees. The depth of Buffer Area "B"
shall be 25 feet as measured from the property line.
C. Buffer Area "C" shall be comprised of a continuous, compact
evergreen hedge or line of evergreen trees that will grow together
§ 313 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 314
1:630
when mature and that are a minimum of six feet in height at the
time of planting. The depth of Buffer Area "C" shall be 15 feet as
measured from the property line.
D. None of the required plantings shall encroach across any property
line. All plantings shall be located so that, at maturity, all parts of
the tree shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 of feet from any public street
right-of-way or any property line that constitutes the exterior
boundary of the buffer area.
E. In the event that existing vegetation and/or existing topography
provides screening that is adequate to meet the intent of the
required buffer area to screen the buildings, activities and parking
areas from adjoining residential properties, the Board of
Commissioners, upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission, may determine that the existing topography and/or
vegetation constitutes all or part of the required buffer area. If such
a determination is made, the applicant may be required to record a
conservation easement of the depth specified by the Board of
Commissioners to guarantee that the existing topography and/or
vegetation will not be disturbed or removed from the approved
buffer area.
F. In the event that a public street right-of-way, dedicated and
accepted by the Township, separates the two dissimilar uses
specified, the buffer area shall not be required.
G. In the case of a lot that is deeper than 400 feet, the requirement to
provide the buffer area along the entire perimeter of the lot may be
waived by the Township Commissioners, provided the required
buffer area is installed along the side property lines and across the
rear yard at a sufficient depth to screen the buildings and parking
areas from adjacent properties.
H. Openings for driveways shall be permitted to cross a required
buffer area. Plantings in required buffer areas shall be located so as
to not obstruct visibility for traffic entering or leaving a site.
I. No structures or uses shall be permitted in the required buffer
area, other than fences, active or passive recreation facilities and
stormwater management facilities, provided that the structures or
uses do not interfere with the required plantings in the buffer area,
and provided all plantings are located outside any stormwater
management structure. Structures or uses not permitted within the
required buffer area include, but are not limited to, buildings,
accessory structures, parking spaces and lighting devices.
J. When common open space is provided on a development site, the
required buffer area shall be located within the common open
space and shall not be located on any individual residential lot.
§ 314 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 314
1:631
314.2. Buffer Areas Required. Buffer Areas "A," "B" and "C" shall be
required under the following circumstances:
A. Buffer Area "A" shall be required:
(1) Along all property lines where any development in the M-1 or
M-2 Districts adjoins property in the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, B-1,
C-1, or S-1 Districts.
(2) Along all property lines where any development in the B-1
District adjoins property in any R District.
(3) Where the express standards and criteria for a conditional use
or use by special exception in this Chapter specify that Buffer
Area "A" is required.
(4) Along all property lines where a planned residential
development adjoins property in any R District.
(5) Along all property lines where multifamily dwellings adjoin
property in an R-1 or R-2 District.
B. Buffer Area "B" shall be required:
(1) Along all property lines where any development in the B-1
District and any nonresidential development in the C-1 or S-1
District adjoins property in any R District or any residential
property in the V District.
(2) Along all property lines where the expansion of a legal
nonconforming use in the V District or in any "R" District
adjoins property in an R District or residential property in the V
District.
(3) Where the express standards and criteria for a conditional use
or use by special exception in this Chapter specify that Buffer
Area "B" is required.
C. Buffer Area "C" shall be required:
(1) Where the express standards and criteria for a conditional use
or use by special exception in this Chapter specify that Buffer
Area "C" is required.
(2) On developed nonresidential properties in the B-1, C-1, S-1 or
V District where existing conditions such as building location
and existing paving of the parking lot make it impossible to
meet the requirements for Buffer Area "B" along a property
line that adjoins property in the R District or residential
property in the V District.
314.3. Conflict Between Buffer Area and Yard Requirements. When the
width of a required buffer area is in conflict with the minimum yard
requirements of this Chapter, the greater distance shall apply. The
§ 314 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 314
1:632
buffer area planting requirement shall be adhered to regardless of the
yard requirement.
314.4. Existing Structures in Buffer Areas. In instances where an existing
structure is located within any required buffer area, the buffer area may
be reduced, provided the buffer area is not less than the minimum
distance between the existing structure and the property line. This
reduced buffer area width shall apply only to the side of the existing
structure that encroaches on the required buffer area. The required
buffer area shall apply on all other sides of the existing structure.
314.5. Existing Trees in Buffer Areas.
A. Where trees already exist within the required buffer area, these
trees shall remain undisturbed, except that diseased or dead
material may be removed. If it is determined that some healthy
trees must be removed in conjunction with development, a written
request to remove such trees must be submitted to the Township,
along with an explanation detailing the rationale for the request.
These trees shall not be removed until the Township has given
written authorization permitting said removal. This permission will
not be unreasonably denied; however, those who violate this
Section shall be subject to the maximum penalties authorized by
this Chapter.
B. When any trees, regardless of their physical condition, are
removed, they shall be replaced by trees suitable to the
environment. (See Appendix A for a suggested list of plant
materials.83) All such replacement planting shall be in accordance
with accepted conservation practices.
C. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the existing
trees and landscaping in the buffer yard is equal to or exceeds the
required landscaping, the Planning Commission may permit the
existing trees and plantings to substitute for new plantings.
314.6. Size of Trees in Required Buffer Areas.
A. Any existing trees within the required buffer area that are a
minimum of four inches in diameter at a point one foot above the
ground shall be preserved and shall count as a required tree within
the buffer area. At no point, however, shall any existing trees and
required trees be separated at a distance greater than the distance
specified in the required Buffer Area.
B. All trees required to be planted within the buffer area shall be a
minimum of two inches in diameter at a point one foot above the
ground measured along the trunk of the planted tree, which shall
be planted in accordance with accepted conservation practices. All
required trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height at time of
83.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included at the end of this Chapter.

the top of the tree.
314.7. Responsibility for maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the
landowner or lessee to assure the continued growth of all required
landscaping and/or to replace the same in the event of frost, vandalism,
disease or other reasons for the discontinued growth of the required
trees, shrubs and bushes. Upon inspection by the Township and
issuance of an enforcement notice, the landowner or lessee shall
replace required landscaping materials with like type and size if the
required plant materials do not survive for any reason at any time after
occupancy of the property.
314.8. Stormwater Management Facilities in Buffer Areas. Stormwater
management facilities and structures may be maintained within a
buffer area, but the existence of such facilities or structures shall not be
a basis for a failure to meet the planting requirements.
314.9. Landscaping of Open Areas. All yard areas not utilized for parking
facilities, driveways, gardens, the planting of trees or shrubs or flower,
vegetable or herb beds or similar uses shall be seeded, sodded or
landscaped within a reasonable period of time. The phrase "a
reasonable period of time" shall be interpreted to be within two weeks
after construction activities are completed, unless those activities are
completed between a November 1 through April 1 time period. In such
case, the required sodding or seeding shall occur by April 15, and
erosion and sedimentation controls acceptable to the Township
Engineer shall be installed during the winter months and until such
landscaping is completed.

§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:669
A. The applicant shall show the proposed routes of all trucks to be
utilized for hauling to and from the gas and oil well site and the
estimated weights of those trucks. The applicant shall show
evidence of compliance with designated weight limits on Township
streets, unless a bond and an excess maintenance agreement to
assure road damage repair is provided, and shall design the
hauling routes to minimize the use of and impact upon Township
streets wherever feasible. The applicant shall also show evidence
satisfactory to the Township Engineer that intersections along
proposed hauling routes provide a sufficient turning radius for
trucks to be utilized for hauling, such that all turns can be safely
made without damage to vehicles, sidewalks or curbs.
B. The applicant or operator shall post a bond or other financial
security in favor of the Township and in a form acceptable to the
Township prior to beginning operations to guarantee maintenance
and repair during construction/drilling/fracturing and postoperation
restoration of Township streets which may be
determined, in the reasonable opinion of the Township Engineer, to
be damaged as a result of traffic generated by gas and oil well
generated traffic. In addition, if the Township Engineer concludes
that gas and oil well generated traffic will cause substantial
damage to a Township road, then the applicant must, before
operations begin, enter into an agreement with the Township
undertaking the responsibility to repair the road to the extent
determined in the reasonable discretion of the Township Engineer,
which agreement may provide for a bond to be posted in excess of
otherwise applicable PennDOT limits when the Township Engineer
has reasonably estimated that the cost of repair will exceed the
PennDOT limits. In addition, should the Township Engineer
reasonably determine that preventive measures, such as shoring of
bridges or putting protective mats over utility lines, should be
taken to prevent damage to Township roads, bridges or utilities,
then the applicant shall install such protective measures as
directed by the Township Engineer, prior to beginning operations.
C. Prior to the commencement of oil or gas well drilling activities, the
actual commencement of mining activity, no construction activities
involving excavation of, alteration to or repair work on any access
road to the site of the mineral removal or upon an oil or gas well
site or other site of mineral removal shall be performed during the
hours of 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
D. The Township recognizes and acknowledges that oil and gas
development is accompanied by inherent noise. The regulations in
this Section are intended and shall be interpreted and applied to
establish a process for reasonable noise control that provides for
response to individual complaints and requires that undue noise be
addressed, where feasible, without the Township dictating the
particular operational steps that must be taken. The operator shall
§ 408 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 408
1:670
take the following steps to minimize, to the extent practicable, the
noise resulting from the development:
(1) Prior to drilling of an oil and gas well, the operator shall
establish a continuous seventy-two-hour ambient noise level at
the nearest protected structure property line or 100 feet from
the nearest protected structure (as measured to the closest
exterior point of the building), whichever is closer to the
protected structure, or, alternatively, and in lieu of establishing
the above seventy-two-hour ambient noise level, the operator
may assume and use, for the purposes of compliance with this
Chapter, a default ambient noise level of 55 dBA. The sound
level meter used in conducting any evaluation shall meet the
American National Standards Institute standard for sound
meters or an instrument and the associated recording and
analyzing equipment which will provide equivalent data. For
the purposes of this chapter a “protected structure” shall be
any occupied residence, commercial business, school or
church located within 1,000 feet of the surface location of an
oil or gas well that may be impacted by noise generated from
drilling or hydraulic fracturing activity at an oil or gas well,
excluding any structure owned by an oil and gas lessor who has
signed a lease with the operator granting surface drilling
rights to drill the subject well or whose owner (or occupants)
has signed a waiver relieving the operator from
implementation of the measures established in Subsection 33D
of this section for the owner’s or occupant’s benefit.
(2) The operator shall provide documentation of any established,
seventy-two-hour evaluation, relied upon to establish an
ambient noise level greater than 55 dBA, to the Township’s
Zoning Officer within three business days of such a request
from the Zoning Officer.
(3) Protected Structures.
(a) The noise generated during drilling and hydraulic
fracturing activities, when measured at the nearest
protected structure property line or 100 feet from the
nearest protected structure (as measured to the closest
exterior point of the building), whichever is closer to the
protected structure, shall not exceed the average ambient
noise level (as determined by the seventy-two-hour
evaluation) or default level, whichever is higher:
[1] During drilling activities, by more than 7dB during the
hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
[2] During drilling activities, by more than 5dB during the
hours of 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:671
[3] By more than 10dB during hydraulic fracturing
operations.
(b) The operator shall inform the Township of which level
(average ambient noise level or default level) is being
used.
(c) The operator shall provide for ongoing regular noise level
monitoring at a station to be located at or near the nearest
protected structure property line or 100 feet from the
nearest protected structure (as measured to the closest
exterior point of the building), whichever is closer to the
protected structure. The noise monitoring data acquired at
this station shall be made available to the Township upon
request.
(4) Adjustments to the foregoing noise limits may be permitted in
accordance with the following:
Permitted Increase
Duration of Increase
(minutes)*
5 dBA 15
10 dBA 5
15 dBA 1
20 dBA 1
NOTES:
*Cumulative minutes during any one hour.
(5) If a complaint is received by the Township from any person,
whether a resident or otherwise, using the protected structure
for any lawful purpose within 1,000 feet from the wellhead or
equipment generating noise during drilling or hydraulic
fracturing activities, the operator shall, within 24 hours of
receipt of the complaint from the Township, continuously
monitor for a forty-eight-hour period at a point which is the
closer to the complainant’s building of:
(a) The complainant’s protected structure property line
nearest to the well site or equipment generating the noise;
or
(b) One hundred feet from the protected structure.
(6) Once the monitoring is complete, the operator will provide
monitoring data to the Township and will meet with Township
representatives and affected property owners and will, within
one week of the meeting, submit a noise-abatement plan to
effectively mitigate any noise exceeding the permitted levels.
§ 408 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 408
1:672
In determining the noise-mitigation measures to be employed,
the Township may, at the expense of the operator, utilize the
services of a consultant with expertise in noise measurement,
noise abatement and gas and oil well drilling and operation.
(7) Exhaust from any internal combustion engine or compressor
used in connection with the drilling of any well or for use on
any production equipment or used in development shall not be
discharged into the open air unless it is equipped with an
exhaust muffler or an exhaust box. The exhaust muffler or
exhaust box shall be constructed of noncombustible materials
designed and installed to suppress noise and disruptive
vibrations. Moreover, all such equipment with an exhaust
muffler or exhaust box shall be maintained in good operating
condition according to manufacturer’s specifications.
(8) All workover operations shall be restricted to the hours of 6:00
a.m. to 10:00 p.m., except as necessary, as reasonably
determined by the operator. “Workover operations” shall mean
work performed in a well after its completion in an effort to
secure production where there has been none, restore
production that has ceased, or increase production.
(9) In cases where noise has exceed permitted levels and it is
economically feasible for gas and oil well drilling rigs to be
outfitted with acoustic barrier insulation blankets, such
barriers shall be installed in accordance with best
management practices in the industry; provided, however, that
no such acoustic barrier shall be required where its use would
be contrary to a preempted applicable state or federal
regulations or where its use would create a safety hazard in the
opinion of the Township Engineer or of any regulatory agency
with jurisdiction.
(10) This Subsection 33D shall not apply to conventional oil and gas
well drilling and completion activities; i.e., those wells drilled
to depths shallower than the base of the elk sandstone or its
stratigraphic equivalent, or to such oil and gas wells that are
planned to involve either drilling or fracking, or both, of a
single well on a well site for no more than seven consecutive
days total in any calendar year; provided, however, that if the
well site is within 1,000 feet of a residentially occupied
property, then Subsection 33N shall apply.
(11) In order for the Township to appropriately enforce the
conditions imposed by this Chapter, to make certain that the
health, safety and welfare of its citizens are met and to
determine if the use remains compatible with various zoning
districts in the Township, if the operator engages in any noise
testing as required by this chapter, it will provide the final
§ 408 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 408
1:673
results to the Township within 10 business days of the
operator’s receipt of those final results.
E. Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, sufficient
parking shall be provided to allow all vehicles associated with the
gas and oil well operation to be parked off street. Parking areas
within 200 feet of an occupied building not associated with the gas
and oil well operation shall provide a slag or stone or other surface
designed to minimize dust or, alternatively, dust-reduction
measures such as water sprinkling whenever necessary. Access
roads to the well site shall be improved to a dust-free, all-weather
surface in such manner than no water sediment or debris will be
carried onto any public street or adjoining property.
F. The operator shall take all necessary steps to ensure that public
roads remain free of dirt, mud or debris resulting from gas and oil
well traffic or activities, including road sweeping and tire washing
if needed. Where traffic generated by the gas and oil well is heavy
in the proximity of school bus stops, the operator will provide, at its
expense, flagmen to ensure the safety of children waiting for or
leaving school buses, and the operator will take measures to
eliminate unnecessary truck traffic to or from the site during school
bus operation hours in the morning and afternoon.
G. The operator shall, prior to drilling and once per year thereafter,
provide an opportunity for Township emergency service providers
to arrange visits to the well site for the purpose of being oriented to
the location, equipment, materials used at and layout of the site.
Such orientation visits shall be mutually arranged between the
operator and the chief officer of any given emergency service
provider.
(1) The operator shall provide appropriate maps, material data
safety sheets, and emergency plan documents to such chief
officers and to the Township Secretary. Emergency response
plans shall address well leakage, spill containment, vandalism,
defective casing or cementing and communications between
the well operator and the public water supplier.
(2) The operator shall provide 24/7 emergency contact
information, including a supervisor’s name and a toll-free
phone number, to all Township emergency service providers
and to the Township Secretary, as well as on signage at the well
site.
H. Where a gas and oil well is located within 1,000 feet of a protected
structure, the operator shall:
(1) Install temporary safety fencing at least six feet high around
drilling, fracturing and hydraulic equipment and install
permanent fall-protection fencing meeting OSHA requirements
§ 408 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 408
1:674
around any pit for impoundment of liquid at a depth greater
than two feet;
(2) Install warning signs at the well site; and

material submitted by the landowner and shall also consider:

woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the

declaration and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the
substantive invalidity of the unamended zoning ordinance for which

absence or disqualification of a member, a quorum is not reached,
the Chairman of the Zoning Hearing Board shall designate as many
alternate members of the Zoning Hearing Board to sit on the
Zoning Hearing Board as may be needed to reach a quorum. Any
alternate member of the Zoning Hearing Board shall continue to
serve on the Zoning Hearing Board in all proceedings involving the

the Zoning Hearing Board has made a final determination of the
matter or case. Designation of an alternate pursuant to this
Subsection shall be made on a case-by-case basis in rotation
according to declining seniority among all alternates.
C. Removal of Members. Any Zoning Hearing Board member may be
removed for malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance in the office,

1:709
held in connection with the vote if the member shall request it in
writing.

membership its officers, who shall serve annual terms as such and
may succeed themselves.

action, a quorum shall be not less than a majority of all members of
the Zoning Hearing Board except when member(s) of the Zoning
Hearing Board are disqualified to act in a particular matter,
alternate members shall be appointed to provide a quorum.
C. Hearing Officer. The Zoning Hearing Board may appoint a hearing
officer from its own membership to conduct any hearing on its
behalf, and the parties may waive further action by the Zoning
Hearing Board and accept the findings or decision of the hearing
officer as final.

rescind rules and forms for its procedure, consistent with
ordinances of the Township and laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.

the following matters:
A. Substantive challenges to the validity of any land use ordinance,
except curative amendments brought before the Board of
Commissioners.

procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption which challenges shall be raised by an
appeal taken within 30 days after the effective date of the
ordinance.
C. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including,
but not limited to, the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to
act on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease and desist
order or the registration or refusal to register any nonconforming
use, structure or lot.
D. Appeals from a determination by the Township Engineer or the
Zoning Officer with reference to the administration of any
§ 510 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 510
1:710
floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within a
land use ordinance.
E. Applications for variances from the terms of this Chapter and flood

as amended).
H. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Township
Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or
provision thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion
control and stormwater management insofar as the same relate to
development not involving subdivision and land development or
planned residential development.
510.4. Variances. The Zoning Hearing Board, upon appeal, shall have the
power to authorize variances from the requirements of this Chapter and
to attach such conditions to the variance as it deems necessary to
assure compliance with the purposes of this Chapter. A variance may be
granted if all of the following findings are made where relevant in a
given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter in
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this Chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
§ 510 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 510
1:711
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance necessary to afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
510.5. Uses by Special Exception. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the
power to hear and decide on applications for uses by special exception
as authorized by this Chapter, in harmony with its general purpose and
intent, and in accordance with the standards set forth in Part 4. The
Zoning Hearing Board shall approve a use by special exception only if it
meets all applicable requirements of this Chapter and the express
standards and criteria set forth in Part 4. In granting a use by special
exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach such reasonable
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this Chapter, as it may
deem necessary to properly implement this Chapter and protect the
public health, safety and welfare.
510.6. Notice and Conduct of Hearings.
A. Notice.

communicate, directly or indirectly, with any party or his
representatives in connection with any issue involved except

each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions based thereon, together with the reasons therefor.
Conclusions based on any provisions of any ordinance, rule or
regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on

decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the
applicant, unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the

decision, the Zoning Hearing Board shall give public notice of the
decision within 10 days from the last day it could have met to
render a decision in the same manner as provided in § 510.6A. If
§ 510 HARRISON TOWNSHIP CODE § 510

right of any party opposing the application to appeal the decision

Zoning Hearing Board initiate mediation or participate as a
mediating party. Mediation shall supplement, not replace, those
procedures in this Section once they have been formally initiated.
Nothing in this Subsection shall be interpreted as expanding or
limiting municipal police powers or as modifying any principles of
substantive law.
B. Participation in mediation shall be wholly voluntary. The
appropriateness of mediation shall be determined by the

participate.

the mediation sessions shall be open or closed to the public.

procedures set forth in this Chapter.
C. No offers or statements made in the mediation sessions, excluding
the final written mediated agreement, shall be admissible as
evidence in any subsequent judicial or administrative proceedings.

with respect to hearings before the Zoning Hearing Board. Fees for
said hearings may include compensation for the Secretary and
members of the Zoning Hearing Board, notice and advertising costs
and necessary administrative overhead connected with the

Zoning Hearing Board, expenses for engineering, architectural or
other technical consultants or expert witness costs.
B. Stenographer's Appearance Fee and Transcripts. The appearance
fee for a stenographer shall be shared equally by the applicant and

be paid by the Zoning Hearing Board if the transcript is ordered by
the Zoning Hearing Board or hearing officer or shall be paid by the
person appealing from the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board if
such appeal is made and, in either event the cost of additional
copies shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies.
In other cases the party requesting the original transcript shall
bear the cost thereof.
C. Expenditures. Members of the Zoning Hearing Board may receive
compensation for the performance of their duties as may be fixed
by the Board of Commissioners, but in no case shall it exceed the
rate of compensation authorized to be paid to the members of the
Board of Commissioners. Within the limits of funds appropriated by
the Board of Commissioners, the Zoning Hearing Board may
employ or contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel,
consultants and other technical services.
510.10. Time Limitations.
A. No person shall file any proceeding before the Zoning Hearing
Board later than 30 days after a preliminary or final application for
development has been approved by an appropriate Township
officer, agency or body, if such proceeding is designed to secure
reversal or to limit the approval in any manner, unless such person
alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to
believe that such approval had been given. If such person has
succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by
the knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
B. The failure of anyone, other than the landowner, to appeal from an
adverse decision on an application for tentative approval of a
planned residential development or from an adverse decision by a
Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of an ordinance or map

A. Upon filing of any proceeding and during its pendency before the
Zoning Hearing Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of
any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be
stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency
or body certifies to the Zoning Hearing Board facts indicating that
such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which
case the development or official action shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order that may be granted by the
Zoning Hearing Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or other
appropriate agency or body. When an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings
designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Zoning
Hearing Board by persons other than the applicant, the applicant
may petition the court having jurisdiction of the zoning appeals to
order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing the
proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board. The question
whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of
the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court.
B. All appeals from decisions rendered by the Zoning Hearing Board
shall be taken to the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas and
shall be filed within 30 days after the entry of the decision or, in the
case of a deemed decision, within 30 days after the date upon
which notice of said deemed decision is given as required by
