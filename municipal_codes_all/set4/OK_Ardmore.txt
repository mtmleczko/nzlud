PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the mayor and board of commissioners. 
    As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, this Code supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. The Code contains any ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included herein. For more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to correlative charter provisions and relevant state laws have been included. Also, the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 15 is 15-14. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-2 and 4-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-2.1, 4-2.2, 4-2.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a decimal after the chapter number; e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the numerical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new Chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President and Donald R. Alexander of the editorial staff of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to Frederick L. Sheppard for his work on the index and to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Andrew B. Riddle, Jr., City Attorney, Mr. Gerald Wilkins, City Manager and all other city officials for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Ardmore, Oklahoma.

He shall then attach his certificate to the petition. If his certificate states that the petition has not been prepared and circulated as required and/or lacks a sufficient number of signatures, the petition shall have no effect; and recall proceedings may not again be initiated against the same person within six months after date of the certificate. But, if the city clerk's certificate states that the petition has been prepared and circulated as required and has a sufficient number of signatures, he shall submit the petition and certificate to the commission at its next meeting.

Upon receipt of such complaint, the chief executive officer shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within thirty (30) days after receiving a complaint, or within thirty days (30) days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c) of this section, the chief executive officer shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it.

(b)  A complaint under subsection (a) of this section shall be filed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time.

Both complaints and answers shall be verified. 
(c)  If within thirty (30) days after a complaint is filed with the chief executive officer, the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this chapter, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days thereafter, file a complaint with the secretary of the department of housing and urban development. The chief executive officer will assist in this filing.

If the court finds that discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice order, such affirmative action as may be appropriate.

The chief executive officer may issue subpoenas to compel his access to or the production of such material, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States District Court for the district in which the investigation is taking place. The chief executive officer may administer oaths. 
(b)  Upon written application to the chief executive officer, a respondent shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the chief executive officer himself.

(d)  Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such person may petition the chief executive officer to revoke or modify the subpoena. The chief executive officer shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason. 
(e)  In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the chief executive officer or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business. 
(f)  Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or other evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the chief executive officer shall be fined not more that one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned not more than one (1) year or both. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the chief executive officer, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted to chief executive officer pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true, and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary evidence, shall be fined not more that one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned not more than one (1) year, or both.

A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or section 9.5-10 from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the chief executive officer are likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained of in the complaint made to the chief executive officer and which practice forms the basis for the action in court; and provided, however, that any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this ordinance, and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter shall not be affected. 
(b)  The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) punitive damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the said plaintiff in the opinion of the court is not financially able to assume said attorney's fees.

Chapter 10.5 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2896, Art. I-Art. V, adopted April 5, 2010, did not specifically amend the Code; therefore, these provisions have been included as Ch. 10.5, § 10.5-1-10.5-64, at the editor's discretion. 

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 10.5-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma has in (statutes) 82 O.S. §§ 1601-1618, as amended, chapter 23 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City of Ardmore, Oklahoma, ordains the following. 
(Ord. No. 2896, § Art. I, § A, 4-5-10) 
Sec. 10.5-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Ardmore are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2896, § Art. I, § B, 4-5-10) 
Sec. 10.5-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2896, § Art. I, § C, 4-5-10) 
Sec. 10.5-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
(a)  In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(b)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(c)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(d)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(e)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(f)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2896, § Art. I, § D, 4-5-10) 
Secs. 10.5-5-10.5-19. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 10.5-20. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Accessory structure means structures which are on the same parcel of property as the principle structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principle structure (such as garages and storage sheds). 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM for Carter County, Zone A is refined into Zones A and AE. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation means the elevation in feet above mean sea level of the base flood or one-percent chance flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Board means the Oklahoma Water Resources Board. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building built, in the case of a building in Zones A, AE and X, to have the top of the elevated floor adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A, AE and X, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. Existing construction may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the floodway width, section area and mean velocity. 
    Floodplain administrator means a person accredited by the board and designated by a city council, to administer and implement laws and regulations relating to the management of the floodplains. 
    Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or; 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system, which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure, and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions, or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of these regulations or ordinance when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by these regulations. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Sections 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10) or (d)(3) [of the Nation Flood Insurance Program Regulations] is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 10.5-42(b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (article I, section 10.5-3). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulations or ordinances. 
(3)  A written notice will be provided to any person granted a variance to build a structure below the base flood elevation. This notice will inform the variance applicant that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from permitting the structure to be built lower than the base flood elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in subsection subsections (a)-(i) are met, and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(l)  Any person seeking a variance shall file a petition with the board of adjustment, accompanied by a filing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). 
(m)  A copy of any variance issued shall be sent to the OWRB within in fifteen (15) days of issuance.

A copy of the notice shall be posted on the property to be affected. In addition, a copy of said notice shall be sent by mail to the property owner at the address shown by the current year's tax rolls in the office of the county treasurer. Written notice shall also be mailed to any mortgage holder as shown by the records in the office of the county clerk to the last-known address of the mortgagee. At the time of mailing of notice to any property owner or mortgage holder, the city shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee. However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property, or by publication notice in the Daily Ardmoreite.

The governing body shall fix reasonable dates for the commencement and completion of the work. The municipal clerk shall immediately file a notice of dilapidation and lien with the county clerk describing the property, the findings of the municipality at the hearing, and stating that the city claims a lien on said property for the destruction and removal costs and that such costs are the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date of filing of said notice.

If dismantling and removal of the dilapidated buildings is done on a private contract basis, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder. 
(5)  When payment is made to the city for costs incurred, the municipal clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment attributable to the actual cost of the dismantling and removal of the buildings is not made within six (6) months from the date of the mailing of the statement to the owner of such property, the municipal clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount of the cost to the county treasurer of the county in which the property is located.

In addition the cost and the interest thereon shall be a lien against the property from the date the notice of the lien is filed with the county clerk. Said lien shall be coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior and superior to all other titles and liens against the property. The lien shall continue until the cost is fully paid. At the time of collection, the county treasurer shall collect a fee of five dollars ($5.00) for each parcel of property. Said fee shall be deposited to the credit of the general fund of the county. At any time prior to collection as provided for in this paragraph, the city may pursue any civil remedy for collection of the amount owning and interest thereon including an action in personam against the property owner and an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral interest, if severed from the surface interest and not owned by the surface owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this section. Upon receiving payment, the municipal clerk shall forward to the county treasurer a notice of such payment and shall direct discharge of the lien.

Sec. 19-101. - Title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Ordinance Regulating the Presence and Conduct of Minors on Streets and Public Places." 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 2, 5-22-92) 
Sec. 19-102. - Definitions. 
    The following words and phrases when used in this article, shall have the meanings prescribed in this section except in those cases where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    A minor is any person under the age of eighteen (18). 
    A parent is any person having legal custody of a minor as a natural or adoptive parent; as a legal guardian; as a person who stands in loco parentis; or as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the court. 
    Public place shall mean any street, alley, highway, sidewalk, park, playground or place to which the general public has access and a right to resort for business, entertainment, or other lawful purpose. A public place shall include, but not be limited to, any store, shop, restaurant, tavern, bowling alley, cafe, theater, drugstore, pool room shopping center and any other place devoted to amusement or entertainment of the general public. It shall also include the front or immediate area of the above. 
    Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four (4) or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. 
    Street is a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the cartway or traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. 
    Time of night referred to here is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Central Standard Time or Central Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at that hour by the public. 
    Year of age continues from one (1) birthday, such as the seventeenth to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making it clear that seventeen (17) or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under eighteen (18) years of age." 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 2, 5-22-92) 
Sec. 19-103. - Time of curfew. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person seventeen (17) or less years of age (under eighteen (18)) to be or remain in or upon the streets or in any public place within the city at night during the period beginning at 1:00 a.m. and ending at 6:00 a.m. 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 2, 5-22-92; Ord. No. 2680, § I, 5-7-01) 
Sec. 19-104. - Exceptions. 
    In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a city street during the nocturnal hours for which section 19-103 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not, however, be considered in violation of this article: 
(1)  When accompanied by a parent of such minor. 
(2)  When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area. 
(3)  When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by possessing a written communication, signed by such minor and countersigned by a parent of such minor and with their home address and telephone number, specifying when, where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night (during hours when this ordinance is otherwise applicable to said minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communication. 
(4)  In case of reasonable necessity, but only if the minor has in said minor's possession a written communication signed by the minor, countersigned by a parent of such minor evidencing their home address and telephone number, and establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and destination. 
(5)  When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an objection to the police officer. 
(6)  When returning home, by a direct route from (and within thirty (30) minutes of the termination of) a school activity, or an activity of a religious or voluntary association; provided the minor has a written communication in the minor's possession, countersigned by the parent indicating the home address and telephone number, the purpose for the event, when, where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night. 
(7)  When authorized, by regulation issued by the city council, in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the city council permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than thirty (30) minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity, and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this article. 
(8)  When the minor carries a certified card of employment, briefly identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and his place of employment and his hours of employment or carries a valid proof of employment which may include the latest payroll receipt not over thirty (30) days old. 
(9)  When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This contemplates normal travel. This clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement through the city, particularly on normal routes. 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 2, 5-22-92) 
Sec. 19-105. - Parental responsibility. 
    It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or, by inefficient control, to allow such minor to be or remain upon any city street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this article. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 2, 5-22-92) 
Sec. 19-106. - Police procedures. 
    A police officer of the city, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of this article, shall immediately notify the parent of such minor. 
(1)  The police officer shall file a written report, or shall participate to the extent of the information for which he is responsible, in accordance with current police department policy; said report shall be treated for purposes of juvenile records in accordance with state statutes. 
(2)  When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located the minor may be temporarily entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other adult who will, on behalf of a parent, assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent. 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 2, 5-22-92; Ord. No. 2680, § II, 5-7-01) 
Sec. 19-107. - Responsibility of owners of public places. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person operating or having charge of any public place to knowingly allow, permit or suffer the presence of minors in violation of the curfew established by this article. 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 2, 5-22-92) 
Sec. 19-108. - Penalty. 
(a)  If, after the warning pursuant to section 19-106 of a first violation by a minor, a parent violates section 19-105 (in connection with the second violation by said minor), this shall be treated as an offense by the parent. The penalty upon a plea of guilt, nolo contender, or finding of guilt shall be a fine of up to one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(b)  Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of this article more than one (1) time shall be reported to the juvenile court for treatment, supervision and rehabilitation of such minor. 
(c)  A like procedure, before the juvenile authorities, shall be followed in any case where imposing of a fine of fines upon a parent shall not be effective, or where for any reason the provisions of this article cannot be made effective by imposing penalties under this section.

Sec. 25-53. - Minimum driveway standards. 
(A)  TERMS USED. 
(1)  Frontage: The length along the street right-of-way line of a single property tract or roadside development area between the boundary edges of the property. Corner property at a street intersection has a separate frontage along each street. 
(2)  Frontage boundary line: A line, normal to the street centerline, at each end of the frontage, extending from the right-of-way line to the edge of through-traffic lane. 
(3)  Driveway: Property used for motor vehicle access to private property from public streets. 
(4)  Driveway width: Narrowest width of driveway measured parallel with the edge of traveled way. 
(5)  Driveway angle: The angle of ninety (90) degrees or less between the driveway center line and the edge of the traveled way. 
(6)  Edge clearance: The distance measured along the edge of the traveled way, between the frontage boundary line and tangent projection of the nearest edge of driveway. 
(7)  Corner clearance: At an intersection street or highway, the dimensions measured along the edge of the traveled way between the frontage boundary line opposite the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines and the tangent projection of the nearest edge of driveway. NOTE: No driveway radius is to fall within a corner radius. 
(8)  Outside radius: The outside or larger curve radius on edge of driveway. 
(9)  Inside radius: The inside or smaller curve radius on edge of driveway, used when substantially less than ninety (90) degrees. 
(10)  Buffer area (border area): That portion of land between the right-of-way line and the curbline, or if none, the outside edge of shoulder, or roadway, if no shoulder. 
(11)  Distance between double driveways: The distance measured along the right-of-way line between the tangent projections of the inside edges of two (2) adjacent driveways to the same frontage. 
    General. For simplicity, the above definitions are stated in terms of single radius curves of edge of driveways or intersecting streets. Where compound curves or tapers are used, an equivalent single radius curve may be used as a control guide. 
    The above definitions recognize that shoulders on all streets will not always be surfaced and therefore driveways are considered to extend to the outer edge of through traffic lane. Where the major street includes a hard-surfaced all-weather shoulder on the right, or where there are established curb lines, the dimensions shall be measured along the outer edge of shoulder or curb line. 
(B)  CONTROL DIMENSIONS. 
(1)  Edge clearance: 
(a)  General: All portions of the driveway shall be within the frontage boundary line. 
1.  For driveways with angles of about ninety (90) degrees the edge clearance shall not be less than the radius of curvature for the junction of the driveway and pavement (shoulder) edges. 
2.  Residential: Five (5) feet minimum. 
3.  Commercial: Fifteen (15) feet minimum. 
(2)  Width: 
(a)  Residential: 
1.  Ten (10) feet minimum. 
2.  Twenty (20) feet maximum for garages that have a capacity of up to two (2) vehicles. 
3.  Thirty (30) feet maximum for garages that have a capacity of more than two (2) vehicles, subject to the following conditions. 
A.  That the driveway is onto a residential street other than a collector or arterial street as shown on the city's street classification plan. 
B.  That any driveway shall not cover more than fifty (50) per cent of the required street yard setback. 
C.  That any driveway shall not take up more than fifty (50) per cent of the lot frontage along the street. 
D.  An exception to B and C above may be administratively approved for lots on cul-de-sac and "eyebrow" locations where reduced street frontage exists. 
(b)  Commercial: Twenty-five (25) feet maximum. Larger drives can be granted should design features justify the additional width. 
(3)  Driveway angle: 
(a)  Driveways for two-way operation: Ninety (90) degrees to minimum sixty (60) degrees for maximum sight distance. 
(b)  Driveways for one-way operation: Driveway used by vehicles in both directions of travel on streets, same as for two-way operation. Driveways, used by vehicles in one direction of travel on streets (right turn only): Sixty (60) degrees maximum; forty-five (45) degrees minimum. 
(4)  Radius of curvature or junction of driveway and pavement: 
Classification Radius Minimum Residential 5 feet Commercial 25 feet  
(5)  Distance between double driveways: Fifteen (15) feet minimum, or if parallel island is present, same as length of island-whichever is the longer. 
(6)  Corner clearance: The corner clearance for all driveways shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet. 
(C)  NUMBER OF DRIVEWAYS. 
(1)  Residential lots: No residential lot shall have more than two (2) driveways on each street of which the lot has frontage.

(D)  DRIVEWAY PROFILE. 
(1)  No street edge curb, cut section: 
(a)  From edge of traveled way to outer edge of shoulder, gradient same as shoulder pitch. 
(b)  From outer edge of shoulder to low point at ditch line or over culvert, maximum downward gradient five (5) to eight (8) per cent. 
(c)  Beyond ditch line, maximum gradient five (5) to eight (8) per cent for commercial driveways or ten (10) to fifteen (15) per cent for others. 
(2)  No street edge curb, fill section: 
(a)  Slope across shoulder, gradient same as shoulder pitch. 
(b)  Beyond outer edge of shoulder maximum gradient five (5) to eight (8) per cent for commercial driveways or ten (10) to fifteen (15) per cent for others. 
(3)  With street edge curbs: Driveway profile should slope upward from gutter line to meet the sidewalk, if any, with maximum difference between downward cross slope of traveled way and upward slope of driveway of eight (8) to ten (10) per cent; beyond outer edge of walk of equivalent maximum gradient plus five (5) to eight (8) per cent for commercial driveways or plus ten (10) to fifteen (15) per cent for others. 
(4)  Vertical curve: As flat as feasible. To prevent drag, vertical curves shall avoid a hump or dip greater than about six (6) inches within wheel base length of ten (10) feet. For recent model passenger cars, to prevent center or overhang drag, with some allowance for load and bounce, crest vertical curves shall not exceed a three and one-quarter (31/4) inch hump in a ten-foot chord and sag vertical curves shall not exceed a two-inch depression in ten-foot chord. 
(E)  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS. When curb sections of publicly owned streets are removed for driveway purposes, Portland cement concrete driveways shall be constructed. Such concrete driveways shall extend from a minimum of two (2) feet from the back of the curb toward the private property. From that point to the private property line, the driveway shall be constructed of Portland cement or asphaltic concrete. (Note: Required sidewalks must be constructed of Portland cement). Residential driveways shall taper from a depth of six and one-half (61/2) inches at the curb to a depth of four (4) inches at the private property line. Commercial driveways shall taper from a depth of six and one-half (61/2) inches at the curb to a depth of six (6) inches at the private property line.

It hereby is declared to be the purpose of the additional one (1) per cent excise tax levied by Ordinance No. 1523, as amended by Ordinance No. 1525 and by this Ordinance No. 1821, to make payments into the sinking fund of the City of Ardmore, Oklahoma, in relation to the bonded indebtedness of said city outstanding at this time, and the bonded indebtedness of said city in the principal amount of seven million dollars ($7,000,000.00) to be voted upon at a special election to be held in said city on August 3, 1976, to provide funds for the purpose of extending and improving the water system of said city. The revenues derived by reason of said additional one (1) per cent excise tax shall be deposited into a special fund from which payments shall be made so that, as nearly as practicable, and consistent with the revenues produced thereby, the ad valorem tax levied in each year for all of said bonds, until the said bond issue to be voted upon on August 3, 1976, shall have been paid or full provision for its payment made, shall not exceed nineteen (19) mills on each one dollar ($1.00) of taxable valuation of real and personal property located in said city.

(a)  The city will construct a six-inch looped water line from Hess Road north to the twelve-inch line located on Highway 70. A buy-in area of property to be served by the construction of the water line has been established and described by the city engineering department along with a cost-per-acre buy-in cost. The buy-in area determined by the city engineering department is described as follows: 
The E/2 of the NE/4 of the NW/4, and the NE/4 of the SE/4 of the NW/4, and the NW/4 of the SE/4 of the NW/4 and the SW/4 of the NE/4 of the NW/4, and the W/2 of the SE/4 of the SE/4 of the NW/4, and the NW/4 of the NE/4 of the NE/4 of the SW/4, and the NE/4 of the NW/4 of the NE/4 of the SW/4, and the E/2 of the NW/4 of the SW/4 of the NE/4, and the NE/4 of the SW/4 of the NE/4, and the NW/4 of the SE/4 of the NE/4, and the E/2 of the SW/4 of the SW/4 of the NE/4, and the SE/4 of the SW/4 of the NE/4, all in Section 34, Township 4 South, Range 1 East, in the City of Ardmore, Carter County, Oklahoma. 
    A map of the buy-in area is attached to this section and made a part hereof for all purposes. The buy-in area is outlined in red. The proposed route of the six-inch looped water line is shown on the map in blue. 
(b)  The buy-in cost is based on estimates only at this time and is subject to review and change by the board of commissioners after the actual construction cost of the water line has been determined. The buy-in cost has been determined by the city engineering department to be one (1) per cent of the actual construction cost of the water line per acre owned by the party seeking to tap into the six-inch looped water line, as provided in section (c) of this section. 
(c)  Any owner of up to five (5) acres of property located in the buy-in area, before being allowed the right to tap the six-inch looped water line, must pay the applicable buy-in charge, in full. 
    Any owner of land exceeding five (5) acres, before being allowed to tap the six-inch looped water line, must pay the applicable buy-in charge for five (5) acres at the time of tapping into the six-inch water line. The balance of the buy-in charge due for any land in the buy-in area owned by the applicant in excess of five (5) acres shall be paid in full within ten (10) years from the date of the original tap. A water meter may only be installed to serve the original five (5) acre tract. No additional water meter or tap may be installed to serve the balance of property owned by the applicant until the buy-in charge for the remaining property has been paid in full. Additionally, it shall be unlawful and punishable by a fine for the applicant to use water from the original tap to serve the five (5) acre tract, for any purpose on any remaining land owned by the applicant until the buy-in charge applicable to that remaining land has been paid in full. 
    Additionally, before being allowed to tap the six-inch looped water line the owner of the property located in the buy-in area shall execute a contract with the city including a provision that the buy-in charge, based upon the acreage of the property owned and established in this section, as amended, must either be placed on deposit with the city or paid in full prior to tapping of the six-inch water line. The contract shall also provide that the owner granted the right to tap the six-inch looped water line shall not be permitted to extend service from his tap of the six-inch looped water line to adjacent property owned by some other party or to property for which the buy-in charge has not been advanced and deposited with the city, without the prior written approval of the city first had and obtained. 
(d)  The buy-in charge provided in this section shall be a lien against any and all land located in the buy-in area until the applicable buy-in charges apportionable to the land have been paid in full. Once the buy-in charge becomes due, upon failure to pay the buy-in charge the City of Ardmore, Oklahoma, may begin foreclosure proceedings in the District Court of Carter County to collect the amount due together with a reasonable attorney fee and court costs. The lien shall run with the land. 
    Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars ($200.00). Each separate violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense. The municipal judge may levy costs up to ten dollars ($10.00) for any violation of this section, in addition to the before mentioned fine. 
(e)  Once the buy-in charge has been paid for a particular tract of land located in the buy-in area, then additional taps may be made on the six-inch water line at costs set out in the water department ordinances for irrigation, sprinkling, or swimming pool purposes on that particular tract of land only. No additional taps for these purposes may be issued for property on which the buy-in charge has not been paid in full. 
(f)  This section is to be recorded in the office of the County Clerk of Carter County, Oklahoma and indexed as to all property described herein located within the buy-in area.

Dilution of any waste discharged is prohibited, whether accomplished by the combination of two (2) or more waste streams or by the addition of other liquids solely for the purpose of diluting the quality of the waste discharge; 
(14)  Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes; 
(15)  Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the city manager in a wastewater discharge permit; 
(16)  Wastewater causing, either alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test; 
(17)  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; 
(18)  Fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in concentrations greater than 100 mg/l, and, if in the opinion of the city manager, it appears probable that such wastes: 
a.  Can deposit grease or oil in the sanitary sewer lines in such a manner as to clog the sanitary sewers. 
b.  Can overload the discharge's skimming and grease-handling equipment. 
c.  Are not amenable to biological oxidation and will therefore pass to the receiving waters without being affected by normal wastewater treatment process. 
d.  Can have deleterious effects on the treatment process due to the excessive quantities. 
(19)  Wastewater causing two readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, of more than twenty-five (25) per cent or any single reading over fifty (50) per cent of the lower explosive limit of the meter;

(a)  National categorical pretreatment standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated: 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the city manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the city manager shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(4)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(b)  State pretreatment standards. Pretreatment standards adopted by the State of Oklahoma in the Oklahoma Administrative Code 252:605 on file at the office of the Secretary of State are hereby incorporated and made a part of this article, and this article shall in all respects be construed in conformity therewith. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 2, 9-4-01) 
Sec. 30-91. - Local limits; right of revision. 
    The city will adopt the limits presented in the technically based local limits document as the general discharge limits. The city reserves the right to increase or decrease the limits allowed by permit. The limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The city manager may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of concentration-based limitations. Any person exceeding the conventional pollutant domestic levels of BOD 220 mg/1, COD 1,000 mg/1, TSS 220 mg/1, Ammonia 25 mg/1, Oil and Grease 100 mg/1 shall be subject to a surcharge. Surcharge rates shall be developed by the city manager and approved before the council.

(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the city manager, using the procedures prescribed in section 30-106 of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Control authority inspection and sampling of industrial users. 
    The city shall randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing compliance with pretreatment standards. Inspection and sampling of the effluent from each significant industrial user will be done at least once a year. 
(f)  Self-monitoring requirements for significant industrial users. 
(1)  Reports shall include results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and nature and concentration or production and mass, where requested by the city, of pollutants contained in the industrial wastewater discharge permit which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of the industrial user. When the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the user will not be required to submit the compliance certification required under §§403.12(b)(6) and 403.12(d). In addition, when the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
(2)  If results obtained by an industrial user in accordance with section 30-106 of this article indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
a.  The city performs the sampling at the industrial user's facility at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
b.  The city performs the sampling at the user's facility between the time when the user performs the initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(3)  The reports shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the reporting period. The city shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(4)  All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other approved test procedures. 
(5)  If an industrial user subject to reporting requirements monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the city, the results shall be included in the report. 
(6)  The city shall require appropriate reporting from those industrial users with discharges that are not subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
(g)  Certification and signatory requirements. 
    All reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 30-101(d) of this article. 
(h)  Reports of changed conditions. 
    Each user must notify the city manager of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change. 
(1)  The city manager may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 30-101(a) of this article. 
(2)  The city manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 30-101(e) of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 30-102(d) of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty (20) per cent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(i)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine or episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city manager of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city manager, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(j)  Reports from unpermitted users. 
    All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city manager, as the city manager may require. 
(k)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. 
    If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city manager within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the city manager monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city manager samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 6, 9-4-01; Ord. No. 2920, §§ 5, 6, 9-19-11) 
Sec. 30-105. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent that such information is known and readily available to the user: (1) an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, (2) an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and (3) an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 30-104(b) of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of division 6 of this article. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 6, 9-4-01) 
Sec. 30-106. - Analytical requirements; sample collection. 
(a)  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. The laboratories providing analytical services must be approved by the State of Oklahoma Laboratory Certification program for the specific pollutants required in the permit. 
(b)  Sample collection. 
(1)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director of public works. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized, the sampling must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the director of public works, as appropriate. 
(2)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsections (a) and (c) of this section, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director of public works may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by subsection (d) of this section, the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards will be required. 
(3)  Chain-of-Custody. As samples are collected in the field, they will be preserved as necessary, and labeled with the sample number, collector's name, date, time and method of sampling, sample site, preservative, container type, and analyses requested. Samples will then be placed on ice in a cooler for immediate transport to the City of Ardmore Central Laboratory or the wastewater treatment plant for pickup by a contract laboratory. A chain-of-custody form will be filled out, and will accompany the samples to the laboratory. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 6, 9-4-01; Ord. No. 2920, § 7, 9-19-11) 
Sec. 30-107. - Timing; record keeping. 
(a)  Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(b)  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained, pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, the name of the person(s) taking the samples, the dates analyses were performed, who performed the analyses, the analytical techniques or methods used, and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 6, 9-4-01) 
DIVISION 7. - COMPLIANCE MONITORING 

Sec. 30-108. - Right of entry. 
(a)  Inspection and sampling. The city manager, or his duly authorized agent bearing credentials and identification, shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the city manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the city manager will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The city manager shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The city manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy. These records must be retained according to section 30-107(b). 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city manager access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the city manager has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city, designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from the District Court of Carter County, State of Oklahoma, or the Municipal Court of Ardmore if authorized by law. 
(Ord. No. 2690, 7, 9-4-01) 
DIVISION 8. - ADMINISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES 

Sec. 30-109. - Confidential Information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city manager's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city manager, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but they shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the OPDES program, or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 8, 9-4-01) 
Sec. 30-110. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The city manager shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six (6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) per cent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit, or the average limit, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation that the city manager believes has caused, either alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment or has resulted in the city manager's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s) which the city manager determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 9, 9-4-01) 
Sec. 30-110.1. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The city manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to section 30-101.1 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The city manager may order a user that has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, nor prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative fines. 
(1)  When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of an amount, as approved by the courts each year, of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at the allowed interest by the court. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(3)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of the fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city manager may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(4)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, which threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the city manager, that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 30-110.1(h) of this article are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, either in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 110.1(c) and (h) this article. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in section 30-110.1(c) of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section 2 of this article. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 10.3 of this article as to why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city manager shall not be a bar to, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 10, 9-4-01) 
Sec. 30-110.2. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may petition the District Court of Carter County, State of Oklahoma, through the City of Ardmore's Attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The city manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The city manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal Prosecution. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day, imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or both. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a violation of this article and be punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day plus costs, be subject to imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders any inaccurate monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day plus costs, imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or both. 
(4)  In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day plus costs or imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or both. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The city manager may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city manager may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city manager is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 12, 9-4-01) 
Sec. 30-110.3. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(b)  Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the city manager. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the Section 1-4 of the Code of Ordinances and any other applicable sections governing nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. 
(c)  Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the city. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the city held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 2690, § 12, 9-4-01) 
Sec. 30-110.4. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3), below, are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred, and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the city manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset and filed a written report with the city manager within five (5) working days. The report shall contain the following: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
d.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
e.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
f.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 30-89(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in sections 30-89(b)(1)-30-89(b)(23) of this article, if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference, and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged, and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its OPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  1.  If a user knows, in advance, of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city manager at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
2.  A user shall submit oral notice to the city manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  1.  Bypass is prohibited, and the city manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this section. 
(2)  The city manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city manager determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (4)(1) of this section.

DIVISION 4. - USER CHARGE SYSTEM 

Sec. 30-143. - Sewer User Charges. 
    For the purpose of providing revenue for the operation, maintenance and construction of the sanitary sewer system of the City of Ardmore, Oklahoma, each respective user who discharges waste into the City's sanitary sewer system shall pay a sewer user charge based on the following schedule of rates. 
A.  1.  The following rates shall be effective beginning on the 1st day of July, 2017, and ending on the 30th day of June, 2018. 
Monthly Readiness to serve charge: 
Meter 
Size Monthly Readiness 
to Serve Charge Residential All $  7.38 Commercial/Industrial ?"-3/4"   7.38 1"  20.55 1 1/2"  38.05 2"  59.95 3"  149.45 4"  225.21 6" & Greater  307.86  
2.  An additional sewer user charge shall apply at the rate of three dollars and eight cents ($3.08) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water consumed for all residential, commercial, and industrial accounts. 
3.  For all nonindustrial or noncommercial users, the monthly wastewater contribution shall be determined from a percentage of water returned as wastewater, set at one hundred (100) per cent of the average water usage during months of November, December and January of the preceding year, as the water is measured by a water meter or meters of a type approved by the City, or as the wastewater contribution is otherwise currently established. The sewer rates will be adjusted according to the above formula on or about April 1 of each and every year. 
4.  For industrial and commercial users, the monthly waste water contribution shall be determined from a percentage of water returned as wastewater, set at ninety (90) per cent, unless wastewater volume is measured with an approved volume measuring device in the control manhole. 
5.  No charge is assessed for water meters installed for the exclusive use of lawn sprinklers, swimming pools, and other such related uses whereby water usage does not enter the sanitary sewerage system. 
6.  Each user of the City sanitary sewerage system who converts a substantial part of the water used into a manufactured project for sale, but does not return such part to the City sewerage system at the plant site, a deduction may be made of the part of water going into the manufactured product for the purpose of arriving at a sewer service charge. Such deductions shall be made only from approved meter furnished by the user and approved by the City Manager. 
7.  In the event a lot, parcel of land, premises, or facility discharging sewage industrial wastewater or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into the City's sewer system, or which ultimately enters the sewerage system, is supplied either in whole or in part, with water from wells, or any source other than the City water department, then such wells or other source of supply shall be registered with the City water department on or before January 1, 1984; and if the water from said wells or other supply is not measured by a water meter, the owner or occupant shall, at his cost, install and maintain a meter on said supplies in such a location and in such a manner as is satisfactory to the City water department. These meters shall serve as a basis for the establishment of the sewer user charge and shall be read monthly or bimonthly by the City meter readers. If, in the opinion of the city, the installation of a residential domestic meter would be impractical, water consumption will be estimated at one hundred (100) gallons per capita per day. 
8.  For nonresidential users of the City's sewage system, the City does not obligate itself to furnish sanitary sewer service unless it is reasonably within its financial ability to do so. 
9.  The City Manager shall have the authority to apply the prior year's average water usage in calculating a user's sewer rate where the user is a new customer who has not established a previous year's water usage and in other situations where equity would require it. 
10.  The City Manager shall have the authority to have the option to place certain commercial users on a residential sewer rate where those customers by their very nature have a seasonal water and sewer usage pattern similar to a residence. In no event, however, is this option to be made available to any commercial or industrial user who uses in excess of an average water usage of two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) gallons during the three-month period from November through January on which sewer rates are calculated. 
11.  The City Manager shall have the authority to allow an ice plant to be charged either at the commercial rate or the residential rate.

Sec. 30-143.5. - Surcharge for industrial users. 
(a)  Any wastewater discharged into the City of Ardmore sanitary sewer system which contains concentrations of conventional pollutants in excess of the allowable quantities as defined in section 30-89 shall be subject to a surcharge, in addition to any other sewer use charges. 
(b)  The industrial user's surcharge shall be calculated by the following formula: 
C s = [(B c (B) + S c (S) + O c (O) + D c (D) + A c (A)]V u 
Where: 
C s = Industrial user's monthly surcharge for wastewaters of excessive strength. B c = Operation and maintenance cost for treatment of one pound of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). B = Concentration of BOD in pounds per million gallons in excess of the allowable concentration. S c = Operation and maintenance cost for treatment of one pound of total suspended solids (TSS). S = Concentration of TSS in pounds per million gallons in excess of the allowable concentration. O c = Operation and maintenance cost for treatment of one pound of oil and grease. O = Concentration of oil and grease in pounds per million gallons in excess of the allowable concentration. D c = Operation and maintenance cost for treatment of one pound of chemical oxygen demand (COD). D = Concentration of COD in pounds per million gallons in excess of the allowable concentration. A c = Operation and maintenance cost for treatment of one pound of ammonia. A = Concentration of ammonia in pounds per million gallons in excess of the allowable concentration.  
Unit costs shall be calculated as follows: 
B c = C b /B t S c = C s /S t O c = C o /O t D c = C d /D t A c = C a /A t  
Where: 
C b = Portion of annual operation and maintenance cost of wastewater treatment plant attributable to BOD. C s = Portion of annual operation and maintenance cost of wastewater treatment plant attributable to TSS. C o = Portion of annual operation and maintenance cost of wastewater treatment plant attributable to oil and grease. C d = Portion of annual operation and maintenance cost of wastewater treatment plant attributable to COD. C a = Portion of annual operation and maintenance cost of wastewater treatment plant attributable to ammonia. B t = Annual total BOD loading to the wastewater treatment plant in pounds. S t = Annual total TSS loading to the wastewater treatment plant in pounds. O t = Annual total oil and grease loading to the wastewater treatment plant in pounds. D t = Annual total COD loading to the wastewater treatment plant in pounds. A t = Annual total ammonia loading to the wastewater treatment plant in pounds.  
(c)  An industrial user may, at his own cost, install an approved wastewater flow measuring device in an acceptable location, as provided for, to accurately measure wastewater flow for purposes of determining the monthly contribution of wastewater volume to the sanitary sewer system. Should an industrial user's wastewater flow be measured by a recording meter of a type approved by the city, and if such industrial user maintains such device in a proper condition to accurately measure such flow, then the industrial user's monthly wastewater contribution (V u ), in thousands of gallons, shall be that volume measured by the recording device. Should no measuring device be in use, a percentage of water consumption shall be the basis for estimating for estimating wastewater flows, such percentage of water returned as wastewater being determined by the city. When water is contained in a product or is evaporated, an application may be made for a reduction in the percentage of water returned as wastewater to the sanitary sewer system; provided that supporting data satisfactory to the city are furnished. These data shall include a flow diagram, destination of water supply or wastes, supported by metered data, from meters installed on such process piping at the expense of the private owner. 
(d)  The surcharge for BOD, TSS, oil and grease, COD, and ammonia shall be based upon the analyses required by section 30-105. The applicable surcharge determined by such tests shall be assessed and shall continue for twelve (12) months unless subsequent tests determine that the surcharge should be changed. 
(e)  The surcharge shall be calculated using the total annual operation and maintenance cost of the wastewater treatment plant, the annual loading rates of surchargeable pollutants at the wastewater treatment plant and percentage of costs required to remove one pound of each pollutant. The surcharge shall be recalculated every August following completion of the city's fiscal year. 
(f)  Billing shall be by the month, shall be shown as a separate item on the regular bill for water and sewer charges, and shall be paid monthly in accordance with existing practices.

Sec. 32-3. - Grant of authority; franchise required. 
(a)  In order to make cable services available to the residents of the city, the city may grant one (1) or more franchises in accordance with this article and the execution of a franchise agreement. 
(b)  No person may construct or operate a cable system in the city without a franchise granted by the city and having entered into a franchise agreement with the city. 
(c)  The city recognizes that, as of the effective date of this article, a question exists under Oklahoma law as to whether an election is required in order to grant or renew a franchise for cable service, or whether under applicable provisions of state and federal law, a permit to use city public Ways to provide cable service may be issued by the city upon proper application, without the necessity of an election. Unless or until an amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution is adopted, a valid statute is adopted by the Oklahoma legislature, or a final judgment is rendered by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, a federal district court, or other court with proper jurisdiction, which judgment is not subject to further appeal, requiring that an election be held in order for the city to grant a franchise for cable service, the city may grant a franchise pursuant to a permit without requiring such election.

(d)  At such time as a final judgment is rendered, which is not subject to further appeal, or a valid statute or constitutional amendment become effective, requiring the city to conduct an election as a condition to granting a franchise for cable service, then an election shall be held for that purpose.

(Ord. No. 2674, § I, 2-20-01) 
Sec. 32-04. - Franchise characteristics. 
(a)  A franchise shall be for a term or period of time not to exceed ten (10) years to serve all or specified areas of the city, and, in the event of a franchise being required, shall be in effect from and after approval thereof by a majority of the qualified electors at a special or general election, and upon the execution of a franchise agreement. A permit shall be effective upon the execution of an agreement as provided for herein. 
(b)  A franchise authorizes the franchisee to use the public ways within the city for installing cables, wires, lines, underground conduit and other facilities to operate a cable system within the city, but does not include any property of the city that is not dedicated to the city as public right-of-way, street, highway or alley, nor shall the right include any other city property in which the city has an interest. The franchise does not authorize such use on private property without the owners consent, nor does the franchise permit the use of privately owned easements without separate agreement of the owners. No reference to public right of way shall be deemed to be a representation that the city's interest or other rights in such property are sufficient to permit its use for the installation, maintenance, or operation of a cable system. In granting a franchise, the city grants to franchisee only those rights the city has an undisputed right and power to give or authorize. No rights shall pass to franchisee by implication. 
(c)  A franchise shall be nonexclusive, and will not preclude the issuance of another franchise, nor affect the city's right to authorize use of any public way by other persons as it deems appropriate. The granting of a franchise does not establish any priority for the use of the public way by any franchise holder. In the event of a dispute as to the use of the public way, the first priority shall be to the public generally, the second priority shall be to the city in the performance of its functions, and thereafter, between the authorized users of the public way as determined by the city. 
(d)  A franchise shall not relieve the franchisee of any requirement of any ordinance, rule, regulation or specification of the city now or hereinafter lawfully enacted by the city. The franchisee shall at all times be subject to the lawful exercise of the police power of the city to the full extent that such powers now or hereinafter may be vested in or granted to the city. However, any ordinance, rule, regulation or specification of the city enacted after a franchisee has entered into a franchise agreement shall not materially alter the rights or obligations of the franchisee under the existing ordinance and franchise agreement unless specifically authorized by state or federal law. 
(e)  A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with all laws of general applicability. 
(f)  The provisions of this article shall apply to a franchise agreement as if fully set out in such agreement. The terms of this article shall prevail over conflicting provisions of the franchise agreement unless the franchise agreement contains an explicit intent of waiver. 
(g)  The franchisee shall make cable service available to all residents and businesses within the city, subject to the requirements of section 32-16. 
(h)  The granting of a franchise shall not prevent the city from imposing conditions, including additional compensation should the franchisee want to provide service other than cable service.

The city reserves the right to reduce the franchise fee to a smaller percentage upon 60-days' notice to the franchisee. Likewise, the city reserves the right to restore the franchise Fee to a level not to exceed the maximum permitted upon further notice of sixty (60) days.

(b)  The franchise fee shall be payable to the city on a quarterly basis and shall be due no later than thirty (30) days after the end of the calendar quarter. 
(c)  In the event the franchise fee payment is not received by the city on the due date, the franchisee shall be assessed interest on any delinquency from the due date until paid in full at the rate of eighteen (18) per cent per annum.

(d)  The franchisee shall submit with each payment a detailed financial report showing the sources and amounts of gross revenues for the preceding quarter on which the franchise fee is determined. Additionally, franchisee shall submit to the city a self-audited annual revenue statement within three (3) months of the close of the fiscal year, setting forth the computation of gross revenues for the preceding year and a detailed explanation of the method of computation. The required reports shall be prepared at the expense of the franchisee on forms reasonably acceptable to the city and certified by the franchisee's chief financial officer or his designee. The same reports shall be due within ninety (90) days of the termination of the franchise. In the event of a bona fide dispute or question regarding the statement, the city may require such revenue statement to be verified by an independent auditor. 
(e)  Except as otherwise provided in the Cable Act and FCC regulations, all payments required by this section shall be in addition to all other fees and payments required to be made by franchisee to the city. 
(f)  Acceptance by the city of any payment shall not be construed as an accord or satisfaction that such payment is correct, nor shall acceptance be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums which may be due. 
(g)  The city shall have the right, at its cost and upon reasonable notice, to inspect and audit all books and records of the franchisee which may be necessary for the determination of gross revenues and computation of franchise fees due.

Chapter 33 - MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 33-1. - Legislative intent and purpose. 
(a)  The intent of this chapter is to ensure the health and safety of all Oklahomans and provide reasonable and orderly regulation of medical marijuana as authorized by the lawful passage of State Question 788. Only the powers enumerated under this chapter shall be proper. Any power not specifically enumerated is prohibited. 
(1)  Any person, persons, or entity violating any provisions of this article, either by doing anything which is prohibited or by failing to do anything which is commanded, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in an amount not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), plus court costs. Each separate violation of this article shall constitute a separate offense. Where a lesser fine is mandated by state law then the lesser amount of fine shall be applicable. 
(2)  The regulations are intended to apply to all medical marijuana for personal use or any medical marijuana business permitted under the State Question 788. The Code is intended to provide regulations to limit the impact that medical marijuana cultivation and production will have on health, safety, and community resources. 
(3)  Use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, and transportation of medical marijuana remains illegal under federal law and marijuana remains classified as a "controlled substance" by federal law. 
(4)  The regulations for medical marijuana uses are not adequate at the state level to address the impacts of medical marijuana on the city, making it appropriate for local regulation of the impacts of medical marijuana uses. 
(5)  Nothing in this chapter is intended to promote or condone the production, distribution, or possession of marijuana in violation of any applicable law. 
(6)  This chapter is to be construed to protect the public over medical marijuana business interests. Operation of a medical marijuana business is a revocable privilege and not a right in the city. There is no property right for an individual or business to have medical marijuana in the city. 
(7)  Medical marijuana is a heavily regulated industry in the city and all permittees are assumed to be fully aware of the law. The city shall not therefore be required to issue warnings before issuing citations for violations of this chapter. 
(b)  The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents and patients of the city by prescribing the manner in which medical marijuana businesses can be conducted in the city. Further, the purpose of this chapter is to: 
(1)  Provide for a means of cultivation, production, and distribution of marijuana to patients who qualify to obtain, possess, and use marijuana for medical purposes under the State Question 788. 
(2)  Protect public health and safety through reasonable limitations on business operations as they relate to noise, air and water quality, food safety, neighborhood and patient safety, security for the business and its personnel, and other health and safety concerns. 
(3)  Impose fees to cover the cost to the city of permitting medical marijuana businesses in an amount sufficient for the city to recover its costs of the permitting program. 
(4)  Adopt a mechanism for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(5)  Create regulations that address the particular needs of the patients and residents of the city and coordinate with laws that may be enacted by the state regarding the issue. 
(6)  Facilitate the implementation of State Question 788 without going beyond the authority granted by it. 
(7)  Issue medical marijuana business permits only to individuals and entities that have demonstrated an intent and ability to comply with this chapter without monitoring by city officials.

Nothing in this section shall grant to the city the power or jurisdiction to prosecute offenses that a city is not authorized to prosecute. Copies of the rules are on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(b)  Any crimes specified in the rules or other laws as felonies are specifically excluded from inclusion in this chapter. 
(c)  The penalty for a misdemeanor violation of the rules as adopted by this chapter shall be the maximum penalty allowed by state law but not exceeding the jurisdictional limits of the Ardmore Municipal Court.

SECTION 10. INSPECTION OF RECORDS

Notwithstanding the obligation herein, Grantee shall have the right to request the reasonable protection of proprietary information and to provide redacted documents or require Grantor or its agents to enter into such agreements pertaining to confidentiality as may reasonably protect the proprietary information of Grantee but which do not unreasonably frustrate the purposes of the subsection. 
SECTION 11. CONSIDERATION FOR FRANCHISE: FRANCHISE FEE 
A.  In consideration for the rights and privileges enjoyed under this franchise, Grantee agrees to pay Grantor as follows: 
(1)  Grantee shall pay Grantor a franchise fee the sum of which is equal to Three Percent (3%) of the Gross Receipts received by Grantee, per billing period, from the transportation, distribution, or sale of natural gas for domestic, commercial or industrial consumption within the corporate limits of the City of Ardmore. All sums due from Grantee shall be in lieu of all other franchise, license, or occupational taxes or fees, which may be levied or attempted to be levied on Grantee by the City. 
(2)  In the event that Grantor, pursuant to Section 3.B(1) of this ordinance, requires persons transporting gas pursuant to a Transportation Tariff Arrangement to pay compensation to Grantor for use of the public ways in connection the sale of Transport Gas, said compensation shall be calculated as a Volumetric Rate Fee for such Transport Gas, which shall be the sum equal to the then current Volumetric Rate multiplied by the number of Dth of Transport Gas reported or distributed through Grantee's facilities within the corporate city limits of the City by grantee or by any third-party to transport customers for consumption within the city. Grantee will in that event collect such Volumetric Rate Fees from persons transporting gas pursuant to a Transportation Tariff Arrangement and remit the same to Grantor. 
B.  In the event a customer of Grantee does not pay a monthly bill from Grantee in full, Grantee shall prorate its payments of remissions to the City for sums due on that particular bill so that the amount actually paid by the customer to Grantee on the bill is distributed to Grantee for the natural gas commodity and transportation or distribution service and to the City for sums due on the bill in proportion to the percentage of the total bill actually paid by the customer. In the event Grantee actually collects any outstanding amounts due on a past due, unpaid or partially paid monthly bill to a customer, then Grantee shall pay Grantor its proportionate share of sums due to the City on such bill. 
C.  Grantee's franchise fee based upon a percentage of gross cash receipts or a volumetric rate shall be payable monthly on or before the 25th day of each month, on its gross cash receipts of the preceding calendar month. 
D.  All sums due from Grantee under this Section shall be payable monthly on or before the 25th day of each month for the preceding calendar month, which sums shall be in lieu of all other franchise, license, or occupation taxes or fees, which may be levied or attempted to be levied on Grantee by the City. 
E.  The City Manager or his designee may waive the Volumetric Rate Fee or any part thereof due from a Transport Gas Consumer, but such waiver shall only be granted if: 
(1)  The Transport Gas Consumer could otherwise obtain its energy needs from another source that would not be subject to the fees imposed in subparagraph 2 of Section 11.A above and sufficient evidence is produced by Consumer so as to substantiate such alternative source; and 
(2)  Such alternative source, including all other fees, would be less than the cost of utilizing Grantee to furnish and transport the gas or transport alone, as the case may be. 
F.  Federal and State agencies, including state school districts, that are Transport Gas Consumers shall be exempt from the fee imposed under Section 11.A(2) on the value of Transport Gas. Grantor and Grantee shall collaborate as necessary to identify the exempt federal and state agencies. 
G.  Grantee shall update its records for the purpose of franchise fee payments as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving such notice. 
H.  In the event the accounting rendered to Grantor by Grantee is found to be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount, it being agreed that Grantor may accept amount offered by Grantee, but the acceptance thereof by Grantor shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or later found to be incorrect. Grantee shall have no obligation, however, to make payment upon Transport Gas for which Grantee has not been paid. Grantee shall provide notice to Grantor of such delinquent accounts within ninety (90) days and Grantor shall hold Grantee harmless from the cost or liability for the collection of franchise fees on such delinquent accounts. 
I.  Grantor agrees that the franchise fee percentage rate set forth in Section 11.A, at Subparagraphs (1) and (2), of this Ordinance shall in no event exceed the percentage rate hereafter approved to calculate any fee paid to Grantor by any other person or entity for use of the public ways if such fee or volumetric rate is based in any way on the amount of revenues or gross receipts from the transportation, distribution, or sale of natural gas or electric energy, excluding any municipally-owned electric utility, by such other person or entity to ultimate Consumers within the City. If at any time after the effective date of this Ordinance the fee or rate required to be paid by another is less than the percentage rate set forth in Subsections A (1) or (2) of Section 11, then the percentage rate set forth in Subsections A (1) or (2) of Section 11 of this Ordinance shall be reduced to equal such lesser percentage rate on the date such lesser percentage rate becomes effective and without any further action by the City or the qualified electors residing therein. 
SECTION 12. CONDITIONS OF FRANCHISE 
    This contract, franchise, grant and privilege is granted and accepted under and subject to all applicable laws and under and subject to all of the orders, rules, and regulations now or hereafter adopted by governmental bodies now or hereafter having jurisdiction. 
SECTION 13. INVALIDITY OF ORDINANCE 
    If any clause, sentence, or section of this Ordinance shall be held to be invalid, it shall not affect the remaining portions of this Ordinance, which shall remain valid and effective as if such invalid provision did not exist, although the parties shall be entitled to a judicial interpretation or construction of this Ordinance to address the validation of such provision by minimal amendment thereof. Further, should any governmental body now or hereafter having jurisdiction determine that Grantee shall not be permitted to collect in whole or in part the compensation due Grantor by others for Transport Gas as set forth in Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of Section 3 and Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of Section 11 of this Ordinance, Grantee shall thereafter have no obligation to make such payment to Grantor and Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of Section 3 and Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of Section 11 shall be of no force and effect.

SECTION 18. NONEXCLUSIVITY. 
    Neither the granting of this franchise, nor any of the provisions contained herein, shall be construed to prevent the city from granting an identical, or similar, franchise to any person or corporation other than the franchisee. 
SECTION 19. SEPARABILITY. 
    If any section, subsection, clause, phrase or portion of this franchise, is for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional by any governmental agency or court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.

    In the event that this ordinance fails to receive approval of the electorate, then the terms and provisions of the existing ordinances relative to cable television shall remain in force. This ordinance may be amended or changed upon such terms, conditions and considerations as may be mutually agreed upon between the commission and the franchisee.

    That an emergency exists for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety and welfare, by reason whereof this ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its passage by the commission and its approval by the electorate.

Editor's note- Appendix C contains Ord. No. 2583, adopted July 20, 1998. Said ordinance is set out herein as enacted, including arrangement and numbering. Absence of a history note following a particular section or subsection in App. C indicates that such section or subsection derives unchanged from Ord. No. 2583; conversely, a history note enclosed in parentheses following a particular section or subsection indicates amendment by the ordinance or ordinances included in such history note. 
Further, Ord. No. 2583, repealed Zoning Ordinance No. 1701, adopted March 3, 1973, which had been codified as App. C. The user is directed to the Code Comparative Table located at the back of this volume for the history of the amendatory ordinances to Ord. No. 1701. 

Chapter 1. - General Provisions 

Sec. 101 - Title 
    This ordinance shall be known as the "Unified Development Code" or "UDC" of the City of Ardmore, Carter County, Oklahoma, and shall consist of this text as well as the Official Zoning Map on file in the office of the City Clerk. 
Sec. 102 - Authority 
    This UDC is adopted in accordance with the authority granted the City under Ok. Rev. Statutes Title 11, Chapter 1, Articles 41 through 45, relating generally to Building and Zoning, and including, without limitation, provisions for platting, the regulation of subdivisions, planning, zoning, variances and appeals, regulation of planned unit developments, site plan review, historic preservation, and the creation of planning commissions and boards of adjustment. It is the intent of the City Commission in adopting this Code to exercise as fully as possible the authority granted by all of the separate sections of all of those articles and to do so in a comprehensive, integrated and cohesive code. 
Sec. 103 - Purpose and Intent 
    This UDC classifies and regulates the use of land, buildings and structures within the city limits of the City of Ardmore. The regulations contained here are necessary to promote the health, safety, convenience and welfare of the City's inhabitants by dividing the city into districts and regulating therein the use of the land and the use and size of buildings as to height and number of stories, the coverage of land by buildings, the size of yards and open space, density of population and location of buildings. 
Sec. 104 - Right-to-Farm and Ranch Policy 
    In addition to the purposes set out above, Ardmore hereby establishes a "Right-to-Farm and Ranch" policy. See also Sec. 1007. 
1.  Any agricultural operation or practice that is historical, traditional, legitimate and reasonable shall be protected. Any new or expanded agricultural operation or practice that is legitimate and reasonable shall be encouraged. 
2.  Agriculture, as a way of life, benefits all residents of Ardmore. It is an important part of the economy and adds intrinsic value to life in Ardmore. Agriculture, as a business, brings with it noise, odors, dust, mud, smoke and other inconveniences such as weed burning, equipment and livestock on public roads, odors from manure and feeds, odors from chemical applications, lights and noises at all hours of the day and night, and on-farm processing and marketing of crops and livestock. To maintain this way of life, Ardmore intends to protect agricultural operators from unnecessary, intrusive litigation. Therefore, no inconvenience shall be considered a nuisance as long as it occurs as a part of non-negligent and legal agricultural practice. 
Sec. 105 - All Development 
    Except as provided in this UDC, no land shall be used and no building, structure or improvement shall be made, erected, constructed, moved, altered, enlarged or rebuilt which is designed, arranged or intended to be used or maintained for any purpose or in any manner except in accordance with the requirements established in the district in which such land, building, structure or improvement is located, and in accordance with the provisions of this UDC relating to any or all districts. 
Sec. 106 - Applicability and Jurisdiction 
    The regulations of this UDC apply to all land within the corporate limits of the City of Ardmore. 
Sec. 107 - Minimum Requirements 
    In the interpretation and application of this UDC, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
Sec. 108 - Effective Date 
    The effective date of this UDC shall be August 1, 1998. 
Sec. 109 - Conflicting Provisions 
A.  Conflict with State or Federal Regulations. If the provisions of this UDC are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government, the more restrictive provision shall control, to the extent permitted by law. 
B.  Conflict with Other City Regulations. If the provisions of this UDC are inconsistent with one another, or if they conflict with provisions found in other adopted ordinances or regulations of the City, the more restrictive provision shall control. 
C.  Conflict with Private Restrictions. It is not the intent of this UDC to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easement, covenant, deed restriction or other agreement between private parties. If the provisions of this UDC impose a greater restriction than imposed by a private agreement, the provisions of this UDC shall control. Where the provisions of a private agreement impose a greater restriction than this UDC, the provisions of the private agreement shall control. 
Sec. 110 - Transitional Provisions 
A.  Violations Continue. Any violation of the previous zoning or subdivision regulations of the City shall continue to be a violation under this UDC and be subject to penalties and enforcement under Chapter 10, unless the use, construction or activity complies with the provisions of this UDC. 
B.  Nonconformities Under Previous Code. Any nonconformity under the previous zoning regulations of the City will also be a legal nonconformity under this UDC, as long as the situation that resulted in the nonconforming status under the previous regulations continues to exist. If, however, a nonconforming situation under the previous regulations becomes conforming because of the adoption of this UDC, or any subsequent amendment to it, then the situation will no longer be a nonconformity. 
C.  Permit Issued Before Effective Date. 
1.  Any building or development for which a permit was issued before the effective date of this UDC may be completed in conformance with the issued permit and other applicable permits and conditions, even if such building or development does not fully comply with provisions of this UDC. 
2.  If construction is not commenced or completed according to the applicable permit terms, the City Commission may, for good cause shown, grant an extension of up to 6 months for such construction. If the building is not completed within the time allowed under the original permit or any extension granted, then the building may be constructed, completed or occupied only in compliance with this UDC. 
D.  Plat Approved Before Effective Date. 
1.  Any lot shown on a subdivision plat approved by the City of Ardmore under any prior subdivision ordinance shall be deemed to be fully conforming with this UDC as to lot area and access. 
2.  Any site other than a lot described under paragraph 1 above that meets both of the following criteria shall be deemed fully conforming with this UDC as to lot area and access: 
a.  The site consists of all or part of one or more lots shown on a subdivision plat approved by the City of Ardmore under any prior subdivision ordinance; and 
b.  The site conformed with the zoning ordinance at the time that it was created, or it conforms with the requirements of this UDC. 
3.  Any subdivision for which a preliminary or final plat was approved before the effective date of this UDC may be completed according to the approved plat and other applicable permits and conditions, even if the subdivision does not fully comply with the provisions of this land development code. 
4.  If the subdivision is not completed within the time requirements established by prior code or within any schedule included in the approval of the plat, the City Commission may grant one extension of time for the completion of the subdivision. If the subdivision is not completed within the time required under the original approval or any extension granted, then the subdivision may be completed only in compliance with this UDC. 
E.  PUD Approved Before Effective Date. Any PUD for which a final plat has been approved by the City Commission is considered legal, and shall continue to be governed by the specific ordinance and site plan previously adopted by the Planning Commission and City Commission. Any amendments, revisions or changes to previously adopted PUD's shall comply with provisions of this UDC. 
F.  Previous Approval Under (C-7) Designation. Development approved subject to the C-7, Conditional Commercial designation prior to the effective date of this UDC shall be converted to conditional use designation. Any special restrictions shall continue in full force and effect as adopted as conditions. Further amendments or modifications shall follow the procedures of Sec. 314.

Sec. 312 - Variance 
A.  Applicability. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to grant variances from the zoning district dimensional standards and off-street parking and loading standards of this UDC that will not be contrary to the public interest or the spirit of this UDC where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this UDC would result in unnecessary physical (not economic) hardship to the property owner. 
B.  Application. An application for a Variance shall be submitted to the Planning Director, along with such accompanying material as is required to ensure compliance with the criteria in subsection D. below. Application procedures are described in Section 301 and include notification of owners of property within 300 feet.

D.  Review Criteria. A variance may be granted by the Board of Adjustment upon an affirmative finding that all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  The requested variance arises from conditions that are unique to the subject property, that are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district and that are not a result of the owner's intentional action; 
2.  The granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents; 
3.  The strict application of the applicable standards will constitute an unnecessary physical hardship (not economic hardship) because the property cannot be used for an otherwise allowed use without coming into conflict with applicable site development standards;

G.  Variance Affecting Rights-of-Way Prohibited. The Board of Adjustment may not grant a variance that will have the effect of allowing a use or structure to extend into a public right-of-way or easement. 
H.  Conditions of Approval. In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment may impose such conditions, safeguards and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by the variance as may be necessary to reduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of the variance upon other property in the area. A copy of the Board's letter of conditional approval shall be filed with the deed records at the County. 
I.  Expiration and Lapse of Approval. Property owners shall have 6 months from the date of approval of a Variance to secure any necessary permits to carry out the proposed improvements. If permits have not been obtained within 6 months of the date of Variance approval, the approved Variance shall lapse.

No building or fence permit shall be issued by the Building Official for any historic structure or site located within the HP District or any individually designated structure until the application for such permit has been reviewed by the Historic Preservation Board and a Certificate of Appropriateness has been approved by the Historic Preservation Board. 
2.  Procedures. 
a.  To apply for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the applicant shall apply to the Building Official for a building permit, furnishing two copies of such plans, elevations, perspectives and specifications as required by a building permit, together with such other materials as may be required on an application form furnished by the Historic Preservation Board. The Building Inspector shall forward to the Historic Preservation Board the application for a building permit. 
b.  The secretary to the Historic Preservation Board shall inform the applicant of the meeting date at which the application shall be considered. The applicant shall have the right to be heard and may be accompanied or represented by counsel and/or one or more construction or design professionals at the meeting. 
c.  After hearing the applicant, and any recommendations from the Planning Director, the Historic Preservation Board shall take one of the following actions: 
(i)  Approve the proposed work and issue a certificate of appropriateness for it; 
(ii)  Approve the proposed work with conditions and issue a conditional certificate of appropriateness for it; or 
(iii)  Deny the certificate of appropriateness. 
d.  Applications received by 5:00 p.m. the day after the Historic Preservation Board meeting held on the second Tuesday of each month will be considered by the Board at their next monthly meeting. If the Board fails to consider and act on the application within 45 days after such meeting, the application shall be deemed approved and the Building Official shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness noting the "deemed approval" on it. 
e.  In the case of the disapproval of plans by the Historic Preservation Board, the Board shall state in writing the reasons for such disapproval and may include suggestions in regard to actions the applicant might take to secure the approval of the Board concerning future issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
f.  Work performed pursuant to the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate, if any. It shall be the duty of the Building Official to inspect from time to time any work performed pursuant to a Certificate of Appropriateness to assure such compliance. In the event that such work is not in compliance, the building inspector shall issue a stop work order and/or citation as prescribed by ordinance. The Historic Preservation Board may request by resolution that the building inspector inspect the work and issue a stop work order. 
3.  Certificate. It shall be the responsibility of the Building Official to issue the actual Certificate of Appropriateness, with any designated conditions, and to maintain a copy of the Certificate of Appropriateness, together with the proposed plans. These shall be public documents for all purposes. 
4.  Criteria. The Historic Preservation Board shall determine whether to grant a certificate of appropriateness based on the following criteria: 
a.  Consistency of the proposed work with the regulations of the applicable HP District or individual structure designation; 
b.  Consistency of the proposed work with the regulations of the underlying zoning district; 
c.  Consistency of the proposed work with the findings adopted by the City Commission in designating the applicable HP District or individual structure designation; 
d.  For a historic structure, consistency of the proposed work with the findings adopted by the Historic Preservation Board in designating it a historic structure, or comparable record of findings from a state or federal listing; and 
e.  Other objective evidence regarding the consistency of the proposed work with the purposes of the city in adopting this ordinance and, more specifically, with the preservation of an identified historic structure or other resource. 
5.  Guidelines. The Historic Preservation Board shall use the Secretary of the Interior's pamphlet entitled, "Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings" as guidelines. 
a.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose. 
b.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and is environment should not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
c.  All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historic basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
d.  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
e.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
f.  Deteriorated architectural features which are to be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
g.  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building material shall not be undertaken without approval from the Historic Preservation Board. 
h.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to any project. 
i.  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historic, architectural, or cultural material and when such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, a character of the property, neighborhood or environment. Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to a structure shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
6.  Supplemental Guidelines. The Historic Preservation Board shall develop such supplemental guidelines as it may find necessary to implement the regulations of a particular HP District or the findings applicable to the designation of a historic structure or a particular HP District. Such guidelines may include the following: 
a.  Charts of acceptable colors; 
b.  Charts or samples of acceptable materials for siding, foundations, roofs or other parts of buildings; 
c.  Illustrations of appropriate architectural details; 
d.  Numerical specifications of appropriate rhythms or proportions; 
e.  Numerical specifications of appropriate relationships to streets, sidewalks, other structures and buildings; 
f.  Illustrations of appropriate porch treatments or entrances; 
g.  Illustrations of appropriate signage or street furniture. 
K.  Certificate of Economic Hardship. 
1.  Application. Application on forms prescribed by the Historic Preservation Board for a Certificate of Economic Hardship may be made by an owner or his agent who has been denied a certificate of appropriateness for any work specified. 
2.  General Provisions and Procedures. The Historic Preservation Board may require that the applicant for a certificate of economic hardship submit any or all of the following information before it makes a determination on the application. 
a.  An estimate of the costs of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or removal and an estimate of any additional costs that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations of the Historic Preservation Board for changes necessary for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. 
b.  A report from a licensed engineer or architect with experience in rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any structures on the property and their suitability for rehabilitation. 
c.  The estimated market value of the property in its current condition; (1) after completion of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or removal; (2) after any changes recommended by Historic Preservation Board and, in the case of a proposed demolition, after reconstruction of the existing property for continued use. 
d.  In the case of proposed demolition, an estimate from an architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility or rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure on the property. 
e.  Any other reasonable information which may make the Historic Preservation Board's determination economically sound. 
3.  Hearing Required. After the application for certificate of economic hardship has been submitted, the Historic Preservation Board shall hold a hearing at which the applicant, neighboring property owners, preservation organizations, or others with a demonstrated interest in the subject matter, may testify concerning economic hardship. 
4.  Determination of Economic Hardship. The Historic Preservation Board shall review all the evidence and information required of any applicant for a certificate of economic hardship and make a determination within 45 days of receipt of the application whether the denial of a certificate of appropriateness has deprived, or will deprive, the owner of the property of reasonable use of, or economic return on, the property. If the Historic Preservation Board denies such a certificate of economic hardship, the applicant may proceed with the proposed work only in accordance with a duly approved certificate of appropriateness. 
L.  Demolition. 
1.  No structure or tract within any Historic Preservation District shall be demolished or removed unless such demolition shall be approved by the Historic Preservation Board and a certificate of appropriateness for such demolition shall be granted. The procedure for issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition shall be the same as for the issuance of other certificates of appropriateness with the following modifications: 
a.  After the hearing, the Historic Preservation Board may approve the Certificate of Appropriateness thereby authorizing the demolition, or the Historic Preservation Board may deny the Certificate of Appropriateness and postpone the demolition or removal for a period not to exceed 120 days. The purpose of such a postponement would be to allow the Board and any interested parties to explore alternatives to demolition. 
b.  At the conclusion of any such period of postponement, the Historic Preservation Board within 30 days thereafter shall hold a second hearing for the purpose of considering whether or not the demolition or removal will be allowed. If disallowed, then an appeal may be made to the City Commission in accordance with appeal procedures set out in this UDC. 
c.  Within 60 days, the City Commission may deny or approve the demolition, or may enter an order postponing the demolition for an additional period not to exceed 120 days from the date of such order. The purpose of such a postponement would be to allow the City Commission and any interested parties to explore alternatives to demolition. At the conclusion of this final period of postponement, the Planning Director shall issue a permit approving the demolition. 
2.  Supplemental Criteria. In determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition, the Historic Preservation Board, and, on appeal, the City Commission, shall consider the following criteria, in addition to the criteria specified above. 
a.  The uniqueness of the structure as a representative type of style of architecture, historic association or other element of the original designation criteria applicable to such structure or tract. 
b.  The condition of the structure from the standpoint of structural integrity and the extent of work necessary to stabilize the structure. 
c.  The economically viable alternatives available to the demolition applicant, including: 
(i)  Donation of a part of the value of the subject structure or site to a public or nonprofit agency, including the conveyance of development rights and facade easement. 
(ii)  The possibility of sale of the structure or site, or any part thereof, to a prospective purchaser capable of preserving such structure or site. 
(iii)  The potential of such structure or site for renovation and its potential for continuing use. 
(iv)  The potential of the subject structure or site for rezoning in an effort to render such property more compatible with the physical potential of the structure. The ability of the subject structure or site to produce a reasonable economic return on investment for its owner, provided however, that it is specifically intended that this factor shall not have exclusive control and effect, but shall be considered along with all other criteria contained in this section. 
M.  Minimum Maintenance. 
1.  Every person in charge of an improvement on a designated historic structure or in an historic district shall keep in good repair (1) all of the exterior portions of such improvement and (2) all interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause or tend to cause the exterior portions of such improvement to deteriorate, decay or become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair. 
2.  The provisions of this section shall be in addition to all other provisions of law requiring any such improvement to be kept in good repair. 
3.  The Historic Preservation Board may enforce the provisions of this section at law or at equity. 
N.  Taxes. Nothing in this section shall be construed as reason for an increased evaluation of property for purposes of ad valorem taxation because of historic designation. 
O.  Property Owned by Public Agencies. The requirements, provisions, and purposes of this article apply to all property owned by the City or any other public agency; provided, however, designation pursuant to this section shall not affect the validity of prior actions of the City Commission approving plans, programs, or authorizations for public trust, agencies or authorities of the City without an express amendment of such plan, program or authority.

E.  Review Criteria. 
1.  Zoning district designations should give consideration to their impacts upon adjacent property and existing land uses. 
2.  Transportation access and vehicular traffic generated must be considered when determining the most appropriate zoning district designation. 
3.  Downzoning to a less intensive use might be recommended in certain areas where the character of development has already changed or will change over time giving consideration to the existing zoning district classification and resulting permitted land uses which have been in effect for 20 years. 
4.  Industrial uses should be concentrated along major arterial roadways and the railroad to afford proper access and minimize traffic, noise, and visual impacts. 
5.  Major commercial uses should be concentrated along the Commerce Street corridor, along the Interstate 35 corridor, and within the downtown central business district. Efforts should be taken to avoid stripping many of the arterial and collector streets with commercial land uses and zoning because of the resulting high number of curb access points, traffic safety concerns, pedestrian conflict points, and potential land use conflicts with adjacent properties to the rear of commercial uses. 
6.  Office uses should be concentrated around the downtown central business district, along major collector and arterial streets, near the hospital and medical complex, and as a transition use or buffer between residential uses and nearby commercial or industrial uses. 
7.  Multifamily uses should be located in a variety of areas around Ardmore, should be provided with good street access, and should be used as a potential transition or buffer use between single family residential uses and nearby commercial, office or industrial uses, or major transportation corridors. 
8.  Public schools and parks should be located, where practical and economically feasible, near the clients served and with consideration given to both vehicular and pedestrian access. 
9.  Agricultural land uses should be located at the edge or fringe areas of Ardmore so potential land use conflicts can be minimized and so agricultural and other associated uses can be protected from encroaching urban uses. 
10.  High impact uses that create large amounts of noise, odor, traffic, or other forms of identified and verified nuisances on residential land uses should be located as far as possible from residential neighborhoods or, as an alternative, positive measures must be taken to mitigate negative impacts on nearby neighborhoods. 
11.  Commercial and industrial land uses, when located along major transportation entrance corridors to Ardmore, shall give care and concern for appearance, design, visual impact and traffic safety. 
12.  Spot zoning, the zoning of a small individual parcel of land different from the majority of other zoning district classifications in the surrounding area, shall generally be discouraged, but may be used as a buffer zone or for public benefit. 
13.  Single family residential land uses should include small lots, medium sized lots, and provisions for large estate type lots, and all primary residential uses within neighborhoods should back or side onto arterial streets in order to encourage quiet, safe, and low-volume localized traffic movements. 
14.  Higher intensity land uses should be strategically placed and developed with design features that utilize increased setbacks, landscaping, berms, fencing, buffering uses, and other separations to be compatible with low intensity development. 
15.  Large community-serving shopping areas, major retail and service activities should be located at the intersection of arterial or collector streets. 
16.  In addition to the above outlined policies used for zoning district designations, there are certain sensitive development corridors and areas which must undergo further planning study as development pressures increase and as applications are received for either annexation, rezoning and subdivision actions. These sensitive corridors and areas include: 
a.  The north and south Interstate 35 corridor; 
b.  The east Highway 199 corridor; 
c.  The proposed northwest and southwest arterial transportation loop system connecting Prairie Valley Road to Fox Den Rd. and U.S. Highway 70 from Hedges Road to Fox Den Rd.; 
d.  The proposed P Street Southeast arterial corridor from U.S. 70 north to Sam Noble Parkway; 
e.  The Downtown Executive Airport and adjacent land south of Lake Murray Drive corridor and nearby Oklahoma State Park lands; 
f.  U.S. Highway 70 as it traverses the City from east to west; 
g.  The 12th Street NW corridor; and 
h.  The North Rockford Road corridor from Broadway to Veterans Boulevard. 
F.  Successive Applications. If the City Commission denies an application for a map amendment, an application for the same or any more intensive district on any portion of the subject tract may not be refilled for a period of one year from the date of the City Commission public hearing on the proposed amendment. 
G.  Concurrent Amendment of Future Land Use Map. The City Commission may process a concurrent amendment to the Future Land Use Map of the Comprehensive Plan, provided that at least one of the following criteria has been met: 
1.  Changed projections from those on which the boundary was based (for example, regarding public services of the extension of utilities); 
2.  Changed assumptions (for example, regarding demographic trends); 
3.  New issues not recognized in the Comprehensive Plan; 
4.  Recognition of a need for additional detail or comprehensiveness; or 
5.  Data, typographical or drafting errors.

(Ord. No. 2723, 8-19-02) 
Sec. 402 - Official Zoning District Map 
    The boundaries of the zoning districts established by this UDC are shown on a map or series of maps designated the "Official Zoning Map, " which is part of this UDC as fully as if it were set out in this Chapter in detail. Original copies of the Official Zoning Map are maintained in the office of the City Clerk. 
Sec. 403 - Interpretation of District Boundaries 
    Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map accompanying and made a part of this UDC, the following rules shall apply: 
1.  In cases where a boundary line is given a position adjoining, coincident with, or within a street or alley or non-navigable stream, it shall be deemed to be in the center of the street, alley or stream, and if the actual location of such street, alley or stream varies slightly from the location as shown on the district map, then the actual location shall control. 
2.  In cases where a boundary line is shown as being located a specific distance from a street line or other physical feature, this distance shall control. 
3.  In cases where a boundary line is shown adjoining or coincident with a railroad, it shall be deemed to be in the center of the railroad right-of-way and distances measured from a railroad shall be measured from the center of the designated mainline track. 
4.  Where the district boundary lines are not otherwise indicated, and where the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the district boundaries shall be considered to be the lot lines, and where the districts designated on the Official Zoning Map are bounded approximately by lot lines, said lot lines shall be considered to be the boundary of such districts unless said boundaries are otherwise indicated on the map or by ordinance. 
5.  In unsubdivided property, unless otherwise indicated, the district boundary line on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the use of the scale contained on such map. 
6.  Boundary lines indicated as approximately following City Limits shall be considered to follow the City Limits. 
7.  All water areas within the City Limits are considered to be within a zoning district and controlled by applicable district regulations. District boundary lines over water areas are located by noted and scaled dimensions, by relation to physical features, by coincidence with the City Limit line, or by a straight line projection of the centerlines of streets as indicated on the district maps. Straight line district boundaries over water areas shall be assumed to continue as straight line until they intersect with each other or with the City Limit line. 
8.  Boundary lines indicated as following shorelines shall be considered to follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline, shall be considered as moving with the actual shoreline. 
9.  Where existing physical or natural features contradict those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in case any other uncertainty exists, the location of district boundaries shall be determined by the Planning Director in accordance with the provisions in Sec. 303. 
Sec. 404 - Zoning Upon Annexation 
    All new additions and annexations of land to the City of Ardmore shall be zoned AG, Agricultural District unless otherwise classified by the City Commission at the time of annexation. Rezoning of annexed lands shall follow the procedures and requirements for rezoning of all other lands within the City as set forth in Sec. 319. 
Sec. 405 - AG, Agricultural District Intent Statement 
    This district is intended to provide an area primarily for agricultural uses or the extraction of the various products such as oil, minerals, rock and gravel from the earth on parcels 20 acres or more in size. It is the purpose of this district to protect such uses from urban development so long as the land in the district is devoted primarily to agriculture or extraction of minerals. This district is intended to preserve the rural, agricultural nature of the area, while providing for low-density development that will require minimal public improvements and services. Residential tracts are permitted, but public sewer and fire protection may not be provided although public water may be available. Water wells may be permitted subject to review by the State Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and the City Public Works Department. Sewage lagoons shall not be considered an acceptable form of sewage disposal within the City limits. 
(Ord. No. 2723, 8-19-02) 
Sec. 406 - Residential District Intent Statements 
    Regulations for the residential districts are designed to protect the residential character of areas so designated from the noise, congestion and heavy traffic of commercial and industrial activities. The regulations are also designed to encourage a suitable environment for family life by providing for openness of living areas and permitted appropriate neighborhood facilities and compatible community facilities. Sewage lagoons shall not be considered an acceptable form of sewage disposal within the City limits. 
A.  RR, Rural Residential District. This district is intended to provide for land situated on the fringe of the urban area that is undergoing urbanization in acreage tracts or that is being platted into rural residential developments with lot sizes of 5 acres or more.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2905, adopted Sept. 20, 2010, amended App. C, § 411 title to read as herein set out. Former App. C, § 411 title pertained to MHP, mobile home/travel trailer/RV park district. 
Sec. 412 - PUD, Planned Unit Development District 
A.  Purpose. The Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is intended to implement the Comprehensive Plan's objective of having "Mixed Use Development" in areas located along major traffic routes where large tracts of land exist. The Future Land Use Plan identifies "Mixed Use" areas. Planned developments can integrate various residential, commercial or industrial uses while ensuring substantial compliance with the Comprehensive Plan's Goals and Objectives and the UDC regulations. 
    The PUD District regulations are designed to provide for small and large scale developments incorporating a single type or a variety of residential, commercial, industrial and related uses which are planned and developed as a unit. Private or public common land and open space is an essential element of the development that is related to and affects the long term value of the development. A planned unit development shall be a separate entity with a distinct character that respects and harmonizes with surrounding development. 
B.  Permitted Uses. In order to increase creativity and flexibility in the development of areas suitable for a planned unit development, there are no specifically prescribed uses which are permitted within the boundaries of a PUD. The developer shall be responsible for preparation of a list of permitted uses within the specific PUD requested. The development of the list of uses shall take into account the nature and purpose of the PUD area, and such uses and locations shall be appropriate in order to protect and be in harmony with surrounding development. 
    A specific written list of uses to be "permitted by right" shall be submitted for review and approval by the Planning Commission and City Commission. Following approval by the Planning Commission and City Commission, the list of specific uses permitted by right shall serve as the control list in issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy. 
    Any changes in the PUD, including changes in the list of permissible uses, must be made under the procedures that are applicable to the initial approval of a PUD project. 
C.  Ownership Control. The approved PUD District and final development plan shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the land until revised or rezoned. 
D.  Minimum District Area. Eligible properties must be 2 acres or larger in size. 
1.  The residential density of all Planned Unit Developments (PUD) shall conform to density guidelines of the underlying zoning district of the property. 
E.  Parking and Off-Street Loading. All uses established within a PUD shall comply with the off-street parking, loading, and related landscaping provisions contained in Sec. 708. However, the requirements for individual structures or lots may be met through either provision of adequate parking on the lot on which a structure is so located, or upon adjacent property that is under the control of a property owner or association to which said lot is an automatic participant. In no case, however, shall the cumulative requirements for all parking and off-street loading requirements be less than if said uses were individually established and located in any other zoning district within the City. 
F.  Street and Infrastructure Requirements. All streets, utilities, and other infrastructure requirements shall be built to current City standards, or the developer shall have the burden of showing that any variance from those standards will be both a benefit to the neighborhood and to the general public. 
G.  Perimeter Requirements. In order to assure compatibility with surrounding development, the developer shall submit specific information as to the setbacks, building height, lot coverage factors and other elements necessary for all perimeter lots that are adjacent to the boundary of the PUD District, or adjacent to any boundary or perimeter street right-of-way. While no specific setback requirements are herein established, the Planning Commission shall consider the nature, extent and character of the adjacent development and shall take into consideration the types of area regulations applicable to those adjacent properties. 
H.  Open Space and Landscaping Requirements. Common or private open space constitutes an essential ingredient in a PUD and is one of the most basic and important design elements. Open space should be distributed more or less equitably throughout the PUD district in relationship to the dwelling units and other use areas that are intended to be served by the common or private open space. Adequate guarantees must be provided that the common or private open space areas are preserved and maintained for those purposes only. A property owners' association shall be required if other arrangements satisfactory to the City have not been made for improving, operating and maintaining all such common or private open space areas, and other communally owned facilities. Open space shall be evaluated utilizing the following general guidelines: 
1.  A minimum of 20 per cent of the gross acreage of any residential PUD shall be designated as common or private open space; 
2.  No more than one-half of the common or private open space may be covered by water; 
3.  Recreation facilities or structures and their accessory uses located in common areas shall be considered as usable open space as long as the total impervious surfaces such as paving and roofs constitute no more than 10 per cent of the total open space; and 
4.  A minimum of 10 per cent of the gross area of the nonresidential components of any PUD's open space shall be designated as landscaped open space. Streets and parking shall not be considered as open space. 
I.  Landscaping for Nonresidential and Multifamily Sites. Landscaping shall be required as part of each PUD, and shall be completed prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy or final building inspection or within 180 days of that date with the approval of the Planning Director and satisfactory assurance that the landscaping will be completed unless seasonal weather conditions require additional time for planting. 
1.  A minimum of 10 per cent of the gross lot area shall be landscaped. One-half of the minimum shall be located in the front yard. Required landscape area shall not include driveways, rights-of-way or easements for streets or alleys. Fences and walls may be located in the required landscape area.

c.  A landscaped earth berm, the top of which is at least 21/2 feet higher than the elevation of the adjacent residential property. The slope of the berm shall not exceed 33 per cent (3:1). If the berm is less than 6 feet in height, it must be planted with a dense evergreen hedge, along with grass, sod or ground cover such that the combined height is 6 feet. The total combined height shall equal 6 feet along all property lines adjacent to the residential district, except required sight triangles. 
d.  Any combination of landscaped earth berm as described above, and ornamental fence or wall, provided the total combined height equals 6 feet along all property lines adjacent to the residential district, except required sight triangles. A ground mounted sign shall not suffice as part of a fence/wall. 

Parking Lot Buffers and Landscaping 
2.  The front yard and exterior side yard areas of the lot in which a parking lot is located shall include a landscaped area adjacent to the parking area. Said landscaped area shall be maintained in good condition. Parking areas that are not visible from a public street shall be excluded these requirements.

3.  Front Setbacks. When new multi-family or nonresidential development occurs on lots adjacent to the side lot line of any protected lot, the new development shall observe the same minimum front setback that applies to the protected lot for a distance of 50 feet from the protected lot. In all cases, no buildings, parking spaces, loading spaces or dumpsters may be located within the required setback. 
E.  Visual Screening of Dumpsters. Dumpsters located on property subject to these residential protection standards must be completely screened from view from a public way or any protected lot by buildings, fences, walls, berms or landscape buffers that are at least as tall as the dumpster. This provision shall apply to all dumpsters, including those used for the collection and storage of recyclable materials, whether public or private. This provision shall also expressly apply to either the expansion of a use or a significant change in location of the dumpster. [See Sec. 708.A.8] 
F.  Residential Protection Landscape Buffers. 
1.  Residential Protection Landscape Buffers must be installed or preserved along lot lines adjacent to or across an alley from any protected lot. 
2.  Any of the following types of landscape buffers may be used to satisfy the Residential Protection Buffer standards of this subsection. A 6-foot tall solid fence/wall, per Sec. 703.C., may be substituted. 
a.  Type A. A "Type A" landscape buffer has a minimum width of 10 feet, with a minimum of 1 tree and 20 shrubs per 50 linear feet of buffer. 
b.  Type B. A "Type B" landscape buffer requires the provision of a berm, the top of which is at least 21/2 feet higher than the elevation of the "protected" property. The slope of the berm cannot exceed 33 per cent (3:1). The berm must be planted with a minimum of 10 shrubs per 50 linear feet of buffer, along with grass, sod or ground cover. 
c.  Type C. A "Type C" landscape buffer has a minimum width of 20 feet. It requires a minimum of 1 tree and 10 shrubs per 50 linear feet of buffer. 
3.  Use of Landscape Buffers. Required landscape buffers may be used solely for open space and landscaping. No proposed building addition, parking area or any other type of physical land improvement, (other than walls, walkways or other landscape features) may be located in a required landscape buffers. 
4.  Waiver for Small Sites. The area of required Residential Protection Buffers shall not be required to exceed 10 per cent of the site area or 10 per cent of width of the site.

Sec. 708 - Off-Street Parking and Loading 
A.  Applicability. Required and supplemental parking shall be on-site and on a paved surface or as otherwise provided herein. Parking of vehicles in the street right-of-way between the pavement and right-of-way lane is prohibited except as provided by City authorization and regulation for specific locations. 
1.  New Development. The off-street parking and loading standards of this section apply to any new building constructed and to any new use established. 
2.  Expansions and Alterations. The off-street parking and loading standards of this section apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces will be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use, provided that in all cases the number of off-street parking and loading spaces provided for the entire use (pre-existing plus expansion) must equal at least 75 per cent of minimum spaces required according to the tables below. 
3.  Change of Use. Off-street parking and loading must be provided for any change of use or manner of operation what would, based on the tables below, result in a requirement for more parking or loading spaces than for the existing use. Additional parking or loading spaces will be required only in proportion to the extent of the change, not for the entire building or use. 
4.  Independent Parking Lots. Parking areas that are not directly associated with a specific commercial, industrial or any other use, or any areas that are regularly used for parking of 3 or more vehicles shall meet all of the parking lot standards set out in this UDC except as provided in Sec. 708.J.3.a. A lot zoned for parking and adjacent to a directly associated use may be developed for parking as an accessory use although such lot is under separate ownership. 
5.  Loading Space Required. Every building or structure hereafter constructed in any district for nonresidential purposes that requires the receipt of material or merchandise shall provide and maintain on the same lot an off-street loading space, except properties in the downtown business district. 
6.  Loading Space. A loading space is an on-site horizontal space 12 feet wide and 40 feet long and a height clearance of 14 feet from which loading and unloading is made. 
7.  Loading Zone. A loading zone is 1) an on-site area restricted to loading/unloading and vehicle maneuvering, or 2) a space within the public right-of-way where loading/unloading is permitted by City approval. 
8.  Visual Screening of Dumpsters. Dumpsters located on property so as to be visable from a public way shall be screened from view by fencing, walls, berms, or dense landscape buffers that are at least as tall as the dumpster. This provision shall apply to all dumpsters, including those used for collection and storage of recyclable materials. This provision shall apply to the expansion of a use, or the relocation of a dumpster. [See Sec. 705.E.] 
B.  Parking Plan Required. A parking plan shall be submitted to the Planning Director with any application for rezoning, conditional use permit, commercial subdivision or building permit and prior to making any parking lot improvements or curbcuts. Said plan shall be drawn to scale accurately depicting the property lines, easements, structures, sidewalks, parking and loading spaces, aisles, driveways, curbcuts, landscaping areas, drainage and a detail of the surface materials. The plan shall be approved by the Planning Director. 
C.  Spaces Required. The following table describes the number of off-street parking spaces required for various uses.

D.  Rules for Computing Requirements. The following rules apply when computing off-street parking and loading requirements: 
1.  Multiple Uses. Lots containing more than one use must provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses. 
2.  Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of 1/2 or less will be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than 1/2 will be rounded up to the next higher whole number. 
3.  Area Measurements. Unless otherwise expressly stated, all square footage-based parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of net floor area. 
4.  Occupancy-Based Standards. For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces. 
5.  Business Vehicles. When parking spaces are used for the parking of vehicles for sale, in storage or used in the operation of a business, such parking spaces shall be provided in addition to those otherwise required by this Code. Parking spaces for business vehicles shall conform to all of the standards of this section. 
6.  Unlisted Uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in the table above, the Planning Director shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or require a parking study in accordance with subsection D. above. 
E.  Alternative Parking Study. 
1.  Some uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking standard. A developer proposing to develop or expand such a use must submit a parking study that provides justification for the number of off-street parking spaces proposed. 
2.  A parking study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the City Engineer and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. 
3.  The City Engineer shall review the parking study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the establishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed use. After reviewing the parking study, the City Engineer shall establish a minimum off-street parking standard for the proposed use. 
F.  Shared Parking. Developments or uses with different operating hours or peak business periods may share off-street parking spaces if approved as part of a Parking Plan and if the shared parking complies with all of the following standards: 
1.  Location. Shared parking spaces must be located within 300 feet of the primary entrance of all uses served, unless remote parking shuttle service is provided. 
2.  Zoning District Classification. Shared parking areas require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the use served. 
3.  Shared Parking Study. Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements must submit a shared parking analysis to the Planning Director that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. 
4.  Agreement for Shared Parking. A shared parking plan will be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning Director for recording and recording of the agreement must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with this section. 
G.  Stacking Spaces for Drive-Thru Facilities. In addition to meeting the off-street parking requirements of this section, drive-thru facilities shall comply with the following minimum stacking space standards. Such stacking spaces shall not be considered part of any required spaces pertaining to other on-site activities.

Such names and addresses may be subject to change by the City and should never be relied on in place of legal descriptions. 
1.  Name-Change Procedures. Proposed street name changes, whether or not the street is part of a recorded plat, shall be subject to the following review process: 
a.  A legal advertisement for a public hearing by the City Commission shall be published 7 days prior to the hearing. 
b.  Notice of the proposed name change public hearing shall be mailed to the owners of property having access to, and an address on, the subject street. Said notice shall be mailed at least 10 days prior to the hearing. 
c.  The proposed name shall not duplicate, or sound like, an existing street name within the service district of the local 911 office. 
d.  The legal advertisement shall identify the beginning and terminus points of the name change along the street. 
e.  The City Commission shall approve said name change by resolution, stating the date by which the name change becomes official.

Sec. 803 - Streets 
A.  General. 
1.  The location and width of all highways, thoroughfares, streets and roads shall conform to the transportation element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
2.  The proposed street system within any subdivision shall extend existing streets with the same or greater width, but in no case shall any new street be less than the required minimum width, except as provided for in Section C below, and shall provide for extensions of streets and to serve adjacent undeveloped property as recommended by the City Engineer. 
The City of Ardmore, Oklahoma, will not be responsible for the maintenance or grading of, nor will it accept a dedication of any new streets or rights-of-way or utilities that are not developed under the standards and provisions of this Code. 
3.  When the plat submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a preliminary plan of the proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be required with the submitted plat. When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be arranged to permit the logical placement of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provisions for adequate utility easements. 
4.  The Planning Commission may grant subdivision approval for private streets if all conditions for the protection of public health, safety and welfare are met and provided that all private streets are built to public street standards outlined in this UDC.

F.  Cul-de-sac Streets. Cul-de-sac streets or courts designed to have ends permanently closed shall be no more than 500 feet long. Where adequate provision for fire protection is approved by the Fire Chief, the Planning Commission may permit culs-de-sac not to exceed 750 feet in length. There shall be provided, at the closed end of a cul-de-sac, a turnaround having an outside right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. 
G.  Alleys. Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots to be used for business purposes; however, alleys shall not be provided in residential blocks except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the Planning Commission of the need for alleys. 
(Ord. No. 2666, 11-20-00; Ord. No. 2723, 8-19-02) 
Sec. 804 - Easements 
    Adequate easements shall be required by the Planning Commission as recommended by the City Engineer to accommodate all utilities and storm drainage needs. The developer shall demonstrate such adequacy by furnishing drawings showing all utilities and storm drainage. The City Engineer shall recommend easement widths needed to accommodate such utilities and storm drainage systems to the Planning Commission. 
Sec. 805 - Blocks and Lots 
A.  Blocks. 
1.  Residential blocks shall not be less than 400 feet or more than 1,800 feet in length, except as the Planning Commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or to achieve desired features of the street system. In blocks over 1,000 feet long, the Planning Commission may require public crosswalks across the block. 
2.  Residential blocks shall be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except when such blocks front onto freeways, expressways, or major arterials or topographical conditions or size of the property prevents such design, in which case the Planning Commission may approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth. 
B.  Lots. 
1.  Lot area, size, shape, arrangement and dimensions shall conform to the requirements of this UDC. 
2.  Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines. 
3.  Each lot shall abut upon a public or private street or road, except as may be provided within a Planned Unit Development. 
4.  The Planning Commission may grant subdivision approval for private streets if all conditions for the protection of public health, safety and welfare are met and provided that all private streets are built to public street standards outlined in this UDC. 
5.  The size, shape and orientation of every lot shall be as the Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use contemplated. No lot shall be more than four times as deep as it is wide nor shall any lot average less than 100 feet in depth. 
6.  For residential lots not served by the City of Ardmore's sanitary sewer system, a larger lot may be required. Lot sizes shall be determined as follows. The subdivider shall secure a percolation test which meets the Oklahoma State Department of Health regulations for on-site septic tanks on each proposed lot in a subdivision. The location and result of each test shall be indicated on the Preliminary Plat. The dimensions and area of each lot may be established at the level necessary to fulfill the requirements of the state health department. Septic tank disposal fields shall not be located over or adjacent to rock outcrops which serve as present sources of water or which may serve as future sources of water supply. In no case shall a lagoon system be allowed for residential or commercial subdivisions. 
7.  Building lines for residential lots shall be as shown in the table in Sec. 601. However, under a Planned Unit Development, the front and side lot lines may be varied, in order to afford a variety of building arrangements. In no case shall a dwelling unit be closer than 10 feet to any public street. 
8.  Corner lots shall be at least 50 feet wide at the building line. 
9.  Lots, other than corner lots, fronting on two streets shall not be platted except under exceptional circumstances, in which case building lines shall be established on both frontages. 
(Ord. No. 2723, 8-19-02) 
Sec. 806 - Subdivision Improvements 
A.  General. 
1.  The design requirements and required improvements set forth in this section are minimum standards and improvements. Development improvement requirements in environmentally sensitive areas (sensitive soils, slopes, flood hazard areas, woodlands, and the like) may be more stringent as determined by the City Engineer and Planning Director. 
2.  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to all the elements of the Comprehensive Plan and shall be designed in accordance with sound planning and engineering principles as well as the improvement provisions outlined in this chapter. 
3.  Every subdivider shall be required to install all improvements as required by this chapter. 
B.  Street Grading. All streets shall be cleared and graded as approved by the City Engineer. Finished grades shall be at levels approved by the City Engineer. 
C.  Street Paving. 
1.  All streets shall be paved with either bituminous asphalt or concrete to meet standards specified in the Ardmore City Code Section 25-45. Internal streets shall be paved to widths specified in Sec. 803.B.2, and border streets shall be paved to the centerline of said street but at least a minimum of 18 feet. No partial width streets shall be permitted, and streets may be required to provide for extension to adjacent tracts. 
2.  Where a border street to a new subdivision occurs, and in the opinion of the City Engineer, it is impractical to pave said street to 1/2 the width required, the equivalent estimated cost of the paving of such street may be deposited in cash with the City for the future paving of the entire street or the improvement may be waived and/or deferred by the City Commission. 
D.  Curbs and Gutters. Concrete curbs and gutters shall be installed on all streets within the city limits unless the City Engineer grants a waiver for larger rural estate subdivisions on lots greater than 1 acre in size, or unless serious topographic or hydrologic constraints dictate otherwise. Installations shall be in accordance with City specifications. 
E.  Sidewalks. 
1.  Sidewalks shall be required in all residential subdivisions on at least 1 side of the street. At the time a plat is processed, the developer may request city commission approval of a temporary waiver for installing sidewalks in the portion of the plat being submitted for final plat approval. A performance bond or acceptable letter of credit shall be made. Such waiver shall be valid until 50 per cent of the lots are developed or for 5 years after the plat is recorded, whichever comes first. 
2.  Sidewalks shall also be required on both sides of all streets providing direct access to any school site for a distance of 2,000 feet from the property line of said school. 
3.  Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of collectors streets, arterial, and major thoroughfares, and on the property line side of all frontage roads on expressways, freeways or major highways. For large scale commercial plats, the developer may request city commission approval of constructing a sidewalk on 1 side only along any collector or arterial streets within or adjacent to the plat. In such case, the sidewalk shall have a minimum width of 6 feet and shall be located not less than 4 feet from the curb/curbline of the collector or arterial street. For industrial plats, the developer may request that the city commission waive the requirement of constructing sidewalks. 
4.  Sidewalks, except as provided in subsection 3. above, shall be a minimum of 4 feet in width unless placed directly behind the curb, in which case the minimum width shall be 5 feet. The planning commission and the city commission may require additional sidewalks and sidewalk widths near commercial areas, parks, schools, and other places of public assembly. Construction detail drawings shall be provided with a plat application, depicting compliance with ADA requirements for handicap-accessible sidewalks to be constructed as part of the subdivision. 
F.  Water Utility Lines. All lots must be provided with an approved public water system. The subdivider or developer shall install and provide connections to an approved water distribution system for each platted lot and mark the location of the service line as follows: 
1.  For streets with curbing, a "W" shall be chiseled on the face of the curb directly above the water line. 
2.  For streets without curbing, a metal pin at least 3/8 inch in diameter shall be driven into the paved portion of the street directly above the water line and 6 inches from the outer paving edge. 
3.  The water service line shall have a corporation cock at the water main and a curb stop behind the curb on each platted lot. The water service line to each lot shall be installed prior to the paving of the street. 
G.  Sanitary Sewage Disposal. 
1.  Where a public sanitary sewer is available within 1,500 feet, the subdivider shall connect the subdivision with such public sewer and provide connections to each lot. Such sanitary sewer system shall be installed prior to the paving of the street. 
2.  Where a public sanitary sewer system is not available, individual septic tank and lateral lines (drain fields) may be provided if approved beforehand by the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), provided each lot is at least 1 acre in size. In certain cases the DEQ may require larger lots for accommodating necessary lateral lines. Lagoons shall be prohibited within the City limits of Ardmore. 
H.  Electrical, Telephone and Cable Utilities. Electrical, telephone and cable services to a new residential and commercial subdivisions shall be provided via underground routes which shall enter said subdivisions at the perimeter. Electrical distribution lines, telephone lines, cable or other antenna and communication systems shall be installed underground in easements or rights-of-way outside of curb lines. Some electrical transmission and feeder lines may be installed above ground with permission of the Planning Commission and City Commission. Plans showing existing and proposed locations of electrical transmission and feeder lines shall be submitted with the preliminary plat for approval prior to construction. 
I.  Natural Gas Utilities. Natural gas service lines shall be provided underground in easements or rights-of-way outside of curb lines. Plans for such natural gas service shall be submitted with the preliminary plat for approval prior to construction. 
J.  Monumentation. Iron pipes or pins at least one-half inch in diameter and 18 inches long shall be placed flush with the ground at all lot corners and at the beginning and end of all curves. Each subdivision corner shall be marked with iron pipes or pins not less than one-half inch in diameter and 30 inches long at least 1 inch below finished grade. After completion of all improvements by the subdivider, pins or pipes at subdivision corners shall be permanently set in concrete, the top of which shall not come closer than 4 inches to the finished grade. 
K.  Minimum Depth of Utilities. The minimum soil cover shall be met for state and material manufacturer standards. A minimum of 2 feet of soil cover shall be required over all utilities. The developer shall maintain final grades of all lots and streets in such a manner to obtain the minimum cover and shall, by appropriate provision in the plat or by restrictive covenant, require all subsequent owners of such lots and streets to maintain final grades in the same manner. Soil cover in limited areas on gravity flow lines may be reduced to 18 inches if a waiver is granted by the Planning Commission after recommendation from the City Engineer. 
L.  Street Signs and Street Lights. Street name signs shall be provided by the developer according to City standards on diagonally opposite corners or each street intersection in conformance with specifications adopted by the City of Ardmore and installed to specifications adopted by the City. Street lights shall be required by the City of Ardmore and installed to specifications adopted by the City. 
M.  Special Exceptions for Design Waivers. The Planning Commission, upon written request of the subdivider, may waive or modify certain requirements of design, but not of procedure or improvements, whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development of unusual conditions that the strict application of the design requirement contained in these regulations would result in a substantial hardship or inequity. Such waiver or modification may be granted upon written request of the subdivider or his engineer stating the reason for each waiver. Approval of such waiver or modification shall require a 2/3 vote of the regular membership of the Planning Commission. Such waivers or modifications shall also be approved by the City Commission with a 4/5 vote.

Sec. 807 - Stormwater Drainage, Flood Hazard Areas 
A.  Purpose and Scope. 
1.  These regulations and standards are designed, intended and should be administered in a manner to protect the various drainage areas in the City of Ardmore from flooding; to provide clean and sanitary channels for runoff; to prevent pollution of watersheds, streams and natural drainage channels; to prevent the encroachment of buildings and improvements on natural drainage channels; to equitably apportion the cost of improvements; to protect natural scenic areas; to provide for the conservation of the natural resources of the area, and to implement resolutions established by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA). 
2.  All subdivisions of land and all improvements of any character which affect drainage in any portion of the City of Ardmore shall be subject to the provisions of these regulations for the protection of public health, safety and general welfare of the City. 
3.  Development within the limits of the 100 year flood fringe shall be designed in such a manner that all finished flood elevations shall be at least 1 foot above the 100 year flood level, provided however that all earth fills within the 100 year flood level shall be approved by the City Engineer and provided further that development within the 100 year flood plain shall not in any case plan for structures in the floodway as shown on the official flood maps of the City. 
4.  Subdivision of lands within a Flood Hazard District (FHD) identified as Zone A on the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), Flood Hazard Boundary Maps (FHBM), and/or the latest revisions thereof shall comply with the regulations of Sec. 414. 
B.  Finding of Fact. The periodic flooding of areas within the City of Ardmore results in hazards to life and property, in the disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Flood and associated losses are caused by the location in flood hazard areas of buildings, structures and uses of land which are inadequately protected from flooding and erosion, and which contribute to flooding by impeding the flow of drainage and by increasing flood heights through displacement of storm water in floodway and flood-fringe areas. 
C.  Classification of Drainage Channels. For the purpose of these regulations drainage shall be classified as follows: 
1.  "Surface drainage" is runoff of such a limited quantity and/or slow rate that it does not cause erosion of a defined channel. 
2.  "A minor tributary" is any drainage channel having a drainage basin of 100 acres or less in area. 
3.  "A major tributary" is any channel having a drainage basin of not less than 1 square mile or greater than 25 square miles. 
D.  Designation of Responsibility. It is intended that responsibility for drainage be allocated as follows, unless otherwise specifically designated: 
1.  The developer of a subdivision is responsible for the following: 
a.  Construction of facilities to accommodate the increased surface drainage within the subdivision and future developed flows from upstream properties and shall convey same to a point on an identified existing stream system. Such stream system shall have the hydraulic capability to accommodate the increased surface water flow or be modified by the developer in a manner which will do so. 
b.  Obtaining off-site flowage easements and the construction of facilities to accommodate increased flow. Such shall be dedicated to the City. Where such off-site facilities are necessary, the City shall allow the developer the option of constructing on-site retarding and retention structures when environmental and economic conditions prohibit or make unfeasible off-site improvements. 
c.  The improvement of all minor and major tributaries and channels lying within the subdivision. 
d.  Any significant increase in rate or quantity of runoff in any minor or major tributary or major channel which results from the development of the subdivision. 
e.  Provision for the maintenance of all storm water systems and fringe areas of tributaries and channels which have not been dedicated to the public. 
2.  The City and other levels of government will be responsible for the maintenance of floodway and flood-fringe areas dedicated to the public. 
E.  Methods for Determining Flood Hazard Areas. The designation of flood hazard areas is set forth on the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, and/or the latest revisions thereof or city flood studies; the boundary of all floodway and flood-fringe areas shall be designated on the preliminary and the final plat and shall be clearly marked. 
F.  Alternative Methods for Determining Stream Flow and Runoff Characteristics and Drainage Structure Capacities. For all areas not otherwise designated in a floodway or a flood-fringe area, the developer shall be responsible for having an engineer, registered in Oklahoma, prepare a drainage assessment of all of the area of the proposed subdivision, and all area affected by runoff resulting from development of proposed subdivision in accordance with the following provisions: 
1.  The 100-year flow analysis shall be used as a minimum basis for the sizing of all drainage channels, bridges and other critical structures, unless otherwise specified herein. Other design storms should be evaluated as conditions dictate. 
2.  The calculation of all runoff shall be based on saturated urbanization of the drainage basin for minor tributaries and surface drainage, as reflected in the Comprehensive Plan for the city or as specified by the City Engineer, and shall be based on the maximum degree of urbanization, as reflected in the Comprehensive Plan, for the drainage basin of a major tributary or river. 
3.  The calculation of stream flow and runoff characteristics of the subdivision shall be carried out in consultation with the City Engineer, and the methodology and formulas used shall result in quantities comparable to those derived from the application of the following formulas and values: 
a.  Runoff from all drainage areas less than 100 acres shall be not less than determined by Rational Formula: 
Q =  C IA 
Q =  Cubic feet per second 
C =  Per cent of imperviousness of the area. A composite runoff coefficient shall be developed by the registered engineer based upon the percentage of different types of surface in the drainage area. Such value shall be derived using the Table of Runoff Coefficients in Item B3C or equivalent as may be approved by the City Engineer. No composite value of less than .50 may be used for saturated urban development. 
I =  Rate of rainfall over entire drainage area in inches per hour based on time of concentration and latest government records for area. 
A =  Area to be drained in acres, determined by field surveys for areas less than 640 acres, and by latest government quadrangle maps for larger areas. 
b.  The size of closed storm sewers, open channels, culverts, and bridges shall be not less than that determined by using the Manning Formula: 
Q =  1.486/N*A*(0.33R)*(0.5S) 
Q =  Discharge in cubic feet per second 
N =  Roughness coefficient, based on condition and type of material of conduit lining, but not less than 0.013 
A =  Cross sectional area of water in conduit in square feet 
R =  Hydraulic radius of water in conduit 
S =  Mean slope of hydraulic gradient, in feet of vertical rise per foot of horizontal distance 
c.  Runoff coefficients for computation of composite value. 
Surface Runoff Coefficient Street, Parking, Walk or Driveway  Asphaltic or Concrete .95 - 1.00  Brick .85 - 1.00  Gravel .25 - .70 Roofs .95 - 1.00 Sandy Soil  Flat (up to 2%) .05 - .30  Average (2% to 7%) .10 - .40  Steep (over 7%) .15 - .50 Heavy Soil  Flat (up to 2%) .15 - .50  Average (2% to 7%) .20 - .60  Steep (over 7%) .30 - .75  
4.  The design engineer shall have the option of using the City of Tulsa, Oklahoma's manuals or other widely accepted drainage criteria manuals for hydrologic and hydraulic design with the approval of the City Engineer. 
5.  The engineer shall submit, at the time of preliminary plat, the following exhibits as part of a drainage design narrative report with substantiating calculations in order to expedite its review. Whenever various technical publications are used as design references, they will be given in a "Bibliography of References." 
a.  A general location map for the subdivision showing the entire watershed. The proposed subdivision shall be accurately outlined on this map. The drainage areas shall be outlined and will be shown in acres, runoff coefficient values, and CfS. 
b.  A topographic (contour) map of the subdivision showing lots, blocks, streets and any unusual features or filled areas. 
c.  A drainage outlet plan, cross-section and/or notes to explain the plan for handling water after it leaves the subdivision shall be submitted. 
d.  The engineer shall furnish the high water mark elevation of any river, major and minor tributaries, diversion ditch, dry gully, arroyo, channel, canal, etc., that may in any way affect the subdivision (use cross-sections, profiles and narrative report, if necessary). Where no high water mark is available, one shall be calculated based upon a 100-year storm frequency. The anticipated depth of flow is particularly important so that suitable finish grades at building foundations can be established. All elevations shall be referenced to U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Data. 
G.  Flood Hazard Areas on Major Tributaries and Rivers. All floodway and flood fringe areas located within the subdivision shall be protected and improved by the developer as follows: 
1.  All floodways shall be designated as "Flowage Easements" and shall be maintained as permanent open space for use for private recreation or agriculture for which no buildings or structures are required, or dedicated to the public for drainage, recreation and utility use. 
2.  All flood fringe areas shall be planned for uses which are permitted in the flood fringe area of the zoning ordinance, and in no case shall the proposed use or construction cause a displacement of flood water in the flood fringe that will increase flooding in other areas of the floodway or flood fringe. 
3.  When it is determined by the City Engineer that the development of the subdivision will significantly increase runoff in the flood hazard area or will otherwise adversely affect storm water runoff, the Planning Commission may require any or all of the following to the extent needed to reduce the adverse affects of the development: 
a.  The existing floodway laying within or immediately adjacent to the subdivision shall be cleaned to provide for the free flow of water, and the channel shall be straightened, widened, and improved to the extent required to prevent overflow beyond the limits of the floodway. 
b.  Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building sites and streets to an elevation where all lots, building areas, and streets will not be subject to overflow, and in a manner that will provide for the rapid runoff of all rainfall; however, such improvements shall be carried out in a manner that will preserve and protect large trees and attractive physical features of the area. 
c.  Whenever channel improvement is carried out, sodding, backsloping, cribbing, and other bank protection shall be designed and constructed to control erosion for all the anticipated conditions to flow for the segment of channel involved. 
d.  A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer, or unless a paved street surface is provided on both sides of a paved channel to give access to abutting properties. 
e.  Culverts, bridges, and other drainage structures shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications of the city at all locations where drainage channels intersect with continuous streets or alleys. 
H.  Minor Tributaries and Surface Drainage Improvements. All minor tributaries and surface drainage located within or immediately adjacent to and serving the subdivision shall be improved by the developer, as follows: 
1.  All minor tributary channels shall be improved with 3:1 or flatter side slopes or other equivalent standards, as determined by the City Engineer. They shall be designed as an integral part of the landscape of the areas so that maintenance of sodded slopes will be the responsibility of the property owners abutting the channels shall be designed to carry a 100-year maximum flood, shall be designed for self-cleaning and ease of maintenance, shall have sufficient hard surface along the flow line to prevent ponding of water, and shall have design characteristics of alignment, materials of construction and cross-sectioned elements that will be hydraulically efficient and visually harmonious with the adjacent landscape. 
2.  Enclosed storm sewers may be required by the City Engineer where special or unusual conditions make open channels hazardous or otherwise unfeasible. 
3.  A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless it is placed in a closed storm sewer, or unless a paved street surface is located on both sides of a paved drainage channel to give access to abutting properties. 
4.  Site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that surface water from each lot shall flow directly to a storm sewer, improved channel or paved street without crossing more than two adjacent lots. 
5.  Surface water collected on streets shall be diverted to storm drains at satisfactory intervals to prevent overflow of 6-inch high curbs during a ten-year frequency rain for the area and grades involved; provided, however, that in no case shall the drainage area served by one street exceed 20 acres, regardless of the amount of flow. 
6.  Drainage easements shall be wide enough to convey the 100-year frequency storm and provide working room for construction and maintenance for all storm sewers and drainage easements. In no case shall the total easement be less than 20 feet. 
7.  Bridges and Culverts. 
a.  Bridges or culverts shall be provided where water courses cross continuous streets or alleys. 
b.  Bridges and culverts shall be sized to accommodate a 100-year frequency rain, based on the drainage area involved. 
c.  Design of bridges and culverts shall conform to city construction specifications. 
8.  Closed Storm Sewers. Closed storm sewers shall be constructed of pre-cast prefabricated pipe or built in place of closed box design to conform with city construction specifications to serve a ten-year frequency rain for the drainage area involved. 
9.  Open Paved Storm Drainage. 
a.  Open paved storm drainage channels shall be constructed in accordance with City specifications. 
b.  Side slopes above the paved section shall be shaped and sodded on a slope of four horizontal to one vertical or flatter. 
c.  Fences shall be outside of the 100-year frequency flooding line, shall not be erected below the shoulder of the sodded section, and in no case shall fences be closer than six feet (measured horizontally) to the edge of the paved section. 
d.  Hand-laid rip rap may be substituted for sodded shoulders where desired for landscape purposes. 
I.  Drainage and Sewers Outside Subdivision Boundaries. The City reserves the right to require improvements, provisions of drainage easements, and for provision of agreements beyond the boundaries of the subdivision to facilitate flow of water through the addition, to avoid probability of law suits based on damage from changed runoff in the subdivision, and to provide continuous improvement of the overall storm drainage system. Requirements outside the addition may include the following: 
1.  Improvements may be required in channels or storm sewers flowing to or from the addition, or in channels or storm sewers located in adjacent areas that are affected by flow of water from the addition. 
2.  The following kinds of improvements may be required: 
a.  Enlargement or replacement of undersized drainage structures to provide free flow. 
b.  Removal of obstructions. 
c.  Straightening of channel. 
d.  Widening or deepening of the channel. 
e.  Construction of erosion control structures. 
f.  Back sloping, sodding and/or rip rapping of bank. 
g.  Construction of closed or open paved storm sewers for the purposes of closing gap or continuation of overall storm sewer system. 
3.  Property owner agreements, where required, shall be designed to protect the city from probable law suits for damage, caused by changed runoff condition. 
4.  When subdivision development will result in increased runoff beyond the boundaries of the subdivision which cannot be accommodated through channel improvements without causing downstream flooding, the Planning Commission may require the construction of one or more detention reservoirs on the subdivision which will temporarily impound and discharge water from the subdivision site at the rate and volume equivalent to the discharge from the undeveloped subdivision site at a rate and volume that the off-site channel is capable of taking. The design shall be for a 100-year frequency flood. Plans shall be approved by the City Engineer. The construction shall be the responsibility of the Developer, the responsibility for maintenance shall be determined on a case by case basis during the subdivision review process.

Sec. 808 - Guidelines for Extending Streets and Utilities 
    Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to provide a method with guidelines for extending streets, water lines, sanitary sewer, and storm sewer lines for existing development, newly developed areas and individual improvements within the City of Ardmore and who may petition the city for such improvements or be required to connect to said utilities. The City Commission may use any of a variety of methods for said extensions including but not limited to property owner funding with or without "buy-in" agreements, shared costs methods, bonds and special improvement districts.

Any use which was in violation of a provision of the zoning ordinances of the City of Ardmore in effect at the time of the adoption of this UDC, or amendments thereto, and which does not conform to the provisions of this UDC, and/or amendments thereto, shall be considered a violation of this UDC and shall not have any of the rights granted below. 
B.  Authority to Continue. Nonconformities shall be allowed to continue in accordance with the regulations of this chapter. 
C.  Determination of Nonconformity Status. The burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists is the owner's burden, not the City's.

6.  As an exception to the provisions in paragraph 1 above, repairs or maintenance will be permitted to existing single family detached dwellings in commercial or industrial districts. In addition, the reconstruction of existing single family detached dwellings not to exceed their original square footage will be permitted in said districts where existing single family dwellings have been destroyed by a natural disaster or by fire.

1.  The City Commission finds that, in view of the inexpensive nature of these signs and the administrative burden that would be imposed by elaborate procedural prerequisites prior to removal, any procedure other than summary removal of these signs when unlawfully erected and maintained would defeat the purpose of regulating such signs.

Sec. 1007 - Enforcement Actions Involving Agricultural Operators 
    Before taking enforcement action to correct a violation of this UDC by any agricultural operator, the City Commission shall investigate the alleged violation to determine whether a violation of this UDC exists, and whether the activity is protected under the City's Right to Farm and Ranch policy (see Sec. 104) as "historical, traditional, reasonable and legitimate." 
Chapter 11. - Definitions 

Sec. 1101 - General 
    For the purpose of this UDC, certain terms and words are to be used and interpreted as defined in this chapter. 
Sec. 1102 - Rules of Construction 
    The following rules of construction shall be used when construing this UDC: 
1.  Words used in the present tense shall include the future tenses; words in the singular number include the plural and words in the plural number include the singular, except where the natural construction of the writing indicates otherwise. 
2.  The word "shall" is mandatory and not directory. 
3.  The word "building" includes the word "structure." 
Sec. 1103 - Use Categories 
A.  Basis for Classifications. Use categories classify land uses and activities into use categories based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. 
B.  Principal Uses. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The "Characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use. 
1.  Developments with Multiple Principal Uses. When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore and bakery, for example, would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service category because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category. 
2.  Accessory Uses. Accessory uses are allowed by-right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Also, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions. 
3.  Use of Examples. The "Examples" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "Wholesale Warehouse" but that sells mostly to consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the Retail Sales and Service category. 
C.  Similar Use Interpretation Criteria. The following considerations shall be used in making similar use interpretations: 
1.  The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category; 
2.  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity; 
3.  Relative amounts of sales from each activity; 
4.  The customer type for each activity; 
5.  The relative number of employees in each activity; 
6.  Hours of operation; 
7.  Building and site arrangement; 
8.  Vehicles used with the activity; 
9.  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; and 
10.  How the use advertises itself. 
D.  Residential Use Categories. 
1.  Group Living. 
a.  Characteristics. Group Living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a structure by a group of people who do not meet the definition of Household Living. The size of the group may be larger than the average size of a household. Tenancy is arranged on a monthly or longer basis.

They are considered to be a form of transient lodging (see the Retail Sales and Service and Community Service categories). Generally, Group Living structures have a common eating area for residents. The residents may receive care, training, or treatment, as long as the care givers also reside at the site. 
b.  Accessory Uses. Accessory uses commonly associated with Group Living are recreational facilities and parking of vehicles for occupants and staff.

2.  Household Living. 
a.  Characteristics. Household Living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a household. Tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month or longer basis. Uses where tenancy may be arranged for a shorter period are not considered residential. They are considered to be a form of transient lodging (see the Retail Sales and Service and Community Service categories). 
b.  Accessory Uses. Accessory uses commonly associate with Household Living are recreational activities, raising of pets, hobbies and parking of the occupants' vehicles. Home occupations are accessory uses that are subject to additional regulations. 
c.  Examples. Uses include living in houses, duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes and other multi-dwelling structures, retirement center apartments, manufactured housing and other structures with self-contained dwelling units. 
d.  Exceptions. Lodging in a structure where less than two thirds of the units are rented on a monthly or longer basis is considered a hotel or motel use and is classified in the Retail Sales and Service category. 
E.  Office Use Categories. 
1.  Office. 
a.  Characteristics. Office uses are characterized by activities conducted in an office setting and generally focusing on business, government, professional, medical, or financial services and are not considered as commercial. 
b.  Accessory Uses. Accessory uses may include cafeterias, health facilities, parking, or other amenities primarily for the use of employees in the firm or building.
