PREFACE 
    This volume contains the Code of Ordinances of the Town of Lexington, South Carolina, and is a 
republication of the 1982 Code supplemented by LexisNexis Municipal Codes through Ordinance No. 
2005-09, as originally codified by American Legal Publishing Company. This 2008 republication includes 
all amendatory legislation through Ordinance No. 2007-31, adopted August 6, 2007, and was 
accomplished under the supervision of Diana Ossi, Editor. 
    Non-textual provisions such as severability clauses, repeal, and enacting clauses are omitted from 
the text but are covered in Title I of this Code that applies to the entire Code of Ordinances. In most 
instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" 
or "this section" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes such as state law references and cross 
references have been included throughout the Code to clarify its provisions. 
    This Code is designed to serve as a complete compilation of ordinances and as a reliable reference 
guide. The citations included at the end of sections refer to the official source and date of former code 
sections and original ordinances. Sections of the Code which do not have a citation represent new 
ordinances that have been added to fill gaps or to replace ordinances which have become outdated. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a part of the Code, the number to the left 
of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

control and review false alarm reduction efforts and administers the provisions of this ordinance. 
    "ALARM COMPANY" means a person subject to the licensing requirements, and/or a company 
engaged in selling, leasing, installing, servicing or monitoring alarm systems. 
    "ALARM PERMIT" means a permit issued by the Town allowing the operation of an alarm system 
within the Town. 
    "ALARM SIGNAL" means a detectable signal; audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to 
which law enforcement is requested to respond. 
    "ALARM SYSTEM" means any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the 
occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other illegal activity requiring immediate attention and to 
which law enforcement is requested to respond, but does not include motor vehicle or boat alarms, fire 
alarms, domestic violence alarms, or alarms designed to elicit a medical response. 
    "ALARM USER" means any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, governmental or 
educational entity or any other entity owning, leasing or operating an alarm system, or on whose 
premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
    "ALARM USER AWARENESS CLASS" means a class conducted for the purpose of educating alarm 
users about the responsible use, operation, and maintenance of alarm systems and the problems created 
by false alarms. 
    "AUTOMATIC DIAL PROTECTION DEVICE" means an automatic dialing device or an automatic 
telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which, upon being activated, automatically 
initiates to the Lexington Police Department a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for law 
enforcement response. 
    "CANCELLATION" means the process where response is terminated when the alarm company 
(designated by the alarm user) notifies the Lexington Police Department that there is not an existing 
situation at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch request. If cancellation occurs 
prior to police arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of civil/criminal penalty, and 
no penalty will be assessed. 
    "FALSE ALARM" means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, 
malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, and 
signals activated to summon law enforcement personnel unless law enforcement response was cancelled 
by the alarm user or his/her agent before law enforcement personnel arrive at the alarm location. An 
alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the Lexington Police 
Department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed 
or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be 
determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include 
other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user. 
    "LOCAL ALARM" means an alarm system that emits a signal at an alarm site that is audible or 
visible from the exterior of a structure and is not monitored by a remote monitoring facility, whether

permit is issued.

appear to be caused by separate human action. The Lexington Police Department may in its discretion 
discontinue police responses to alarm signals from what appears to be a runaway alarm. 
    "SIA CONTROL PANEL STANDARD CP-01" means the American National Standard Institute 
(ANSI) approved Security Industry Association (SIA) CP-01 Control Panel Standard, as may be updated 
from time to time, that details recommended design features for security system control panels and their 
associated arming and disarming devices to reduce false alarms. Control panels built and tested to this 
standard by a nationally recognized testing organization, will be marked to state: "Design evaluated in 
accordance with SIA CP-01 Control Panel Standard Features for False Alarm Reduction". 
    "TOWN" means the Town of Lexington or its agent. 
    "VERIFY" means an attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm 
site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a 
person is made, to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law 
enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. For the purpose of 
this ordinance, telephone verification shall require, as a minimum that a second call be made to a 
different number if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves to 
attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch.

change. In addition, each year after the issuance of the permit, permit holders will receive from the 
Town a form requesting updated information. The permit holder shall complete and return this form 
to the Town when any of the requested information has changed; failure to comply will constitute a 
violation and may result in a civil penalty. 
(E) ?Multiple alarm systems. If an alarm user has one or more alarm systems protecting two (2) or more 
separate structures having different addresses and/or tenants, a separate permit shall be required

this ordinance may be appealed by filing a written notice of appeal with the Lexington Police 
Department within ten (10) days after the date of notification of the assessment of civil penalty(ies) or

§ 39.01 - Adoption of policy. 
    The Town of Lexington hereby adopts the attached Freedom of Information Act Policy, effective 
immediately. 
Town of Lexington Freedom of Information Act Policy 
    Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests. It is the Policy of the Town that its public records 
are open to public inspection and its meetings are open as required by the state Freedom of Information 
Act. The Town will fully comply with all requests made either by written request or e-mail to a department 
employee. 
    The Town recognizes the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act (South Carolina Code 30-4-10) 
enacted by the South Carolina General Assembly gives every citizen the right to access government 
meetings, documents and records. By standardizing the Town's procedures for processing Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) requests and establishing reasonable fees for such requests, the Town will ensure 
its compliance with FOIA and its intended goal of transparency of Town operations and policies. 
    All requests for information pursuant to the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) must 
be made in writing and submitted in person or by mail, email or fax to the Town of Lexington. To ensure 
accuracy in the Town's response, all requests should be as descriptive as possible. In accordance with 
FOIA, the Town of Lexington must: 
• For records less than twenty-four (24) months old, notify the person making the request of the 
Town's determination as to the public availability of the requested public record within ten (10) 
working days (excludes Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) and produce the 
requested information within thirty (30) calendar days of the later of either Town's notification as 
to the availability of the requested public record or the date an advance deposit is made if 
required by the Town. 
• For records more than twenty-four (24) months old, notify the person making the request of 
the Town's determination as to the public availability of the requested public record within 
twenty (20) working days (excludes Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) and produce 
the requested information, within thirty-five (35) calendar days of the later of either Town's 
notification as to the availability of the requested public record or the date an advance deposit is 
made if required by the Town. 
    A written FOIA request is not required to obtain the following: 
• Minutes of meetings within the past six (6) months 
• Documents produced by the Town or its agents and distributed to or reviewed by members of 
the public body during a public meeting in the past six (6) months 
• All reports related to the nature, location and substance of a crime committed in the last 
fourteen (14) days 
• Documents identifying individuals confined to any jail, detention center or prison in the past 
three (3) months (excluding restricted juvenile records) 
    In order to assist citizens making FOIA requests, the Town has developed a suggested FOIA 
Request Form, which shall be available on the Town's website. This form is only intended to ease the 
process for citizens when making their written FOIA requests and is not a requirement by the Town to 
process any written requests it receives. 
    The attached fee schedule shall also be made available on the Town's website. It outlines 
reasonable costs that may be incurred by the requesting party during the Town's FOIA request 
processing. If fees apply, a twenty-five percent (25%) deposit shall be required prior to staff starting the 
research process. Once research is complete, the Town shall be entitled to collect the remaining portion 
of the fee before providing the requested information. 
    Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 30-2-50, a person or private entity shall not knowingly obtain or 
use personal information obtained from the Town for commercial solicitation directed to any 
person in this State. All persons making FOIA requests to the Town are hereby notified that 
obtaining or using public records for commercial solicitation directed to any person in this State 
is prohibited. A person knowingly violating the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. § 30-2-50 is guilty of 
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars 
($500.00) or imprisoned for a term not to exceed one year, or both. 
Notes: 
    The determination on the availability of a public record is not required to include a final decision or 
express an opinion as to whether specific portions of the documents or information may be subject to 
redaction according to exemptions provided for by Section 30-4-40 or other state or federal laws. Any 
questions about the Town's FOIA policy should be directed to the Town Attorney's Office at 803-951-2232 
or email townattorney@lexsc.com. 
    The Town is not required to create an electronic copy of a record where one does not already exist. 
    The FOIA does not require the Town to answer a list of specific questions, nor provide requested 
information in a format other than that in which it is kept. 
    Inspection and / or copying of documents is limited to business hours only. Requestors should call in 
advance to schedule an appointment with the appropriate department head. 
    The Town reserves the right to seek relief under S.C. Code Section 30-4-110 from unduly 
burdensome, overly broad, vague, repetitive, or otherwise improper requests, or where it has received a 
request but it is unable to make a good faith determination as to whether the information is exempt from 
disclosure.

achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in 
§ 51.02.03 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by the State or the Superintendent, 
whichever is more stringent. All facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and 
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall 
be submitted to the Superintendent for review, and shall be approved by the Superintendent before such 
facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the 
user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge in 
compliance with the provisions of this ordinance or obtaining permits to construct or operate from other 
agencies or South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC). 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.03.02 - ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES. 
(A) ?Whenever deemed necessary for protection or preservation of public health and safety and the 
POTW, the Superintendent may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, 
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or 
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and 
impose such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's 
compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(B) ?The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on 
their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to en sure equalization 
of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(C) ?Grease interceptors. A grease interceptor is a device which serves to trap and retain within its 
confines all suspended or semi-solid grease which may have been passed through sinks, drains or 
other fixtures. The retained grease is then kept from entering the service line which connects the 
business to the main collector sewer. Ultimately and on a timely basis, the grease must be removed 
by the owner/operator of the business and disposed of in a satisfactory fashion. This may be by the 
owner/operator or by professionals who contract for this type of work. 
(1) ?Oil separator. A device which serves to trap and retain oils or other flammable liquid to prohibit 
the introduction of same into the sewer system by accident or otherwise. 
(2) ?Sand separator. A device which is designed to trap sand and other solids and prohibit its entry 
into the sewer system. 
(3) ?Application of devices. 
(a) ?Interceptors or separators shall be provided for all restaurants, snack bars, fast food 
restaurants or carry out food restaurants or any other areas such as service station or 
residential complex wash racks, automatic car washes or auto service areas, coin 
laundries, hospitals or other businesses which, in the opinion of the Town, deem them 
necessary to for the proper handling of wastes generated by each business. 
(b) ?The size, type and location of each interceptor or separator or dilution device shall be 
determined by town personnel from plans and specifications submitted to them. Design is 
the responsibility of the owner/developer. No device shall be installed prior to written 
approval from the Town. 
(c) ?No wastes other than those requiring treatment or separation shall be discharged into any 
interceptor except as approved by the Town. 
(d) ?Interceptors or separators will be required at an existing business if its discharge causes 
malfunctions with the operation of the towns sewer system. Upon notification, the business 
will have thirty (30) days to respond with their plans for installation of a proper device. 
Upon approval the business will have an additional thirty (30) days to have the device 
installed and in operation. Failure to comply will result in termination of the water or sewer 
service to the business until corrective action has been completed. 
(4) ?Size and type of device. Outside grease traps shall be installed wherever possible and shall be 
incorporated into the planning for the property and submitted for approval. A minimum of one 
thousand (1,000) gallons is recommended and is available as a pre-fabricated type or as a 
modified septic tank type. Such type shall be installed with two (2) manhole access ring and 
cover combinations which allow for easy access and inspection. 
Where a building is to be retrofitted for use of a business that will require a device as described, 
a plan shall be submitted for approval. This plan shall include the detail of sizing. In such cases, 
it is sometimes impossible to retrofit an outside device and an inside trap must be substituted. 
While this type is not recommended due to limited capacity and difficulty in maintenance and 
inspection, it will be allowed if properly sized and maintained. The Town reserves the right to 
prohibit the continued use of this type should it not function properly or due to continued 
citations for improper maintenance. 
(5) ?Inspection by Town of Lexington. As previously indicated, a formal plan and application must 
be submitted to the Town for approval prior to installation and upon approval, a written approval 
will be issued by the Town. 
Upon completion of the installation, an inspection will be required by the Utilities Department 
prior to operational approval being issued. 
Once operational, shall be cleaned quarterly and reported to the Utilities Department. The 
Utilities Department shall require access to inspect the operation of said device during normal 
and reasonable working hours to determine if the device is being properly maintained and is 
functioning as designed. Should any deficiency be noted, the inspecting official shall issue a 
notice for correction which shall be done within five (5) calendar days following that date. The 
issuance of more than two (2) notices within one year shall constitute grounds for action by the 
Town to demand corrective changes which shall be determined in each individual case by the 
Utilities Director or Utilities Superintendent. 
(D) ?Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain 
an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(E) ?Use of grease emulsifiers prohibited. The use of grease emulsifiers is prohibited by Town of 
Lexington ordinance and by sanitary sewer system use policy.

(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT ISSUANCE PROCESS 


§ 51.05.01 - WASTE LOAD ALLOCATION. 
    The Superintendent will evaluate the waste survey questionnaire data furnished by the nondomestic 
user and may require additional information. Within forty-five (45) days of receipt of waste survey 
questionnaire and other information, the Superintendent will establish the waste load allocation limits for 
the proposed discharge. Upon payment of a nonrefundable waste load allocation fee the Superintendent 
will issue a waste load allocation, setting the discharge capacity and limits in the POTW for the proposed 
discharges by the nondomestic user. The waste load allocation will be issued for a period of one year; or, 
until such time as the nondomestic user submits the final plans or sufficient documentation to the Town 
and a permit is issued by the Town, whichever comes first. The waste load allocation is not transferable 
to any other user or for any other discharge than the proposed discharge. Payment of the waste 
allocation fee will secure the nondomestic user's capacity and limits in the POTW as set forth in the waste 
load allocation for a period of one year, provided, that suitable pretreatment facilities are proposed or 
sufficient documents are provided by the nondomestic user that are acceptable to the superintendent and 
that will demonstrate to a reasonable certainty that the limits can be met. Approval of plans or 
documentation by the Superintendent does not relieve the nondomestic user from the liability of the 
design of the pretreatment facilities nor full compliance with any permits issued. Within one year from the 
date of establishment of waste load allocation limits, the nondomestic user shall submit to the 
Superintendent, a completed application form, final plans and other information as discussed under § 
51.04.05 of this chapter. Failure to submit this information will result in the expiration of the waste load 
allocation without further remedy unless a prior written request by the nondomestic user for an extension 
of the waste load allocation has been received by the Superintendent prior to the waste load allocation 
expiration date. An extension of the waste load allocation will be for a period of up to an additional one 
year and upon payment of an additional nonrefundable waste load allocation fee, as well as other 
applicable fees that would be due based upon the allocated discharge limits as if the nondomestic user 
were discharging those limits even though the nondomestic user may not discharge until the operation 
permits are issued by SCDHEC pursuant to this chapter. Within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of 
complete information, the Superintendent will determine whether or not to issue a wastewater discharge 
permit. The user may obtain the permit upon payment of the appropriate fees according to §§ 51.14 and 
51.15 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.05.02 - WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT DURATION. 
    A wastewater discharge permit shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five (5) 
years from the effective date of the permit. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued for a period less 
than five (5) years, at the discretion of the Superintendent. Each wastewater discharge permit will indicate 
a specific date upon which it will expire.

§ 51.06.08 - NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING. 
    If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Superintendent within 
twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and 
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within thirty (30) days after 
becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the Superintendent monitors at 
the user's facility's at least once a month, or if the Superintendent samples between the user's initial 
sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.06.09 - NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. 
(A) ?Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the Superintendent, the 
EPA Regional Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge 
into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 
CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or 
other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar 
month to the POTW the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such 
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents 
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the 
wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents 
in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All 
notifications must take place no later than thirty (30) days after the discharge commences. Any 
notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. 
However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under § 51.06.05 of this chapter. 
The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users 
subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§ 51.06.01, 
51.06.03, and 51.06.04 of this chapter. 
(B) ?Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (A) of this section during a calendar 
month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the 
wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of 
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quality 
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time 
notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any 
hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(C) ?In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional 
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the 
user must notify the Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, 
and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of 
the effective date of such regulations. 
(D) ?In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in 
place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has 
determined to be economically practical. 
(E) ?This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be 
discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.06.10 - ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS. 
    All pollutants analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater 
discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 
40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling 
and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by SCDHEC. The user shall 
report, to the City of all the sample analyses conducted according to 40 CFR Part 136 or SCDHEC 
approved procedures, including those that are not designed for periodic compliance under § 51.06.04 of 
this chapter. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.06.11 - SAMPLE COLLECTION. 
(A) ?Except as indicated in subsection (B) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples 
using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is 
infeasible, the Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or minimum of 
four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of 
the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with 
instantaneous discharge limits. 
(B) ?Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic 
compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.06.12 - TIMING. 
    Written report will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are 
not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of 
receipt of the report shall govern. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.06.13 - RECORD KEEPING. 
    User subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for 
inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required 
by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities 
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, 
method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses 
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results 
of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of a least three (3) years. This period 
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user to the Town, or 
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Superintendent. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


COMPLIANCE MONITORING 


§ 51.07.01 - RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING. 
    The Superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the 
user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order 
issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the 
purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any 
additional duties. 
(A) ?Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance 
before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security 
guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Superintendent will be permitted 
to enter with our delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(B) ?The Superintendent shall that right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, 
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(C) ?The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The 
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and 
proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All flow measuring devices shall be 
calibrated at least once every six (6) months. To insure accuracy, all water quality analysis shall 
be justified using blanks. 
(D) ?Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected 
and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the 
Superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by 
the user. 
(E) ?Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the user's premises shall be a 
violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.07.02 - SEARCH WARRANTS. 
    If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part 
thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this 
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling 
program of the Town designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any permit or order issued 
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the 
Superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.08.01 - CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit 
applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Superintendent's 
inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user 
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the release 
of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection 
as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission 
of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such 
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or 
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available 
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or 
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not 
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.09.01 - PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE. 
    The Superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the 
municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, 
were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term 
significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(A) ?Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six 
percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six (6) month period 
exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any 
amount; 
(B) ?Technical Review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent 
(33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) 
month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit 
multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other 
pollutants except pH); 
(C) ?Any other violation that the Superintendent believes has caused, alone or in combination with 
other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW 
personnel or the general public; 
(D) ?Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the 
environment, or has resulted in the Superintendent's exercise of its emergency authority to halt 
or prevent such a discharge; 
(E) ?Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule 
milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting 
construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(F) ?Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including 
baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard 
deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance 
schedules; 
(G) ?Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(H) ?Any other violation(s) which the Superintendent determines will adversely affect the operation 
or implementation of the local pretreatment program 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES 


§ 51.10.01 - NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION. 
    When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this 
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or 
requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten (10) 
days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction 
and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the 
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring 
before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the 
Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without 
first issuing a notice of violation. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.10.02 - CONSENT ORDERS. 
    The Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other 
similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such 
documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time 
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the 
administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 51.10.04 and 51.10.05 of this chapter and shall be judicially 
enforceable. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.10.03 - SHOW CAUSE HEARING. 
    The Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of 
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment 
standard or requirement, to appear before the Superintendent and show cause why the proposed 
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place 
for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the 
user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting 
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least seven (7) 
days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A 
show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the 
user. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.10.04 - COMPLIANCE ORDERS. 
    When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this 
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit to order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or 
requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing 
that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance 
within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, 
devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may 
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and 
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A 
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or 
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any 
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, 
taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.10.05 - CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS. 
    When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this 
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or 
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an order to 
the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(A) ?Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(B) ?Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a 
continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any 
other action against the user. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.10.06 - ADMINISTRATIVE FINES. 
(A) ?When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this 
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment 
standard or requirement, the Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not less than one 
hundred dollars ($100.00) and not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such fines shall be 
assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of a continuing violation, each day's offense 
shall be counted as a separate and distinct offense. Fines for a continuing violation shall be 
assessed for each day during the period of violation. Depending on the severity of the violation, the 
Town may elect to take other enforcement action(s) with or without imposing a fine. 
(B) ?Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an 
additional penalty of five percent (5%) of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a 
rate of one percent (1%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid 
charges, fines, and penalties. 
(C) ?Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Superintendent to reconsider 
the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. 
Where a request has merit, the Superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event 
the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be 
returned to the user. The Superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement 
actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(D) ?Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other 
action against the user. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.10.07 - EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS. 
    The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, 
whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably 
appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of 
persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and 
opportunity to respond, that threatened to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or 
may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(A) ?Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its 
contribution. In the event of a users failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the 
suspension order, the Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including 
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its 
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent may allow the user 
to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the 
Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination 
proceedings in § 51.10.08 of this chapter are initiated against the user. 
(B) ?A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent 
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful 
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent 
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under § 51.10.03 or 51.10.08 of this 
chapter. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension 
under this section. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.10.08 - TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE. 
    In addition to the provisions in § 51.05.07 this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions 
is subject to discharge termination: 
(A) ?Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(B) ?Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(C) ?Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and 
characteristics prior to discharge; 
(D) ?Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, 
or sampling; 
(E) ?Violation of the pretreatment standards in § 51.02 of this chapter; 
(F) ?Falsifying reports; 
(G) ?Failure to install monitoring equipment (intention al); 
(H) ?Improper sampling scheme; 
(I) ?Violation of compliance schedule; or 
(J) ?Wastewater dilution, in lieu of treatment. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity 
to show cause § 51.10.03 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this 
option by the Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against 
the user. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES 


§ 51.11.01 - INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. 
    When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this 
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or 
requirement, the Superintendent may petition Lexington County Court of Common Pleas through the 
Town's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains 
or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirements 
imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek such other action as 
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct 
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, 
taking any other action against a user. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.11.02 - CIVIL PENALTIES. 
(A) ?A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater 
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall 
be liable to the Town for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per 
violation per day. In addition, the Town may seek a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed two 
thousand dollars ($2,000.00) pursuant to S.C. Code § 6-11-285. In the case of a monthly or other 
long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the 
violation. 
(B) ?The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses 
associated with enforcement activities, including medical treatment of injured Town employees, 
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Town. 
(C) ?In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant 
circumstances, including but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude 
and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 


§ 51.13.01 - UPSET. 
(A) ?For the purposes of this section "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is 
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of 
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the 
extent caused by the operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate 
treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(B) ?An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with 
categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (C) of this section. 
(C) ?A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly 
signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1) ?An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2) ?The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in 
compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3) ?The user has submitted the following information to the Superintendent within twenty-four (24) 
hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission 
must be provided within five (5) days: 
(a) ?A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(b) ?The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the 
anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(c) ?Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the 
noncompliance. 
(D) ?In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have 
the burden of proof. 
(E) ?Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an 
enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(F) ?Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with 
categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the 
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the 
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, 
lost, or fails 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.13.02 - PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARD. 
    A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action bought against it for 
noncompliance with the general prohibitions § 51.02.03(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in § 
51.02.03(B)(3) through (6) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that 
its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or 
interference and that either: 
(A) ?A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit 
directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(B) ?No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents 
from the user's prior discharge when the Town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES 
permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge or disposal 
requirements. 
(Ord. 99-041, § 2, passed 12-6-99) 


§ 51.13.03 - BYPASS. 
(A) ?For the purpose of this section, 
(1) ?"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's 
treatment facility. 
(2) ?"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the 
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss 
of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. 
Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(B) ?A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or 
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient 
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (C) and (D) of this section. 
(C) ?(1) ?If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the 
Superintendent, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2) ?A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds 
applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware 
of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the 
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the 
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the 
bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken 
or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent 
may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 
twenty-four (24) hours. 
(D) ?(1) ?Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user 
for a bypass, unless: 
(a) ?Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property 
damage; 
(b) ?There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment 
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of 
equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should 
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a 
bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive 
maintenance; and 
(c) ?The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C) of this section. 
(2) ?The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if 
the Superintendent determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection 
(D)(1) of this section.

    To ensure that the Town of Lexington adequately manages its water system during drought-related 
conditions, an organized plan is necessary for system operation and reliability, proper communications, 
effective coordination and ultimate allocation of water use. Prior planning will compliment the Town of 
Lexington's ability to respond to drought conditions and to enforce the enclosed ordinances. 
(A) ?Designation of Water System Drought Response Representation. Administrating a drought 
plan requires the skills needed to undertake a comprehensive public information program and 
the judgment required dealing with equality issues arising from enforcement of a mandatory 
program. The Drought Response Representative for the Town of Lexington is Mr. L.C. Greene, 
Town Administrator, Post Office Box 397, Lexington, South Carolina, 29071-0397, (803)951-
4633. 
(B) ?Description of Water Service Areas Water Sources and Capacities. The Town of Lexington is 
located in the Central Drought Response Management area of South Carolina. The water 
system services the central portion of Lexington County. The system has one large wholesale 
customer, Carolina Water Services. The Town of Lexington, through a wholesale agreement 
has the capability of pumping directly from the City of West Columbia clearwell at a maximum 
rate of 4.5 mgd. Their water supply is Lake Murray and the Saluda River. 
(C) ?Identification of Water System Specific Drought or Water Shortage Indicators: 
(1) ?Moderate Drought Phase. Average daily usage is greater than 2.5 mgd for thirty (30) 
consecutive days. 
(2) ?Severe Drought Phase. Average daily usage is greater than 2.8 mgd for fourteen (14) to 
twenty-one (21) consecutive days. 
(3) ?Extreme Drought Phase. Average daily usage is greater than 3.2 mgd for seven (7) to ten 
(10) consecutive days. 
(D) ?Cooperative Water Agreements. Successful drought management requires a comprehensive 
program by the water utility. In many situations administrative agreements are required with 
other agencies to fully implement the plan. The Town of Lexington identifies the following 
agreement with wholesalers that are in place to facilitate the implementation of this plan: 
(1) ?Water agreement between the Town of Lexington and Carolina Water Services. 
(E) ?Description of Predrought Planning Efforts. Before the occurrence of a water supply shortage 
and the need to implement the emergency provisions of this chapter, it is important that certain 
pre-response measures be taken with the aim of conserving the system's source water, as well 
as the water distributed to the customer. In regards to the conservation measures listed below, 
the Town of Lexington has taken the following actions: 
(1) ?Identification of all major water users of the system: Carolina Water Services, Cooper Air 
Tools, Inland Container, Safety Kleen, Lexington Medical Center and Lexington County 
Jail. 
(2) ?Identification of those users with whom there are conservation agreement: Carolina Water 
Services. 
(3) ?A vigorous public education program is critical for achieving substantial water use 
reductions. An effective public outreach program will keep the public informed about the 
water supply situation, what actions will mitigate drought emergency problems and how 
well the public is doing in terms of meeting the program goals. The Town of Lexington 
utilizes the public newspapers and local television stations to keep the public informed, 
about drought emergency problems. 
(F) ?Description of Capital Planning, Investing for System Reliability and Demand Forecasting. 
Updating the mapping of the water distribution system utilizing Auto Cad Mapping. Once this is 
close to completion, a long-term capital improvement program will be developed. This will 
enhance the Town's water distribution system to prepare for future droughts and increasing 
water demands. 
(Ord. 2003-32, passed 7-7-03) 


§ 52.04 - DROUGHT RESPONSE. 
    The objective of this section is to establish authority, policy and procedure by which the Town will 
take the proper actions to manage water demand during a drought-related shortage. This section satisfies 
the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000 and has the goal of achieving the greatest public 
benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use, sanitation, fire protection and of 
allocating water for other purposes in an equitable manner. This section outlines the actions to be taken 
for the conservation of water supplied by the Town. These actions are directed both towards an overall 
reduction in water usage and optimization of supply. To satisfy these goals the Town adopts the following 
regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water. This section is declared necessary 
for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare and shall take effect upon its adoption by the 
Town. If it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to drought, the Town is 
authorized to issue a proclamation that existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual water-use 
demands. The proclamation is an attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent that water 
use for consumption, sanitation, fire protection and other essential needs becomes endangered. 
Immediately upon issuance of such a proclamation, regulations and restrictions set forth under this 
section shall become effective and remain in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the 
proclamation rescinded. Water uses that are regulated and prohibited under this section are considered 
to be nonessential and continuation of such uses during times of water supply shortages is deemed to 
constitute a waste of water, subjecting the offender(s) to penalties. The Drought Management Plan as 
outlined in § 52.03 is approved. 
(A) ?Moderate Drought Phase. Upon notification by the Drought Response Committee that a 
moderate drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or upon determination by 
the Town that a moderate water supply shortage exists based on trigger levels, the Town will 
seek voluntary reductions from its customers in the use of water for purposes and voluntary 
reductions on using water during peak water demand periods. Specifically, the goal during this 
phase is to achieve a reduction of twenty percent (20%) in residential water use and fifteen 
percent (15%) in other water uses such as commercial, industrial, institutional and irrigation; 
and a reduction in overall water use of fifteen percent (15%). To accomplish this, the Town will 
take the following actions: 
(1) ?Issue a proclamation to be released to local media, to the Town's customers and to the 
South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center that 
Moderate drought conditions are present. 
(2) ?Provide written notification to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources 
Drought Information Center and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in 
the service area of the water system the voluntary conservation measures that the 
customers are requested to follow during Moderate drought conditions, including: 
(a) ?Reduce residential water use to sixty-five (65) gallons per person per day and a 
maximum of two hundred (200) gallons per household per day; 
(b) ?Eliminate the washing down of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, tennis 
courts and other hard surface areas;

repair one or more leaks and have failed to do so. 
(3) ?Intensify maintenance efforts to identify and correct water leaks in the distribution system. 
(4) ?Cease to install new irrigation taps on the water system. 
(5) ?Continue to encourage and educate customers to comply with voluntary water 
conservation. 
(B) ?Severe Drought Phase. Upon notification by the Drought Response Committee that a severe 
drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or upon determination by the Town 
that a severe water supply shortage exists based on trigger levels, the Town will seek voluntary 
reduction in the use of water for all purposes and mandatory restrictions on non-essential usage 
and restrictions on times when certain water usage is allowed. Specifically, the goal during this 
phase is to achieve a reduction of twenty-five percent (25%) in residential water use, twenty 
percent (20%) in all other water use categories and a reduction in overall water use of twenty 
percent (20%). To accomplish these goals, the Town will take the following actions:

proceeds derived from the sale of all prepared meals and beverages served by any establishment 
licensed for on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages, beer, or wine, and any restaurant, 
hotel, motel, or other food service facility within the Town of Lexington. In addition, the tax shall be 
imposed for all prepared meals and beverages prepared or modified by convenience stores or

all prepared meals and beverages prepared outside the Town Of Lexington, but delivered for 
consumption within The Town of Lexington.

items to which the tax applies and shall be collected by the provider or seller of the service, 
services or items. 
(2) ?The tax collected by the seller or provider of the services or items as required under subsection

the provider from making the required remittance. If any hospitality tax shall remain unpaid for 
sixty (60) days after its due date, a Uniform Ordinance Summons shall be prepared and served 
for the collection of the hospitality tax, and the cost of one hundred dollars ($100.00) will be

(4) ?The tax imposed by this ordinance must be remitted to the Town of Lexington on a monthly 
basis when the estimated amount of average tax is more than fifty dollars ($50.00) a month, on

CHAPTER 98 - TOBACCO AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS 
Section 


SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES AND PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT 


§ 98.01 - FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS. 
    Town Council (the "Council") of the Town of Lexington, South Carolina, hereby finds and determines: 
(A) ?The Town of Lexington, South Carolina (the "Town"), is an incorporated municipality located in 
Lexington County, South Carolina, and as such possesses all powers granted to municipalities 
by the Constitution and the laws of the State of South Carolina, including the powers 
enumerated in S.C. Code § 5-7-30 (2005 Supp) relating to regulating streets, markets, and 
public health. 
(B) ?Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, 
and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a 
cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, 
and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute has determined that secondhand smoke is 
responsible for the early deaths of up to sixty-five thousand (65,000) Americans annually. 
(National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: 
the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control 
Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
August 1999.) The Surgeon General has declared that: 
(1) ?Secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in nonsmokers exposed to 
smoke; 
(2) ?Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for sudden death 
syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more severe asthma; 
(3) ?Adults exposed to secondary smoke have a higher risk of coronary heart disease and lung 
cancer; 
(4) ?There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and 
(5) ?Separating smoking and nonsmoking sections of indoor areas does not sufficiently 
remove the threats of secondhand smoke in enclosed areas. 
(C) ?A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who 
work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five to fifty percent (25—50%) higher risk of 
heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as 
increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; 
Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., 
"Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute 
coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, 
September 2002.) 
(D) ?Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower 
productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and 
increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high 
price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(E) ?Certain outdoor events, such as parades, festivals, and other public gatherings, result in 
nonsmokers finding themselves in close proximity to persons who are smoking which can be 
reasonably seen to have the same effects of exposure as when nonsmokers are exposed to 
smoke in the same enclosed space. Lighted cigarettes, cigars, and pipes of people standing or 
sitting in close proximity have the potential of burning those with whom they inadvertently come 
into direct contact and making the air quality and peaceful enjoyment of outdoor events 
unreasonably restricted for nonsmokers. 
(F) ?When there is a presence of secondhand smoke in enclosed spaces or in outside areas where 
there is a public gathering resulting in people being in close proximity in places that are 
otherwise open to the public at large inevitably results in persons who do not smoke being 
forced to bear unwarranted health risks and inappropriate deprivation of peaceful enjoyment of 
the premises to which they have been invited or permitted to enter, even when steps have been 
taken to separate "smoking" and "nonsmoking" areas within the confined space. 
(G) ?The Town recognizes that smoke creates a danger to the health and safety of the public at 
large and that, in order to protect the health and welfare of the public, it is necessary to restrict 
smoking in the manner provided for in this article (the "article").

unless it is used as a childcare, adult day care, or health care facility. Nor is a private passenger motor 
vehicle a "place of employment" when used in the performance of employment responsibilities, provided it 
is not being used as public conveyance. 
    "Private club" means an organization, whether incorporated or not, which is the owner, lessee, or

annual meeting. The organization has established bylaws and/or a constitution to govern its activities. 
The organization has been granted an exemption from the payment of federal income tax as a club under

production and marketing establishments, retail service establishments, retail stores, shopping malls, 
theaters, waiting rooms, sports arenas, stadiums and ball parks. A private club is a "public place" when

primarily a bar or restaurant and which undertakes to make retail offerings of tobacco products as a 
means of circumventing the purposes of this article. 
    "Service line" means an indoor line in which one or more persons are waiting for or receiving service 
of any kind, whether or not the service involves the exchange of money. 
    "Shopping mall" means an enclosed public plaza, promenade, walkway, or hall area that serves to

    The business license levied by this chapter is for the purpose of providing such regulation as may be 
required by the business subject thereto and for the purpose of raising revenue for the general fund 
through a privilege tax. Each yearly license shall be issued for the twelve-month period of May 1 to April 
30. The provisions of this chapter and the rates herein shall remain in effect from year to year as 
amended by Town Council.

requiring the highest rate. A license tax based on gross income shall be computed on the gross 
income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year, and on a twelve-month projected income based on 
the monthly average for a business in operation for less than one year. The tax for a new business 
shall be computed on the estimated probable gross income stated in the license application for the 
balance of the license year. The initial tax for an annexed business shall be prorated for the number 
of months remaining in the license year. No refund shall be made for a business that is discontinued. 
(Ord. 2018-38 , § 1(Att. I), passed 12-3-18)

business license prior to operation within the Town, and an annexed business shall be required to 
have a business license within thirty (30) days of the annexation. A license for a bar (NAICS 722410) 
must be issued in the name of the individual who has been issued a State alcohol, beer or wine 
permit or license and will have actual control and management of the business. 
(B) ?Application shall be on a form provided by the License Official which shall contain the Social 
Security Number and/or the Federal Employer's Identification Number, the business name as 
reported on the South Carolina income tax return, and all information about the applicant and the

satisfactory records and proof. 
(B) ?No person shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter by reason of the lack of an 
established place of business within the Town, unless exempted by State or Federal law. The

relieved of the liability for the payment of any other tax or fee by reason of the application of this 
chapter. 
(C) ?A Charitable Organization shall be exempt from the business license tax on its gross income unless 
it is deemed a business subject to a business license tax on all or part of its gross income as 
provided in this section. A Charitable Organization, or any for-profit affiliate of a Charitable 
Organization, that reports income from for-profit activities, or unrelated business income, for Federal 
income tax purposes to the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed a business subject to a 
business license tax on the part of its gross income from such for-profit activities or unrelated 
business income. 
    A Charitable Organization shall be deemed a business subject to a business license tax on its gross 
income if (1) any net proceeds of operation, after necessary expenses of operation, inure to the benefit of 
any individual or any entity that is not itself a Charitable Organization as defined in this chapter, or (2) any

market value to a sponsor, organizer, officer, director, trustee, or person with ultimate control of the 
organization shall not be deemed a necessary expense of operation.

readily available for inspection by any authorized agent of the Town. Service vehicles operating 
within the Town are subject to the provisions of Section 23 of this chapter. 
(B) ?A change of address must be reported to the License Official within ten (10) days after removal of 
the business to a new location and the license will be valid at the new address upon written 
notification of the License Official and compliance with zoning and building codes. Failure to obtain 
the approval of the License Official for a change of address shall invalidate the license and subject 
the licensee to prosecution for doing business without a license. A business license shall not be 
transferable and a transfer of controlling interest shall be considered a termination of the old 
business and the establishment of a new business requiring a new business license, based on old 
business income.

agent of the Town is empowered to enter upon the premises of any person subject to this chapter to

or refuse to make available the necessary books and records. In the event an audit or inspection 
reveals that the licensee has filed false information, the costs of the audit shall be added to the 
correct license tax and late penalties in addition to other penalties provided in this chapter. Each day 
of failure to pay the proper amount of license tax shall constitute a separate offense. 
(B) ?The License Official shall have the authority to make inspections and conduct audits of businesses 
within the Town to insure compliance with this chapter. Financial information obtained by inspections 
and audits shall not be deemed public records, and the License Official shall not release the amount 
of license taxes paid or the reported gross income of any person by name without permission of the 
licensee, except as authorized by this chapter, State or Federal law, or proper judicial order. 
Statistics compiled by classifications are public records.

§ 111.11 - ASSESSMENTS; PAYMENT UNDER PROTEST; APPEAL.

surveys as the License Official may deem appropriate to assess a license tax and penalties as 
provided in this chapter.

adjustment of the assessment may be made to the License Official within five (5) days after the

notice of final assessment. 
(C) ?A final assessment may be appealed to Town Council only by payment in full of the assessment 
under protest within five (5) days and the filing of written notice of appeal within ten (10) days after 
payment pursuant to the provisions of this chapter relating to appeals to Town Council.

collect a late penalty of five percent (5%) of the unpaid tax for each month or portion thereof after the

days after its due date, the License Official shall report it to the municipal attorney or police for 
appropriate legal action.

paid; provided, however, no business license shall be issued or renewed until the full amount of the

A trailer at the construction site, or structure in which the contractor temporarily resides, is not a 
permanent place of business under this chapter. 
For nonresident contractors, the total fee for the full amount of the contract for work that requires the 
issuance of a building, zoning or other permit shall be paid prior to commencement of work and shall 
entitle the contractor to complete the job without regard to the normal license expiration date. An 
amended report shall be filed for each new job requiring a permit and the appropriate additional license 
fee per one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) of the contract amount shall be paid prior to commencement of 
the new work. For work which does not require the issuance of a permit, an annual license shall be 
obtained with the fee computed upon the gross income for such work for the preceding calendar or fiscal 
year, and on a twelve-month projected gross income based on the monthly average for a business in 
operation for less than one year. The fee for a new business shall be computed on the estimated 
probable gross income stated in the license application for the balance of the license year. Only one base 
fee shall be paid in a calendar year. 
No contractor shall be issued a business license until all state and municipal qualification examination 
and trade license requirements have been met. Each contractor shall post a sign in plain view on each 
job identifying the contractor with the job. 
No contractor shall be issued a business license until all performance and indemnity bonds required by 
the Building Code have been filed and approved. Zoning permits must be obtained when required by the 
Zoning Ordinance. 
Each prime contractor shall file with the License Official a list of subcontractors furnishing labor or 
materials for each project.

DESIGN GUIDELINES 


§ 152.02.22 - INTENT. 
    It is the intent of §§ 152.02.01 through 152.02.24 to ensure, insofar as possible, that historic 
properties in a designated historic district shall be in harmony with the architectural and historical 
character of the Town of Lexington. In granting a certificate of appropriateness, the Board shall take into 
account the architectural and historical significance of the structure under consideration and the exterior 
form and appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that structure as well as the effect of 
such change or additions upon other structures in the vicinity. 
(Ord. 99-013, § 1 (§ 5-1.0), passed 4-5-99) 


§ 152.02.23 - THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR'S STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION. 
(A) ?When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness for new construction, alteration, 
repair or restoration, the Board shall use the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation 
as guidelines in making its decisions. In addition, the Board may adopt more specific guidelines for 
local historic districts and local historic buildings. These guidelines serve as the basis for determining 
the approval, approval with modifications or denial of an application. 
(B) ?The Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation are: 
(1) ?A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal 
change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces and spatial relationships. 
(2) ?The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive 
materials or alteration of features, spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property 
will be avoided. 
(3) ?Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that 
create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements 
from other buildings, will not be undertaken. 
(4) ?Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained 
and preserved. 
(5) ?Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of 
craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved. 
(6) ?Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of 
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in 
design, color, texture and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be 
substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
(7) ?Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means 
possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
(8) ?Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be 
disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. 
(9) ?New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction will not destroy historic 
materials, features and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be 
differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale 
and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10) ?New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner 
that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its 
environment would be unimpaired. 
(Ord. 99-013, § 1 (§ 5-2.0), passed 4-5-99) 


APPEALS

    "Street" means, relates to, and includes the entire right-of-way of streets, avenues, boulevards, 
roads, highway, freeways, lanes, alleys, courts, thoroughfares, collectors, minor streets, cul-de-sacs and 
other ways. 
    Street classifications. Streets may be classified as follows: 
(1) ?"Alley" means a public or private right-of-way primarily designed to serve as secondary access 
to the side or rear of those properties whose principal frontage is on some other street. 
(2) ?"Arterial (major thoroughfare)" means a freeway, expressway or a street or highway which is 
used or intended to be used for moving either heavy vehicular traffic volumes or high-speed 
traffic, or both, or which was designated as a major thoroughfare in the comprehensive plan. 
(3) ?"Collector" means a street which is used or intended to be used for moving traffic from minor 
streets to major thoroughfares, including the principal entrance and circulation street or streets 
of a development. Types of collector streets include: 
(a) ?Urban residential: Collector streets which serve minor urban residential streets; 
(b) ?Rural residential: Collector streets which serve only minor rural residential lots which meet 
the lot size requirements of a minor residential street; 
(c) ?Commercial or industrial: Collector streets that serve minor commercial or industrial 
streets. 
(4) ?"Local (minor street)" means a street that is used or intended to be used to provide access to 
other streets from individual properties. Types of minor streets include: 
(a) ?Urban residential: Minor streets serving residential lots in incorporated areas; 
(b) ?Rural residential: Minor streets serving residential lots; 
(c) ?Commercial or industrial: Minor streets serving commercial or industrial uses; 
(d) ?Marginal access: Minor streets located parallel and adjacent to a limited access street or 
highway which provide access to abutting properties and protection from through traffic; 
(e) ?Cul-de-sac: Minor street with only one outlet and having an appropriate terminal for the 
safe and convenient reversal of traffic movement. 
(5) ?Private streets. Private streets shall not be permitted in the Town of Lexington for the purpose 
of subdivision. Exception: Streets existing prior to the adoption of this chapter shall be 
grandfathered and shall continue to be maintained by their owners and not by the Town of 
Lexington. However, in the event that property accessed by a private street is to be developed, 
that street shall be brought up to standard and dedicated as a public street. 
    "Street perimeter" means any existing street to which the parcel of land to be subdivided abuts one 
side. 
    "Subdivider" means any person who: 
(1) ?Having an interest in land causes it, directly or indirectly, to be divided into a subdivision; or 
(2) ?Directly or indirectly, sells, leases or develops or offers to sell, lease or develop, or advertises 
for sale, lease or development, any interest, lot, parcel site, unit or plat in a subdivision; or 
(3) ?Engages directly or through an agent, in the business of selling, leasing, developing or offering 
for sale, lease or development, a subdivision or any interest, lot, parcel site, unit or plat in a 
subdivision; and 
(4) ?Is directly or indirectly controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control, with any of the 
foregoing. 
    "Subdivision" means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots, building sites or 
other divisions. The land is divided for sale, lease or building development, whether immediately or in the 
future. This includes all land divisions involving a new street or change in existing streets. It includes 
resubdivisions involving the further division or relocation of lot lines of any lot or lots within a previously 
approved or recorded subdivision. This covers the alteration of any streets or the establishment of any 
new streets within any previously approved or recorded subdivision as well as combinations of lots of 
record. The following exceptions are included within this definition only for the purpose of requiring that 
the local planning agency be informed and have a record of the subdivisions: 
(1) ?Combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of 
lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the ordinance standards; 
(2) ?Dividing land into parcels of five (5) acres or more where no new street is involved. The 
Planning Commission must receive plats of these exceptions as information and indicate that 
fact on the plats; 
(3) ?Combination or recombining entire lots of record where no new street or change in existing 
streets is involved. 
Subdivision types. 
(1) ?"Conservation subdivision" means a residential development where fifty percent (50%) or more 
of the developable land area is designated as undivided, permanent open space; thereby 
permanently protecting agriculturally, environmentally or historically significant areas within the 
parcel. The remaining developable land is subdivided into buildable lots. 
(2) ?"Nonresidential subdivision" means a subdivision whose intended use is other than residential, 
such as commercial or industrial. Such subdivision shall comply with the applicable provisions 
of these regulations. 
(3) ?Planned development. The intent of the planned development is to better bridge the inherent 
difference between residential and nonresidential uses; and to better accommodate change 
within those areas of the Town of Lexington where due to economics or other factors 
responsible for change, potentially incompatible development could compromise property 
values or adversely impact existing land use, transportation facilities, or infrastructure. 
Through the planned development advocated by these regulations, it is possible to ameliorate 
differences between potentially incompatible uses by exacting concessions and conditions as 
necessary to achieve "land use compatibility." One popular version of a PD is the neo-traditional 
neighborhood development. 
(4) ?"Traditional subdivision" means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots, 
building sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy or 
building development, and includes all division of land involving a new street or a change in 
existing streets, and includes resubdivision and, where appropriate, the process of subdivision 
or the land or area subdivided; provided, however, that the following exceptions are included 
within this definition only for the purpose of requiring that an application for exemption be filed 
with the Administrative Official. 
(a) ?All exceptions stated in the definition of subdivision. 
    "Townhouse or townhome" means one of a series of three (3) or more attached one-family dwelling 
units on separate lots that: 
(1) ?May or may not have a common roof; 
(2) ?Share a common exterior wall; and 
(3) ?May share and own in common the surrounding grounds. 
Prior to the approval of any townhouse project, the legal declaration establishing the ownership 
association shall be submitted to the Approving Authority for approval by the Town Attorney as to form 
and legal sufficiency, and the declarations shall require the association to provide exterior building 
maintenance services and architectural control. 
    "Use" means the purpose or activity for which a piece of land or its buildings is designed, arranged or 
intended, or for which it is occupied or maintained.

(2) ?Review of traffic impact study (if applicable), and review of sketch plan; 
(3) ?Review and approval of preliminary plat, and 
(4) ?Review and approval of final plat. 
(B) ?Steps (A)(1) through (3) shall be completed prior to making any street improvements and installing 
any utilities. Step (A)(4) shall be completed prior to sale of any lots recording any portion of the plat 
of the proposed subdivision, or issuance of a building permit for construction of buildings, except as 
provided in these regulations. 
(Ord. 99-021, passed 6-7-99) 


§ 154.03.02 - PROCEDURES. 
    The following procedures shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision 
plats. 
(Ord. 99-021, passed 6-7-99) 


§ 154.03.03 - SKETCH PLAN. 
(A) ?Discussion of requirements. Before preparing the sketch plan for a subdivision, the applicant should 
discuss with the Administrative Official the procedure for adoption of a subdivision plat and the 
requirements as to general layout of streets and for reservations of land, street improvements, 
drainage, sewerage, fire protection, extraordinary development (Article 9) and other similar matters, 
as well as the availability of existing services. The Administrative Official shall also advise the 
applicant, where appropriate, to discuss the proposed subdivision with those officials who must 
eventually approve these aspects of the subdivision plat coming within their jurisdiction. 
(B) ?Application procedure and requirements. Prior to subdividing land, an owner of the land, or his 
representative, shall file an application for approval of a sketch plan. The application shall: 
(1) ?Be made on forms available at the office of the Administrative Official. 
(2) ?Include all contiguous holdings of the owner including land in the same ownership, as defined 
herein, with an indication of the portion that is proposed to be subdivided, accompanied by an 
affidavit of ownership. 
(3) ?Be accompanied by a minimum of seven (7) copies of the sketch plan as described in these 
regulations and complying in all respects with these regulations.

plan to the Planning Commission for approval. The Planning Commission shall review the sketch 
plan at the meeting in which it is submitted and act on the submission with pertinent comments and 
recommendations noted in the minutes of the meeting. The Planning Commission shall advise the 
applicant within sixty (60) days after application that the sketch plan is approved, disapproved or 
approved with certain modifications. If approved, said approval shall constitute authorization to 
prepare and submit a preliminary plat. Approval does not authorize the developer to begin 
construction or improvements. If the Planning Commission fails to act on the sketch plan within sixty 
(60) days after application, the sketch plan shall be deemed approved and a certificate to that effect 
shall be issued by the Planning Commission upon demand; provided however, that the subdivider 
may waive this requirement and consent in writing to extension of such period. 
(D) ?Appeals from the Planning Commission. Any appeal to the circuit court or any request for 
prelitigation mediation must be filed with the circuit court within thirty (30) days after actual notice of

demand; provided, however, that the applicant for Planning Commission's approval may waive 
this requirement and consent in writing to an extension of such period. The grounds of 
disapproval of any preliminary plat shall be stated in the records of the Planning Commission. 
(3) ?It is expressly understood that the Planning Commission shall not act to override the

Official to the Planning Commission on authorization by the Planning Commission. Also noted 
shall be the date on which the Planning Commission granted approval and the date of written 
notification to the subdivider or his authorized agent. Approval of a preliminary subdivision plot 
shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plot. Application for approval of the final 
(record) plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified 
herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval 
of the preliminary subdivision plat by the Planning Commission, the subdivider may proceed 
with compliance of the other requirements of these regulations, construction of proposed 
improvements, and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. 
(C) ?Effective period of preliminary approval. The approval of preliminary plat shall be effective for a 
period of two (2) years at the end of which time final approval on the subdivision must have been 
obtained from the Planning Commission although the plat need not yet be signed and filed with the 
Registrar of Deeds. Any plat not receiving final approval within the period of time set forth therein 
shall be required to resubmit a new plat for preliminary approval subject to all new land development 
regulations. 
(D) ?Model homes. For the purpose of allowing the early construction of model homes in a subdivision, 
the Planning Commission at its discretion may permit a portion of a subdivision involving not more 
than two (2) lots to be created in accordance with the procedures for exempted subdivisions, 
provided said portion derives access from an existing city, county or state highway, and provided no 
future road or other improvement is anticipated where said lots are proposed. Subsequent to 
approval of exemption, the model may be constructed, subject to such additional requirements that 
the Planning Commission may require.

(C) ?A site evaluation of the development, including a soil survey and interpretations conducted or 
approved by the County Soil and Water Conservation District as described herein, shall be 
submitted as an integral component of the sketch plan. 
(1) ?The developer of the subdivision shall apply to the Soil and Water Conservation District to 
do the required site evaluation and soil survey and interpretations. If the staff of the 
Conservation District determines that it cannot perform the site evaluation within thirty (30) 
days of the application, then the developer may contract with a registered engineer, 
landscape architect or professional soil conservationist to perform the site evaluation. This 
site evaluation must then be submitted to the staff of the Conservation District for approval. 
The staff shall review the site evaluation within fifteen (15) days of its submission. 
    It is suggested that the subdivider obtain a site evaluation, including a soil survey and interpretations, 
and use it as an aid in the development of his sketch plan.

passed 10-3-05) 


MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS 


§ 154.05.01 - GENERAL. 
    In considering any preliminary plat, the Planning Commission shall give consideration to any 
comprehensive plan, or segments thereof, affecting the area in which the subdivision is located. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 5-1), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.05.02 - STREETS. 
    All streets, which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a subdivision, 
shall comply with the design standards of the South Carolina Department of Transportation and the Town 
and County of Lexington. Should the County not accept the new street or road, the following requirements 
will apply: 
(A) ?The layout of the streets as to arrangement, character, width, grade and location may be 
required to conform to the Town's master plan, official map, comprehensive plan, to adjoining 
street systems or adjoining properties, and to the topography, natural features and drainage 
systems provided. Streets constructed in a gas or electrical transmission line right-of-way will 
not be platted or dedicated as a public street. Exception: A street constructed to cross the right-
of-way at no more than forty-five (45) degrees from perpendicular, as permitted by the utility 
company, may be platted and dedicated as a public street. 
The Planning Commission may also grant exceptions as permitted by the utility company 
providing that all of the following pertain: 
(1) ?There exists no reasonable alternative to placement of the street within the power line 
easement and that without an exception, the developer will suffer substantial financial 
hardship; and 
(2) ?An alternative means of ingress and egress is available in the event of an emergency. 
Provided, however, the Planning Commission may grant exceptions to this requirement if it 
is determined that the entire tract under consideration cannot be developed without such 
exception; and 
(3) ?The developer agrees to post sufficient security to reimburse the Town of Lexington for 
expenses incurred by the Town to repair streets and appurtenances damaged by any work 
of the utility because of maintenance and repair in connection with the transmission line 
easement. 
(B) ?Minor streets shall be so laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged, but to 
encourage use by local traffic. 
(C) ?Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed collector or through street, the 
Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen 
planting, deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of 
residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(D) ?Roads of an existing subdivision shall not be used as the sole means of ingress and egress in 
developing a new subdivision or extending an existing one unless granted by the Planning 
Commission. If, in judgment of the Planning Commission, the increased traffic and noise would 
create a safety hazard or otherwise be detrimental to residents of the existing subdivision, 
additional access shall be provided. 
(E) ?Continuation of existing street pattern. Whenever topography will permit, the arrangements of 
streets in a subdivision shall provide for the alignment and continuation or projection of existing 
streets in adjoining areas. This is to mean the interconnectivity of subdivision developments. 
(F) ?Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-
way of at least one hundred feet (100') in a diameter and a paved turnaround with a minimum 
out side diameter eighty feet (80') or other approved type of turnaround. Maximum length shall 
not exceed eight hundred feet (800') unless unusual circumstances require a greater length. 
(G) ?Temporary dead-end streets. Temporary dead-end streets, which extend for a greater distance 
than the depth of one abutting lot, shall be provided with a temporary turnaround having a 
diameter of eighty feet (80'), or other suitable turnaround. 
(H) ?Half Streets. Half streets are prohibited along property lines. Whenever a street is planned 
adjacent to the proposed subdivision tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be 
platted within the proposed subdivision. 
(I) ?Intersections. The centerline of no more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point. 
Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street 
shall intersect any other street at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees (angles of intersection 
to be measured at the intersection of street centerline). Curved streets shall have a minimum 
tangent of one hundred feet (100') at intersections. 
(J) ?Reverse curves. Where practical, a tangent of at least two hundred feet (200') on minor streets 
and three hundred feet (300') on collector streets shall be provided between reverse curves. On 
major thoroughfares, tangent distances shall be determined by the State Highway Department. 
(K) ?Street access. Where it is essential to the development of a logical street pattern, street right-
of-way shall be extended to the boundary of adjoining property. Incompatible characteristics of 
adjoining property shall be given due consideration in making a determination of what shall 
constitute a logical street pattern. Each residential collector road shall have either: 
(a) ?Two (2) or more access points to roads of equal or higher classification; or 
(b) ?Substantial improvement, satisfactory to the Town Engineer, to accommodate projected 
traffic flow, i.e., acceleration/deceleration lanes, stop lights, etc. 
(L) ?Street jogs. Street jogs should be avoided. Where unavoidable, street jogs at intersections 
shall have a centerline offset of not less than one hundred fifty feet (150'). 
(M) ?Street names. Streets that are extensions of, or obviously in alignment with existing named 
streets, shall bear that name. The name of new streets shall be subject to the approval of the 
Town Planning Commission and shall not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names in 
Lexington County, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, circle, way, boulevard, 
drive, place or court or the like. 
(N) ?Additional right-of-way. Subdivisions which include an existing platted street that does not 
conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements of these regulations shall provide additional 
width along one or both sides of such street so that the minimum right-of-way required by these 
regulations is established. Subdivisions abutting only one side of such street shall provide a 
minimum of one-half (½), measured from the centerline of the existing right-of-way, of the right-
of-way required by these regulations. 
(O) ?Right-of-way and pavement widths. Minimum right-of-way and pavement widths shall be as

(2) ?Low point of the valley to low point of the valley. 
** ?As shown on the major thoroughfare plan. Right-of-way usually reserved or dedicated by 
subdivider and improved by others. 
(P) ?Street grades. Grades on major thoroughfares shall be established by the State Highway 
Department. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed eight percent (8%) unless topographic 
conditions make this impractical. Grades on minor residential streets shall not exceed fifteen 
percent (15%). All streets shall have a minimum grade of not less than one-half percent (.5%). 
(Q) ?Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten (10) degrees occurs in the 
alignment of a minor street, a curve of reasonable radius shall be introduced. A curve shall be 
introduced at any change in direction of a collector street or major thoroughfare. On major 
thoroughfares, the centerline radius of a curvature shall be determined by the State Highway 
Department. On collector streets the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than three 
hundred fifty feet (350'). On minor streets, the centerline radius of a curvature shall not be less 
than one hundred fifty feet (150'). 
(R) ?Vertical curves. Minimum stopping sight distance on major thoroughfares shall be determined 
by the State Highway Department. On collector streets minimum stopping sight distance shall 
be two hundred seventy-five feet (275') (forty (40) mph), and on minor streets one hundred sixty 
feet (160') (twenty-five (25) mph). Stopping sight distances shall be measured from height of 
eye of three feet (3') nine inches (9") to an object with a height of six inches (6"). Both distances 
measured above the centerline of the street. Stopping sight distances shall conform to the 
standards of the American Association of State Highway Officials. 
(S) ?Split level streets. Streets which are constructed so as to have two (2) traffic ways, each at 
different levels within the same right-of-way, shall provide a paved traffic surface of at least 
twenty feet (20') on each level and a slope between the two (2) traffic ways of three to one (3:1) 
or flatter. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 5-2), passed 2-1-99; Am. Ord. 99-021, passed 6-7-99; Ord. 2003-04, § 1, 
passed 1-6-03; Ord. 2005-66, § 1, passed 12-5-05) 


§ 154.05.03 - BLOCKS. 
    The Planning Commission shall examine every proposed subdivision as to its compliance with the 
following provisions: 
(A) ?Nonresidential blocks. Nonresidential blocks shall be of such length and width as may be 
suitable for their prospective use, including adequate provision for off-street parking and 
service. 
(B) ?Residential block length. In order to insure convenient access between various parts of a 
subdivision and between the subdivision and surrounding areas, and in order to help prevent 
traffic congestion and undue inconvenience, the length of residential blocks hereafter shall not 
exceed one thousand feet (1,000') or be less than two hundred feet (200') from corner to corner. 
Provided, however, such length requirements may be modified when such shall be appropriate 
due to the topography or physical shape of the property being subdivided. The width of any 
residential block shall be sufficient to permit two (2) tiers of lots, where topography and land 
ownership permits, except as otherwise provided in these regulations. 
(C) ?Crosswalks. Where a subdivision design involves unusually long blocks, public right-of-way for 
pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided where such are necessary for the convenience of 
pedestrians. Such right-of-way shall not be less than ten feet (10') wide and improved to include 
a concrete, asphalt or other approved surface sidewalks four feet (4') wide and four inches (4") 
thick. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 5-3), passed 2-1-99; Am. Ord. 99-021, passed 6-7-99) 


§ 154.05.04 - LOTS. 
    All lots, which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a subdivision, 
shall comply with the requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance of the Town of Lexington, South 
Carolina, or as shown below, whichever are more restrictive. 
(A) ?Authority of Health Department. Nothing contained in these regulations shall be construed as 
preventing the Health Department, after study of the conditions existing in a proposed 
subdivision, from requiring that all or any portion of the area of such subdivision shall not be 
built upon or that the minimum lot sizes set forth in these regulations are inadequate and must 
be increased to insure the protection of the public health. 
(B) ?Setback lines—Residential. Building setback lines shall be in accordance with the zoning 
ordinance. Minimum side and rear setback lines shall also be in accordance with the zoning 
ordinance. Driveways shall be at least four feet (4') from the property line except at the point of 
entry and exit. 
(C) ?Lot lines and Town limit or County lines. Insofar as practical, lots should not be divided by 
Town Limit or County boundary lines. 
(D) ?Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and 
radial to curved street lines. 
(E) ?Minimum lot dimensions and area. The minimum lot width at the front building line and 
minimum lot area shall be designed in the Town of Lexington zoning ordinance. 
(F) ?Corner lots. 
(1) ?Corner lots shall be at least five feet (5') wider than interior lots; provided however, the 
maximum required width of corner lots shall be one hundred feet (100'). 
(2) ?The minimum side building setback distances shall be at least the minimum front building 
setback distance for the side adjacent to the street. 
(G) ?Double frontage. Double frontage lots (i.e., lots having street frontage both in front and rear) 
shall be avoided except in commercial zones, where essential to provide separation of 
residential development from railroad or major street right-of-way or from nonresidential uses or 
where necessary due to topography. Where a railroad or major thoroughfare right-of-way, as 
shown on the major thoroughfare plan, abuts or runs through any portion of the subdivision, the 
subdivision plat shall provide for either a minor street or lots backing onto the right-of-way 
having a minimum depth of two hundred feet (200'). 
(H) ?Street access. Every lot hereafter established shall front or abut on a public street that 
conforms to the requirements of these regulations. 
Exception: Commercial lots in the IDD district may front on a private road if all of the following 
conditions are met: 
(1) ?The design and construction of the private road have been approved by the Director of 
Engineering and Planning. 
(2) ?A legal document is prepared to the satisfaction of the Director of Engineering and 
Planning and recorded in the County Register of Deeds stating how the private road is to 
be maintained and the entity responsible for maintaining the road. 
(3) ?Access to the private road is limited to commercial activities and does not extend to 
residential development. 
(4) ?The project receives Planning Commission approval. 
(I) ?Flag Lots. The use of flag lots in residential subdivisions shall be permitted only if dictated by 
the terrain. Flat lots shall not be permitted to solely allow an increase in the number of lots. The 
access drive to a flag lot shall have a minimum width of thirty feet (30') and shall be a deeded 
part of the lot so accessed. No two (2) flag lots may abut or converge at the (poles) street right-
of-way. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 5-4), passed 2-1-99; Ord. 2000-43, § 1, passed 12-4-00) 


§ 154.05.05 - EASEMENTS. 
    Easements shall be required in subdivisions for the following purposes: 
(A) ?Utility easements. When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in 
other than street right-of-way, easements shall be shown on the plat for such purposes. All 
above ground utilities shall be provided along rear property lines except where site conditions 
make this impractical. Such easements shall be not less than twenty feet (20') along rear 
property lines and ten feet (10') alongside property line and, where possible, shall be centered 
on rear and side lot lines. 
(B) ?Water course and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a water 
course, drainage way or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate storm 
water and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. The area so improved shall 
conform substantially with the lines of such water course and be of a sufficient width for 
construction, or both, as to be adequate for the purpose; provided however, such public 
easement shall be not less than twelve feet (12') in width. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 5-5), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.05.06 - RESERVATION OF PUBLIC SITES. 
    To insure the orderly development of the community, the subdivider shall be required to reserve and

CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DESIGN 


§ 154.09.01 - PURPOSE. 
    It is the intent of §§ 154.09.01 through 154.09.07 to allow development that will meet future growth 
projections while preserving and protecting agriculturally, environmentally and historically significant 
features of the Town and County. In seeking to achieve this and the goals defined in the Town of 
Lexington comprehensive plan the purpose of §§ 154.09.01 through 154.09.07 shall be to: 
(A) ?Complement the environmental, agricultural, and historical preservation goals outlined in the 
Town's comprehensive plan and historic preservation ordinance, §§ 152.02.01 through 
152.02.24; 
(B) ?Preserve the unique agricultural character of the Town and County; 
(C) ?Permit reasonable development that is in accordance with the principles of open space 
conservation; 
(D) ?Accommodate the development of sustainable communities while protecting and preserving 
areas of agricultural, environmental and historic significance; 
(E) ?Maintain separation of noncompatible land uses; 
(F) ?Preserve the scenic and natural character of the Town and County; 
(G) ?Create an interconnected network of open space that promotes livable, sustainable subdivision 
development and wildlife habitat and corridors; 
(H) ?Economize in the installation of infrastructure and the provision of public services. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 9-1), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.09.02 - DEFINITION OF TERMS. 
    For the purpose of §§ 154.09.01 through 154.09.07, certain terms and words are defined as follows: 
    "Agriculturally significant" means generally, any land with an average corn suitability rating (CSR) of 
sixty-five (65) or higher is considered prime agricultural land and, therefore, deemed to be agriculturally 
significant for the purpose of §§ 154.09.01 through 154.09.07. 
    "Clustering" means a subdivision design method that concentrates development in specific areas on 
the proposed site. The purpose of clustering is to allow increased density on a portion of the parcel, while 
preserving the rest as permanent open space. The density of the entire parcel will not exceed the original 
density of the parcel, the houses will just be grouped together in one or more areas on the parcel, unless 
a density bonus is granted by the Planning Commission, which will allow increased building density on 
the parcel. The concept of clustering provides for a flexibility in subdivision design that fits the natural 
characteristics of the land and permits more usable open space and the preservation of prime agricultural 
land and land containing one or more sensitive area. 
    "Conservation subdivision design" means a residential development where fifty percent (50%) or 
more of the developable land area is designated as undivided, permanent open space; thereby 
permanently protecting agriculturally, environmentally or historically significant areas within the parcel. 
The remaining developable land is subdivided into buildable lots. 
    "Corn suitability rating" means the suitability of a soil is determined by a number of characteristics 
including: soil quality, growing season and moisture. A ranking is then assigned to the area. 
    "Developer/ applicant" means the one proposing to undertake the action. 
    "Environmentally significant" means any tract of land that contains one or more of the following 
sensitive areas as defined by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources: critical wildlife 
habitats, erodible land, flood hazard areas, natural prairies, stream corridors, wetlands or woodlands, or 
that contains a scenic natural area. 
    "Historically significant" means any tract of land that contains an archaeological or historical resource 
as defined by the historic preservation ordinance, §§ 152.02.01 through 152.02.24, of the Town of 
Lexington, the Office of State Archaeologist of South Carolina and/or the South Carolina Department of 
Archives and History, or that is considered by the State Historic Preservation Officer to be eligible for the 
National Register of Historic Places is defined as historically significant. In addition, any contiguous 
pieces of property of no greater area than one hundred sixty (160) acres under diverse ownership which: 
(1) ?Are significant in American history, architecture, archaeology and culture; and 
(2) ?Possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, skill, feeling and association; and 
(3) ?Are associated with events that have been a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our 
history; or 
(4) ?Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or 
(5) ?Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, method of construction, represent the 
work of a master, possess high artistic values, represent a significant and distinguishable entity 
whose components may lack individual distinction; or 
(6) ?Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to prehistory or history. 
    "Hydric soils" means soils susceptible to saturation by water, as defined by the USDA Natural 
Resources Conservation Service. 
    "Scenic natural areas" means any tract of land which contains a unique feature of the rural 
landscape including, but not limited to, large rock formations, hill crests, mature tree stands, and/or any 
other feature deemed to be significant by the Town of Lexington Planning Commission. 
    "Sensitive areas" means areas containing one or more of the following unique or locally significant 
resources: archaeological resources, critical wildlife habitats, erodible land, flood hazard areas, natural 
prairies, stream corridors, wetlands or woodlands. 
    "Site map" means a document identifying: location of the parcel, legal description of the parcel, 
proposed area of development, potential sensitive areas, septic provisions and topography of the parcel. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 9-2), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.09.03 - AREAS. 
    Those areas deemed to be of agricultural, environmental or historical significance, as defined above, 
shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be referred to as "significant." The specific characteristics of these 
areas are defined as follows: 
(A) ?"Agricultural land" means any land used to produce food and/or fiber, including, but not limited 
to, the production of row crops, small grains, forages, animals and timber. Land not devoted to 
urban uses, wildlife sanctuaries or a native ecosystem is considered agricultural land. 
(1) ?"Prime agricultural land" means land with the best combination of physical and chemical 
characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber and oilseed crops, and which is 
available for these uses. These characteristics include soil quality, growing season and 
moisture sufficient to sustain high yield crops when managed according to acceptable 
farming methods. The key indicator for prime agricultural land is an average corn suitability 
rating (CSR) of sixty-five (65) or higher. 
(B) ?"Agriculturally significant area" means any tract of land which is considered prime agricultural 
land with a CSR of sixty-five (65) or higher. 
(C) ?"Archaeological or historic resource (known)" means areas containing important information 
regarding the history or prehistory of the United States of America, the State of South Carolina, 
Lexington County, and/or the Town of Lexington. Areas containing suspected archaeologically 
or historically significant resources will be subject to review by the office of the State 
Archaeologist of South Carolina, the South Carolina Historical Society, and/or the Lexington 
County Historic Preservation Society. 
(1) ?Object. Distinguished from buildings and structures, constructions that are primarily artistic 
in nature or are relatively small in scale. These items also must bear an association with a 
specific location, setting or environment. Objects include, but are not limited to, fountains, 
boundary markers, sculptures, monuments and statuary. 
(2) ?Site. The location of a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or 
structure, standing, ruined or vanished, where the location possesses historic, cultural or 
archaeological value. Sites include, but are not limited to, battlefields, campsites,

threatened species including but not limited to, food sources and cover. 
(E) ?"Erodible lands" means areas of incline, whether natural or man-made, lacking sufficient 
vegetation to prevent instability, erosion or downstream siltation. The key indicator for erodible 
lands is a slope of five percent (5%) or greater. Areas with a five percent (5%) slope or greater 
are subject to review by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The 
NRCS will make the final determination regarding the area's erodability. 
(F) ?Environmentally significant area. 
(G) ?"Flood hazard area" means areas at high risk of inundation by water as a result of a flood. 
Known areas of flood hazard are indicated on the flood insurance rate map.

Office of the State Archaeologist of South Carolina and/or the South Carolina Department of 
Archives and History, or that is considered by the State Historic Preservation officer to be 
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, historical significance is defined 
as: contiguous pieces of property of no greater area than one hundred sixty (160) acres under 
diverse ownership which: 
(1) ?Are significant in American history, architecture, archaeology and culture; and 
(2) ?Possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, skill, feeling and association; and

history; or 
(4) ?Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or 
(5) ?Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, method of construction, represent the 
work of a master, possess high artistic values, represent a significant and distinguishable entity 
whose components may lack individual distinction; or 
(6) ?Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to prehistory or history. 
The certified local government or State government preservation program will review all proposed 
subdivisions that include or have a potential to include an area of historical significance. 
(I) ?"Natural prairies" (including but not limited to, roadside prairies, restored prairies and prairie 
remnants) means an area of significant size, containing a rich diversity of native flora species in 
associations typical of presettlement ecosystems, or areas with rare, threatened, endangered or 
special species. 
(J) ?"Scenic natural areas" means any area which contains a unique feature of the rural landscape 
including, but not limited to, large rock formations, hill crests, mature tree stands, and/or any 
other feature deemed to be significant by the Lexington Town Planning Commission. 
(K) ?"Stream corridors" means the primary channel of a river or stream and any portions of the 
floodplain adjoining the channel that are reasonably required to carry and discharge its water. 
(L) ?"Wetlands" means an area saturated by surface water or ground water such that it supports the 
growth and existence of vegetation suited to such areas. The key indicator for wetlands is the 
presence of hydric soils. Areas containing hydric soils will be subject to review by the USDA 
Natural Resources Conservation Service. The United States Army Corps of Engineers will make 
the final determination regarding the existence of a wetland. 
(M) ?"Woodlands" means an area containing contiguous wooded parcels of significant size, 
containing a rich diversity of native flora species in associations typical of presettlement 
ecosystems, areas with rare, threatened, endangered or special species, or with ancient

(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 9-3), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.09.04 - PROCESS. 
(A) ?The use of conservation subdivision design seeks to optimize land use in and around the Town of 
Lexington, while maintaining a balance between the preservation of agriculturally, environmentally 
and historically significant areas and allowing reasonable and sustainable growth to continue in the 
Town. New development shall avoid disturbance of areas or elements defined as "sensitive" or 
"significant." The use of conservation subdivision design may be required of all residential 
subdivisions: 
(1) ?Of twenty (20) or more lots; 
(2) ?Of fifteen (15) or more acres; 
(3) ?Located in certain identified areas of conservation (sensitive area overlay zones/districts); 
(4) ?With fifty percent (50%) or more of the parcel identified as agriculturally, environmentally or 
historically significant; and 
(5) ?Of all commercial subdivisions if an area of agricultural, environmental or historical significance 
is deemed to be located on the site proposed for development. 
(B) ?The Town encourages the use of conservation subdivision design on all suitable land in and around 
the Town. All landowners and developers are encouraged to work closely with the Town of Lexington 
planning and zoning staff in the design and platting process. 
(C) ?Density of conservation subdivisions shall be determined by dividing the total land area of the 
development by the total number of family dwelling units, which provides an average land area per 
family dwelling unit. Total land area of the development shall include all open space, including 
agricultural land, common ground, recreation areas, and land set aside for ponds and lakes, but shall 
not include the traffic surface area of subdivision roads. The density allowed is by the parcel's zoning 
unless a density bonus is awarded to the developer by the Town of Lexington Planning Commission. 
(D) ?Density bonuses may (at the discretion of the Town of Lexington Planning Commission) be 
rewarded to developers who: 
(1) ?Dedicate land for public use. Any land dedicated for public use including, but not limited to, 
trails, parks and other active recreation facilities, shall, at the discretion of the Town of 
Lexington Planning Commission, be eligible for a density bonus. 
(2) ?Build affordable housing. A density increase shall be permitted for developments/ subdivisions 
who provide affordable housing opportunities for low and moderate income families. 
(E) ?A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the parcel must be designated as permanent open space. The 
portion of the parcel designated as permanent open space shall not be further subdivided and must 
be protected by a conservation easement held by the homeowners association, local conservation 
commission, land trust or Town of Lexington that is recorded in the office of the County Registrar of 
Deeds. At least one-half (½) of the land that is to be conserved must be shaped in a manner to be 
useable for agricultural or recreational purposes. 
(F) ?The homeowners association, local conservation commission, land trust, or Town of Lexington shall 
administer the permanent open space and is responsible for the payment of any taxes, upkeep, 
insurance and any other responsibilities associated with "ownership" of the land. 
(G) ?The developer/applicant shall supply a completed application to the Town of Lexington Department 
of Building and Zoning which includes a draft of the conservation easement for the portion of the 
property that will remain as permanent open space or agricultural land and a fully dimensioned site 
plan, drawn to scale, which shall demonstrate, delineate, and label all of the following: 
(1) ?Topography, including areas to be graded, earth movements, drainage provisions, existing 
contour lines and any proposed new contour lines and any other significant topographical 
features; 
(2) ?The location and type of sensitive areas deemed to be of agricultural, environmental, or 
historical significance, as defined in § 154.09.02; 
(3) ?The location and type of all proposed areas to be preserved as open space or agricultural land, 
including areas of mitigation and preservation; 
(4) ?Existing zoning, land use(s) and approximate density of residential uses; 
(5) ?Septic or waste water provisions as provided by SCDHEC; 
(6) ?For areas of agricultural preservation, a buffer strip of at least seventy-five feet (75') must be 
delineated. When possible existing woodlands should be used; if not, a variety of rapidly 
growing indigenous trees and shrubs should be planted thickly in the buffer strip; 
(7) ?Any other provisions not specifically required or excluded herein, as required by the Town of 
Lexington land development regulations, Title XV of this Code. 
(H) ?In addition, the applicant must abide by all applicable provisions of the Town of Lexington's zoning 
ordinance, Chapter 155, not specifically excluded in this chapter. The applicant must also ensure 
that: 
(1) ?All elements of the site plan shall be readily evident upon site inspection; 
(2) ?Elements not readily evident shall be marked for identification upon site inspection; 
(3) ?Areas designated to remain as open space or agricultural land, or areas of conservation shall 
be marked for identification upon site inspection; 
(4) ?All construction contracts shall include language protecting sensitive areas, agricultural land, 
areas of conservation, and areas containing sensitive elements. 
(I) ?Upon receipt of the application, the review process for the conservation subdivisions shall be the 
same as outlined in §§ 154.03.01 through 154.03.12, procedure for plat approval. Included with the 
final plat, the subdivider shall submit a subdivider's agreement regarding the liability for and 
maintenance of the open space. In addition, the subdivider must include a conservation 
easement/open space covenant protecting the open space from any further development. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 9-4), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.09.05 - EXEMPTIONS. 
    The use of conservation subdivision design shall not be required, but is encouraged for use on 
residential subdivisions:

(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 9-7), passed 2-1-99) 


EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT 


§ 154.10.01 - PURPOSE. 
    With certain types of development, extraordinary safeguards may be necessary to protect the health, 
safety and general welfare of the citizens of the Town of Lexington. Developers are encouraged to work 
with the Planning Commission to avoid delays in project approvals. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 10-1), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.10.02 - ARTIFICIAL IMPOUNDMENTS. 
    Although aesthetically pleasing, the creation of artificial lakes or impoundments can result in 
significant water quality problems and dam safety issues. 
(A) ?Water quality. 
(1) ?Framework. Altering the natural flow of water can lead to eutrophication, a process by 
which a standing body of water becomes enriched with excess plant nutrients such as 
phosphorus and nitrogen, which results in excess algal production. This condition leads to 
lower dissolved oxygen (DO) levels which can have a detrimental effect on fish species 
and water quality. Artificial impoundments also lead to higher water temperatures and 
excess sedimentation, also harmful to aquatic species. Artificial lakes in the Town of 
Lexington should be planned carefully with a view towards ecological consequences. 
(2) ?Recommendation. Developers should take appropriate steps to maintain good water 
quality in artificial lakes. Developing a long-term strategy for maintaining water quality is 
recommended. This strategy may include the use of greater setbacks for principal 
structures and associated buildings with impermeable surfaces from the normal high water 
mark of the water body, vegetative buffers along the edge of the water body, or the 
installation of an aeration system to maintain a healthy level of DO in the water body. 
(B) ?Dams. 
(1) ?Framework. A dam breach can be a significant threat to the safety of homeowners, and 
motorists (in the event that a road is constructed on a dam). For this reason all dams must 
meet either requirements of the South Carolina Department of Dam Safety, the U.S. Corps 
of Engineers or § 154.10.02(B)(2), whichever is applicable. 
(2) ?Requirements. Any dam construction not covered under the requirements of the South 
Carolina Department of Dam Safety and for the purpose of creating an artificial 
impoundment for the benefit of a residential subdivision, including subdivisions not yet 
proposed, shall conform with the following requirements: 
(a) ?The developer must provide dam construction drawings and plans certified by a 
professional engineer to the Planning Commission prior to beginning any site work. 
(b) ?Upon concurrence by the Planning Commission and the Town Engineer that the 
proposed dam construction will not cause unreasonable harm to the health, safety 
and general welfare of the residents of the Town, the developer may proceed with 
construction. 
(c) ?Dam construction shall be periodically inspected by the developer's engineer to 
ensure conformance with the approved drawings and plans. The developer shall be 
responsible for notifying the Planning Commission and the Town Engineer during a 
minimum of three (3) phases of dam construction (see below). The Town Engineer 
may inspect the construction at their discretion. 
(i) ?Phase 1: Coring, backfilling and setting of invert; 
(ii) ?Phase 2: Mid-construction of fill; 
(iii) ?Phase 3: Top fill and grading. 
(d) ?Dams existing prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter must 
meet the requirements of this chapter before a road is constructed on the dam. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 10-2), passed 2-1-99) 


LAND SURVEYING STANDARDS: CONNECTING SURVEYS TO STATE PLANE COORDINATE SYSTEM 


§ 154.11.01 - PURPOSE. 
(A) ?The purpose of §§ 154.11.01 through 154.11.06 is to require certain land parcels, located within 
reasonable distance from monumented control points, to be referenced by field survey to geodetic 
control points which are defined by State plane coordinates. In cases where monumented control 
points are not within a reasonable distance as defined in this chapter, the requirement will be to 
reference the survey to points which are identifiable on the County orthophoto maps. Property 
surveys affected by §§ 154.11.01 through 154.11.06 will be referenced to accurate geographical 
locations, and therefore can be plotted in their correct position on the state plane coordinate based 
County mapping system. These positions can be reproduced to the same accuracy as the original 
determination, even if all physically platted corners or supporting evidence, or both, has been 
destroyed. 
(B) ?This will improve greatly County land records by allowing ground surveys to be easily and 
accurately translated to County maps, hard-copy or electronic. In addition, land owners will benefit in 
that property corners tied directly to monumented geodetic control by field surveys are defined by 
mathematical references which cannot be destroyed; therefore, in the future, missing or destroyed 
property corners can be more easily reestablished with a high level of confidence. 
(C) ?This concept has existed for many years, but it has not been practical to apply on the County level 
until recent developments in technology allowed the cost-effective production of accurate mapping 
systems and the placement of closely-spaced geodetic control monuments defined by very accurate 
coordinates. In addition the recent development of the satellite based Global Positioning System 
(GPS) is revolutionizing control surveys. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (Art. 11 (part)), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.11.02 - SURVEYS REQUIRING TIE TO GEODETIC CONTROL MONUMENT. 
    The following surveys require ties to geodetic control monuments: 
(A) ?Any subdivision of five (5) or more lots within a one mile traverse distance of geodetic control; 
(B) ?Any tract of five (5) or more acres within a one mile traverse distance of geodetic control; 
(C) ?Any subdivision of twenty-five (25) or more lots or nonagricultural industrial/ commercial 
development of twenty-five (25) or more acres regardless of distance from geodetic control.

§ 154.11.03 - SURVEYS EXEMPT FROM GEODETIC CONTROL MONUMENT TIE. 
(A) ?It is considered very desirable for surveyors to tie all surveys, whenever possible, to the State plane 
coordinate system. Nothing in these exemptions is intended to discourage surveyors from tying 
surveys to the State plane coordinate system. 
(B) ?The following surveys are exempted from geodetic control monument tie: 
(1) ?Mortgage surveys of residential property in existing subdivisions; 
(2) ?Any survey not specified in § 154.11.02. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (Art. 11 (part)), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.11.04 - SURVEYS REQUIRING ORTHOPHOTO LOCATOR TIE. 
(A) ?With the exception of mortgage surveys, all surveys not tied to geodetic control shall have a "locator 
tie." A locator tie is defined as a bearing and distance tie from a property corner to a point identifiable 
on the orthophoto map such as a building corner, a road intersection with a driveway or other point 
that can be accurately spotted on the orthophoto. 
(B) ?To support this requirement, the County will make copies of the County orthophoto maps available 
to licensed surveyors at a reasonable cost. Special pricing to surveyors will be contingent upon these 
maps being for the surveyors use only. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (Art. 11 (part)), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.11.05 - SURVEY REQUIREMENTS. 
    Survey requirements specified in this chapter are only for control survey connections between 
geodetic survey monuments and land parcels. Boundary surveys shall be performed in accordance with 
the State Minimum Standards published by the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers 
and Land Surveyors unless requirements that are more stringent are specified herein. In so far as 
possible, control surveys between geodetic monuments and property boundaries shall be extended from 
the nearest geodetic control monument(s). County specifications for horizontal control are as follows: 
(A) ?Terrestrial surveys. 
(1) ?If control is extended no more than one-half (½) mile from control monument to property 
boundary third-order, class I (1/10,000) specifications shall be followed. 
(2) ?If control is extended more that one-half (½) mile from the control monument to the 
property boundary second-order, class II specifications shall be followed. 
(B) ?Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys. If GPS is used, procedures shall be followed to 
insure compatibility with the nearest geodetic control monuments to an accuracy of at least 5 
cm + 2 ppm. Only survey grade GPS receivers shall be used for boundary control. 
(C) ?Plat requirements. 
(1) ?State plane coordinates shall be shown on the plat for at least two (2) property corners. 
The geodetic monument(s) used for control will be noted on the plat with the grid distance 
and azimuth shown to at least one of the coordinated property corners. 
(2) ?Horizontal ground distances (not grid distance) will be shown on the plat for all segments 
of the boundary survey. A combined State plane coordinate sea level reduction factor will 
be noted on the plat. Area will be based on horizontal ground distances. 
(3) ?All bearings will be referenced to State plane coordinate grid north. 
(4) ?Survey caps identifying the surveyor shall be placed on all new corners set on surveys 
covered by this chapter. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (Art. 11 (part)), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.11.06 - ELECTRONIC DATA FILES. 
    If the parcel or subdivision is generated with computer-aided drafting procedures, the Town may 
request a copy of the electronic file to be copied on Town-supplied medium. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (Art. 11 (part)), passed 2-1-99) 


INTENT, AUTHORITY TO MODIFY AND MAINTENANCE 


§ 154.12.01 - INTENT. 
    These regulations do not intend to freeze new developments into any single type of design, but to 
insure that all new developments shall contribute to the building of economically sound and desirable 
living areas within the community with all necessary services and facilities. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 12-1), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.12.02 - AUTHORITY TO MODIFY STANDARDS. 
    In order to provide the subdivider with maximum flexibility in the design and character of new 
residential developments, the Planning Commission is authorized to modify the standards and 
requirements of these regulations in the case of a plan for an experimental subdivision or planned 
development, which in the judgment of the Planning Commission provides adequate public spaces for the 
circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, and 
which also provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity to and 
achievement of the plan. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 12-2), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.12.03 - MAINTENANCE OF SPIRIT OF REGULATIONS. 
    Any development or subdivision approved under this chapter shall maintain the objectives, purposes 
and intent of these regulations and the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. 99-004, § 2 (§ 12-3), passed 2-1-99) 


§ 154.12.04 - APPEALS PROCESS. 
(A) ?Appeals of the decision of the Administrative Official. If an applicant disagrees with the disapproval 
or approval with modification of the sketch plan by the Administrative Official, he may submit the 
sketch plan to the Planning Commission at its next regular meeting. The Planning Commission shall 
review the sketch plan at the meeting at which it is presented, and act on the appeal with pertinent 
comments and decisions noted in the minutes of the Planning Commission meeting.

within two (2) years of the issuance of the permit. However, the landowner of real property with such 
vested right may apply at the end of the vesting period to Town Council for at least five (5) annual 
extensions of the vested right unless an amendment to the land development ordinances or

ARTICLE II. - APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS 


DIVISION 1. - SPECIFIC USE AND AREA REQUIREMENTS 


§ 155.03.01 - CLASSIFICATION OF USES. 
    The provisions of this division shall be known as the "Schedule of Permitted Uses." The purpose of 
these provisions is to classify uses into a number of specially defined types on the basis of common 
functional characteristics and similar compatibility with other uses, thereby providing a basis for the 
regulation of uses in accordance with criteria which are directly relevant to the public interest. These 
provisions shall apply throughout the Ordinance. In the event of conflicting interpretations, or uncertain 
references to a particular use, the Zoning Administrator shall assign uses to the most appropriate activity 
category. Any person aggrieved by an interpretation may appeal such to the Board of Zoning Appeals for 
review. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.03.02 - DESCRIPTION OF PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES. 
    All activities are hereby classified into the activity types listed in § 155.03.09. Vacant land, itself, shall 
not constitute an activity type. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.03.03 - CORRECT ZONING DISTRICT AND ROAD CLASSIFICATION REQUIRED. 
    In order for an activity to be allowed on a particular parcel, both the zoning district of the parcel and 
the road classification of the road(s) from which the parcel obtains access must allow the use. See the 
charts in § 155.03.09 for the zoning districts in which and the road classifications on which each use is 
allowed. 
(A) ?Zoning districts. In order to implement the provisions of this Ordinance, the following zoning 
districts are hereby established: 
(1) ?Regular districts. 
(a) ?Protected. 
1. ?Protected Residential (PR): In order to benefit the public health, safety, and

not part of a cluster development (a development in which homes are tightly 
clustered together) from incompatible and disruptive activities. 
2. ?Protected Residential Two (PR2): In order to benefit the public health, safety, and 
general welfare, this district is designed to protect single-family homes that are

communities and duplexes from incompatible and disruptive activities. 
3. ?High-Density Residential (HDR): In order to benefit the public health, safety, and 
general welfare, this district is designed to protect the residents of apartments 
and high-density townhouses and condominiums from incompatible and 
disruptive activities. 
Notes: 
• ?The location of homes for the mentally and/or physically handicapped shall be 
governed by S.C. Code § 6-29-770. However, the location of other types of group 
homes, such as but not limited to hospice facilities and halfway houses, shall 
follow the requirements of this Ordinance regarding those activities. 
• ?All church-related activities shall be allowed in all zoning districts per S.C. Code § 
6-7-15.

1. ?Office Commercial (OC): This district is designed to allow medical and office uses 
in locations where such uses benefit the public health, safety, and general 
welfare. 
2. ?Neighborhood Commercial (NC): This district is designed to allow nonintensive

(2) ?Special overlay districts. 
(a) ?Planned Development (PD) Special Overlay District: By providing for variations from 
the Town's land use ordinances concerning use, setbacks, lot size, density, bulk, and 
other requirements, Planned Developments accommodate flexibility in the 
arrangement of uses that result in improved design, character, and quality for the 
general purpose of promoting and protecting the public health, safety, and general 
welfare. 
(b) ?Drainage and Floodplain (FP) Special Overlay District: The purpose of this district is 
to protect the lives and property of people who live near floodplain areas and to 
preserve the natural drainageways for the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(c) ?Downtown (DT) Special Overlay District: The purpose of this district is to establish 
special requirements for the designed downtown area that recognize its special nature 
and that encourage development therein that benefits the public health, safety, and 
general welfare. 
(d) ?Industrial Special Overlay Districts: The purpose of these districts is to accommodate 
industrial uses in locations where such uses benefit the public health, safety, and 
general welfare. These are the districts referred to in the landscaping and tree 
ordinance as the Industrial District. 
1. ?Railroad Industrial Special Overlay District: The purpose of this district is to 
accommodate industrial uses along the railroad corridor, where such uses benefit 
the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2. ?Reserved for future industrial districts. 
(e) ?Commercial Corridors (CC) Special Overlay District: The purpose of this district is to 
allow for enforcement of the Architectural and Appearance Standards Ordinance. The 
district includes all parcels that are in the Town of Lexington at the time of the 
enactment of this Ordinance that have any portion of the lot fronting on or accessing 
any of the following roads:

also shall become part of the Commercial Corridors Special Overlay District. 
(f) ?Preservation Corridor (PC) Special Overlay District: The purpose of this district is to 
preserve right-of-way in areas that either are or may be impacted by growth. Within 
this corridor, the buffer shall be twenty feet (20'), and the building setback shall be 
thirty feet (30'); but where the use of the property dictates larger buffers and setbacks

Moreover, as parcels on these roads that have any portion of the lot fronting on or 
accessing any of the above-named roads that are not in the Town of Lexington at the 
time of enactment of this Ordinance are annexed into the Town of Lexington, they 
also shall become part of the Commercial Corridors Special Overlay District. 
Several Town ordinances, specifically but not limited to Title XV—Land Usage, Chapter 159—
Sign Ordinance, and Chapter 156—Landscaping and Tree Ordinance, refer to outdated zoning 
districts. The Approving Authority shall have the discretion to determine how the outdated 
zoning districts correspond with the current zoning districts, using the following as a guideline: 
• ?IDD (Intense Development District) generally shall mean IND (Industrial), GC (General 
Commercial) or HDR (High-Density Residential), but may also mean OC (Office 
Commercial), NC (Neighborhood Commercial), or LC (Limited Commercial). 
• ?RDD (Restricted Development District) generally shall mean OC (Office Commercial), NC 
(Neighborhood Commercial), or LC (Limited Commercial), but also may mean IND 
(Industrial), GC (General Commercial), HDR (High-Density Residential), PR (Protected 
Residential) or PR2 (Protected Residential 2). 
• ?PRD (Protected Residential District) shall mean PR (Protected Residential). 
• ?PRD2 (Protected Residential District 2) shall mean PR2 (Protected Residential 2). 
The determination how an outdated district corresponds to a current district shall not be 
arbitrary but shall be based on an assessment of the intent of the outdated zoning district 
compared to the intent of the current zoning district in the particular circumstance. 
(B) ?Street classifications. In order to implement the provisions of this Ordinance, the following 
street classifications are hereby established: 
(1) ?Arterial (A): A freeway, expressway, street or highway that is used or intended to be used 
for moving either heavy vehicular traffic volumes or high-speed traffic, or both. 
(2) ?Collector (C): A street that is used or intended to be used for moving traffic from minor 
streets to major thoroughfares, including the principal entrance and sometimes the 
circulation street or streets of a development. 
(3) ?Local (L): A street that is used or intended to be used to provide access to other streets 
from individual properties. The following subcategories of Local streets are established to 
handle the special circumstances described: 
(a) ?Residential Local Six (RL6): A street within a residential development that generally 
is intended to accommodate residential activities at six (6) dwelling units per gross 
acre. Access shall generally be limited to residential development and allowed home 
occupations or accessory activities. 
(b) ?Residential Local Four (RL4): A street within a residential development that generally 
is intended to accommodate residential activities at four (4) dwelling units per gross 
acre. Access shall generally be limited to residential development and allowed home 
occupations or accessory activities. 
(c) ?Residential Local Two (RL2): This type of street generally is intended to 
accommodate residential activities at two (2) dwelling units per gross acre. Access 
shall generally be limited to residential development and allowed home occupations or 
accessory activities. 
(d) ?Limited Local (LL): A street that contains a location or design flaw that limits traffic 
movements or volumes. The conditions of the problem should be unlikely to be 
improved. Access to this type of street will be limited. These may also include alleys, a 
public or private right-of-way primarily designed to serve as secondary access to the 
side or rear of those properties whose principal frontage is on some other street. 
Whenever new streets or portions of streets are added within the Town by virtue of annexation, 
such new streets shall be classified by Ordinance of the Town Council in the manner set forth in 
§ 155.20.09 of this Ordinance. Whenever new streets or portions of streets are added within the 
Town by virtue of new construction, such new streets shall be classified by the Administrative 
Official in the manner set forth in § 155.20.09 of this Ordinance. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07; Ord. 2007-40, § 1, passed 12-3-07; Ord. 2008-06, § 1, 
passed 1-7-08; Ord. 2008-38, § 1, passed 6-2-08; Ord. 2017-38 , § 1, 7-10-17) 


§ 155.03.04 - THE EFFECT OF OTHER ZONING RESTRICTIONS. 
    In order for an activity to be allowed on a particular parcel, it must meet all of the requirements within 
the Town of Lexington's ordinances that pertain to that use unless the Board of Zoning Appeals grants a 
variance that lessens one or more of these requirements with respect to the activity. 
    Moreover, if the activity is located within a special overlay district, the activity must meet the 
regulations pertaining to the special overlay district unless the Board of Zoning Appeals grants a variance 
that lessens one or more of these requirements with respect to the activity. See Article IV of this 
Ordinance for overlay district regulations. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.03.05 - HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS. 
    Height regulations are based upon the establishment of a height control plane that cannot be 
penetrated. They differ depending on whether the particular parcel must follow the "intensive" rules or the 
"restrictive" rules; see § 155.03.09 to determine whether a particular parcel must follow the "intensive" or 
"restrictive" rules. 
    At the property line for parcels to which the "intensive" rules apply, a 30-foot initial rise is permitted; 
at the property line for parcels to which the "restrictive" rules apply, a 15-foot initial rise is permitted. Then, 
based upon the district and specific activity involved, the height control plane is formed in terms of a ratio 
of vertical rise to horizontal distance. 
    The following diagrams illustrate the nature of the height control plane. Regarding the second 
diagram, see the chart in § 155.03.09 for the specific ratios of the principal activities. 
 
    The formula for determining the allowed height for parcels to which the "restrictive" rules apply is: 
Allowed height = (distance from property line × height ratio) + 15 feet

(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.03.06 - REQUIRED BUFFERS. 
    A buffer is an area of land in which no activity is permitted other than a passive activity. Parking is 
not considered a passive activity and thus is not permitted in the buffer area, but driveways may cross the 
buffer to provide access to the activity conducted on the parcel. 
    Buffer areas vary depending upon the zoning district of the parcel, the nature of the activity 
proposed, and the nature of the activities of adjacent parcels. 
    Buffers are measured from the property line inward; however, buffers may be measured from across 
roads, railroads, and utility rights-of-way as well as from across bodies of water where those exist 
adjacent to the property line from which the buffer is being measured. See § 155.03.07 for illustration of 
how to apply buffers (and setbacks); assume that all parcels shown are located in the Town of Lexington. 
    If a property is split-zoned, distances will only apply to the adjacent property sides and not to the 
district zone line through the property unless the intended activity is not allowed in one of the split-zoned 
districts. See § 155.03.07 for illustration of how to apply setbacks and buffers on split-zoned property. 
    The charts in § 155.03.09 list the required buffers for each activity. 
    In addition to the required buffers listed for each activity in § 155.03.09, a 100-foot buffer shall be 
measured from all residential or otherwise protected property lines that are adjacent to a golf course. This 
buffer would automatically come into effect at such time as the golf course or any portion of it ceases to 
exist and any other activity begins on the property formerly occupied by the golf course. In the buffer 
area, any other activities more intense than passive recreation are prohibited. Driveways may cross into 
the buffer area but not roads. The additional buffer shall not apply to "regulated areas," including but not 
limited to Utility Easements, Flood Plains and wetlands. It shall apply and be measured as to areas 
abutting a tee box, fairway or green of the subject golf course. 
    For the purpose of this section, "protected" refers to protected zoning districts as described in § 
155.03.03 as well as the note to that section that classifies as protected all Town-owned property 
regardless of the zoning district of the particular Town-owned property. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07; Ord. 2008-42, § 1, passed 8-4-08) 


§ 155.03.07 - REQUIRED SETBACKS. 
    A setback is an area of land in which passive activities are allowed, as well as accessory activities 
such as parking unless superseded by a required buffer or otherwise governed by § 155.05.05. Buildings 
or other structures comprising the principal activity shall not encroach upon the setback area. 
    Setback areas vary depending upon the zoning district of the parcel, the nature of the activity 
proposed, and the nature of the activities of adjacent parcels. 
    Where the parcel in question meets the right-of-way of a road, railroad, or utility, or a body of water, 
the setback area is measured from the point that the property line meets the right-of-way or body of water 
inward. In other words, setbacks shall not be measured from across roads, railroads, and utility rights-of-
way or bodies of water where those exist adjacent to the property line in question. Where the parcel in 
question meets a property line of an adjacent parcel that is not a road, railroad, utility, or body of water, 
the setback area is measured from the property line inward. See below for illustration of how to apply 
setbacks (and buffers); assume that all parcels shown are located in the Town of Lexington. 
    If a property is split-zoned, distances will only apply to the adjacent property sides and not to the 
district zone line through the property unless the intended activity is not allowed in one of the split-zoned 
districts, as shown by the illustration below. 
    The charts in § 155.03.09 list the required setbacks for each activity. 
 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.03.08 - REQUIRED PARKING. 
    The charts in § 155.03.09 list the required number of parking spaces for each activity. When an 
activity on a parcel is comprised of two (2) or more separate uses, the parking ratios for each separate 
activity shall be calculated and applied in the aggregate for the entire parcel. 
    An automotive parking space is defined to consist of a space no less than: 
• ?Nine feet (9') by eighteen feet (18') for standard size vehicles; 
• ?Seven feet (7') by fifteen feet (15') for compact vehicles; 
• ?Nine feet (9') by eighteen feet (18') for handicapped cars; and 
• ?Twelve feet (12') by eighteen feet (18') for handicapped vans 
    Unless the percentage is further restricted for a particular activity by the charts in § 155.03.09, no 
more than ten percent (10%) of the parking requirements of this Ordinance may be satisfied by the 
designation of compact spaces. 
    The allocation of handicapped spaces shall be in accord with applicable State and Federal laws for 
such as well as the building codes adopted by the Town of Lexington. 
    When determining parking area requirements, portions of the public right-of-way including the street 
cannot be considered as permissible for maneuvering incidental to parking. 
    Exceptions: 
(a) ?Where use is a residential activity on road that is classified as Local or as one of the Local 
subcategories. 
(b) ?Where activity is in the Downtown Special Overlay District on road that is classified as Local or 
one of the Local subcategories. 
    Parking areas shall be clearly defined. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07; Ord. 2019-14 , § 1, passed 3-4-19) 


§ 155.03.09 - CHART OF HEIGHT, SETBACK, BUFFER, AND PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH ACTIVITY. 
(A) ?Rules of interpretation. 
(1) ?Regarding the charts in § 155.03.09: 
• ?The first column lists and defines the activities allowed in the Town of Lexington. 
• ?The second column lists the districts in which a particular use is permitted. 
• ?The third column lists the road classifications that are required to support a particular use. 
• ?The fourth column lists the category used to apply the height ratio, setbacks, and buffers 
("restrictive" or "intensive"—see next paragraph). 
• ?The fifth column lists the required buffers for each activity. 
• ?The sixth column lists the required setbacks for each activity against the adjacent property 
line, where applicable, and against the right-of-way, where applicable. 
• ?The seventh column lists the measure used to determine the required parking spaces for 
each activity. 
• ?The last column lists some of the special regulations that pertain to the activity. 
(2) ?Rules of interpretation for § 155.03.09(B) (Commercial and industrial uses): To determine 
whether to apply the "restrictive" or "intensive" height ratio, setbacks, and buffers, apply the 
following rules: 
(a) ?Where a parcel with an "unprotected" zoning designation abuts another parcel with an 
"unprotected" zoning designation or an In-Town Residential Multiple activity, apply the 
"intensive" requirements on that portion of the parcel(s) so abutting. 
(b) ?Where a parcel with an "unprotected" zoning designation abuts either (a) a parcel with a 
"protected" zoning designation except for In-Town Residential Multiple or (b) an In-Town 
parcel that is used for residential single or duplex activity (including the common area of 
residential developments) regardless of the associated zoning district, apply the 
"restrictive" requirements on that portion of the parcel(s) so abutting. 
(c) ?Where a parcel with an "unprotected" zoning designation abuts an Out-of-Town parcel(s) 
that has any residential use (including the common area of residential developments), 
except Residential Multiple, wherein the residence is located less than fifty feet (50') from 
the adjoining property line, unless the owner of the parcel has given written permission to 
the Town to apply a lesser requirement or the owner of the parcel does not allow the Town 
to enter onto the property for measuring purposes, apply the "restrictive" requirements on 
that portion of the parcel(s) so abutting; however, in no case may the lesser requirement 
exceed the Town's "intensive" requirements. 
(d) ?Where a parcel with an "unprotected" zoning designation abuts an Out-of-Town parcel(s) 
that is vacant or is being used for any commercial, industrial or Residential Multiple use, or 
has a residence located more than fifty feet (50') from the adjoining property line, apply the 
"intensive" requirements on that portion of the parcel(s) so abutting. 
On parcels that are zoned Industrial (IND), whether or not those parcels are located in an 
Industrial Special Overlay District, the Approving Authority has the discretion to allow not only 
the uses that are expressly listed in the chart in § 155.03.09(B) as being allowed on parcels that 
are zoned IND but also any commercial activity that is permitted by the chart in § 155.03.09(B). 
The decision whether to allow a particular commercial activity on a parcel that is zoned IND 
shall be based on criteria that include but are not limited to: 
• ?Whether the location is reasonable for such a use; 
• ?Whether the intent of the zoning district supports such a use; 
• ?Whether the intent of the road classification supports such a use; 
• ?Whether the proposed use is compatible with existing adjacent and nearby uses; 
• ?Whether the proposed use is likely to be compatible with future industrial uses on adjacent 
and nearby parcels; 
• ?Whether setbacks and buffers between the proposed use and existing adjacent uses are 
reasonable; 
• ?Whether the height ratio is reasonable in relation to the heights of adjacent and nearby 
uses; and 
• ?Whether the activity is in the best interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
Regarding industrial uses that the chart in § 155.03.09 permits to take place on parcels that are 
zoned IND, the Approving Authority also has the discretion to allow those uses access to roads 
that are classified as Local, Collector, or Arterial, regardless of whether those road 
classifications are listed as being ones on which the particular industrial use is permitted by the 
chart in § 155.03.09. The decision whether to allow a particular industrial activity access to a 
Local, Collector, or Arterial road when the particular activity does not expressly list the road 
classification in question as one from which it can gain access in the chart in § 155.03.09 shall 
be based on criteria including but not limited to: 
• ?Whether the road in question from which the use would gain access can physically support 
the proposed use; 
• ?Whether the use would create a physical burden on the road in question beyond that for 
which the road is intended by the entity that maintains the road; 
• ?Whether the traffic caused by the proposed use would create congestion beyond that which 
the road is intended or is able to handle; 
• ?Whether the access would create a safety hazard; 
• ?Whether the access is in the best interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare; 
and 
• ?Whether the intent of the road classification supports such a use. 
(3) ?Rule of interpretation for § 155.03.09(C) (Residential uses): On parcels with a "protected" 
zoning designation, apply the listed requirements regardless of the activity of the adjacent 
parcels. 
(4) ?Rule of interpretation for § 155.03.09(D) (Mixed uses): Where a project mixes both residential 
and commercial activities, the Approving Authority will apply the rules of interpretation that 
govern the commercial activity(ies) in § 155.03.09(B) as if the residential activity(ies) did not 
exist. 
(5) ?Rule of interpretation for § 155.03.09(E) (Office parks, commercial centers, and multitenant 
commercial buildings): 
(a) ?Where an activity is listed in § 155.03.09(E) as "allowed by right" in an office park, 
commercial center, or multitenant commercial building, the requirements associated with 
that activity as listed in § 155.03.09(B) do not apply. Instead, the requirements listed in § 
155.03.09(E) apply; however, the rules of interpretation are the same as for § 
155.03.09(B). 
(b) ?An exception to this general rule is that activities that are "allowed by right" may go into 
office parks, commercial centers, and multitenant commercial buildings that were built prior 
to the enactment of this Ordinance without regard to whether the office parks, commercial 
centers, and multitenant commercial buildings can meet the requirements listed in § 
155.03.09(E) regarding setbacks, buffers, and parking or obtain a variance from those 
requirements. 
(c) ?Where an activity is not listed in § 155.03.09(E) as "allowed by right" in an office park, 
commercial center, or multitenant commercial building, the activity still may be allowed in 
an office park, commercial center, or multitenant commercial building if it can meet the 
requirements associated with the activity as listed in § 155.03.09(B) and as governed by 
the rules of interpretation for § 155.03.09(B). However, one deviation from the application 
of the rules of interpretation listed for § 155.03.09(B) exists: for office parks, commercial 
centers, and multitenant commercial buildings, setbacks and buffers are applied to the 
external property lines but not to the internal property lines where internal property lines 
exist (distances between multiple buildings that are located on one parcel are dictated by 
Town of Lexington Building Code requirements). 
(d) ?Where an activity is not listed in § 155.03.09(E) as "allowed by right" in an office park, 
commercial center, or multitenant commercial building, and where the activity cannot meet 
the regular requirements associated with that activity as listed in § 155.03.09(B), the 
person who is proposing the activity may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a 
variance to allow them to operate within the office park, commercial center, or multitenant 
commercial building. 
(e) ?Where setbacks and buffers apply to office parks, commercial centers, and multitenant 
commercial buildings, the setbacks and buffers are measured from the location of the 
activity, which is not necessarily the edge of the building. See below illustration. 

 
(6) ?Rule of interpretation for Special Overlay Districts: Where a parcel is located in a Special 
Overlay District, the rules associated with that district override the above rules where there is a 
conflict between the rules. See Article IV. 
(B) ?Commercial and industrial uses.

(D) ?Mixed uses. Where a project mixes both residential and commercial uses, the Approving Authority 
will review the project based on its ability to meet the following criteria: 
• ?Whether the location is reasonable for such a project. 
• ?Whether the intent of the zoning district supports such a project. 
• ?Whether the intent of the road classification supports such a project. 
• ?Whether the proposed uses are compatible. 
• ?Whether setbacks and buffers between mixed-use project and adjacent parcels are reasonable. 
• ?Whether the amount of proposed parking is reasonable to support the intended uses. 
• ?Whether the height ratio is reasonable in relation to the heights of adjacent and nearby parcels. 
• ?Whether the project encourages pedestrian access to businesses. 
• ?Whether the businesses will be able to restrict deliveries to the hours of seven (7:00) a.m. to 
seven (7:00) p.m. 
    The Approving Authority has the authority to reject proposals for mixed-use projects based on the 
inability of the project to meet these criteria in such a way that would negatively affect the public health, 
safety, or welfare. 
    Home occupations are not considered a mixed use. 
(E) ?Office parks, commercial centers, and multitenant commercial building.

The applicant for a conditional use zoning permit for construction of a communications tower or 
placement of a commercial telecommunication antenna on an existing structure other than a 
tower previously permitted must file with the Approving Authority an application accompanied by 
a fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) and the following documents, if applicable: 
(1) ?One copy of typical specifications for proposed structures and antennae, including 
description of design characteristics and material; 
(2) ?A site plan drawn to scale showing property boundaries, tower location, tower height, guy 
wires and anchors, existing structures, photographs or elevation drawings depicting typical 
design of proposed structures, parking, fences, landscape plan, and existing land uses on 
adjacent property; [site plan not required if antenna is to be mounted on an approved 
existing structure]; 
(3) ?A current map, or update for an existing map on file, showing locations of applicant's 
antennae, facilities, existing towers, and proposed towers which are reflected in public 
records, serving any property within the Town; 
(4) ?A report from a structural engineer registered in South Carolina showing the tower 
antenna capacity by type and number, and a certification that the tower is designed to 
withstand winds in accordance with ANSI/EIA/TIA 222 (latest revision) standards; 
(5) ?Identification of the owners of all antennae and equipment to be located on the site; 
(6) ?Written authorization from the site owner for the application; 
(7) ?Evidence with a valid FCC license for the proposed activity has been issued; 
(8) ?A line-of-sight analysis showing the potential visual and aesthetic impacts on adjacent 
residential districts; 
(9) ?A written agreement to remove the tower and/or antenna within one hundred eighty (180) 
days after cessation of use; 
(10) ?Evidence that applicable conditions in subsection (D) are met; and 
(11) ?Additional information required by the Approving Authority for determination that all 
applicable zoning regulations are met. 
[(C) ?Reserved.] 
(D) ?Conditions. Applicant must show that all applicable conditions are met. 
(1) ?The proposed communications tower, antenna or accessory structure will be placed in a 
reasonably available location which will minimize the visual impact on the surrounding area 
and allow the facility to function in accordance with minimum standards imposed by 
applicable communications regulations and applicant's technical design requirements. 
(2) ?Applicant must show that a proposed antenna and equipment cannot be accommodated 
and function as required by applicable regulations and applicant's technical design 
requirements without unreasonable modifications on any existing structure or tower under 
the control of applicant. 
(3) ?Applicant for a permit in a residential district must show that the area cannot be 
adequately served by a facility placed in a nonresidential district for valid technical reasons. 
(4) ?Prior to consideration of a permit for location on private property which must be acquired, 
applicant must show that available publicly owned sites, and available privately owned 
sites occupied by a compatible use, or unsuitable for operation of the facility under 
applicable communications regulations and applicant's technical design requirements. 
(5) ?Applicant must show that a new tower is designed to accommodate additional antennae 
equal in number to applicant's present and future requirements. 
(6) ?Applicant must show that all applicable health, nuisance, noise, fire, building and safety 
code requirements are met. 
(7) ?A communications tower must not be painted or illuminated unless otherwise provided by 
state or federal regulations. 
(8) ?A permit for a proposed tower site within one thousand feet (1,000') of an existing tower 
shall not be issued unless the applicant certifies that the existing tower does not meet 
applicant's structural specifications and applicant's technical design requirements, or that a 
collocation agreement could not be obtained. 
(9) ?Must show by certificate from a registered engineer that the proposed facility will contain 
only equipment meeting FCC rules, and must file with the Approving Authority a written 
indemnification of the municipality and proof of liability insurance or financial ability to 
respond to claims up to one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) in the aggregate which may 
arise from operation of the facility during its life, at no cost to the municipality, in form 
approved by the municipal attorney. 
(10) ?Land development regulations, visibility, fencing, screening, landscaping, parking, 
access, lot size, exterior illumination, sign, storage, and all other general zoning district 
regulations except setback and height, shall apply to the use. Setback and height 
conditions in this section apply. 
(11) ?A tower must be a minimum distance equal to one-half (½) the height of the tower from 
property designated historic or architecturally significant, and must be set back from all lot 
lines distances based on a height ratio of 4:1 or twenty-five percent (25%) of the tower 
height, whichever is greater. (Example: For historical property using a tower height of one 
hundred feet (100'), the setbacks would be as follows: ½ of tower height = 50'; based on 
height ratio = 45'; based on the 25% rule = 25'. The greater figure of fifty feet (50') will be 
used. The fifty feet (50') will be from the tower footprint, which includes guy wires.) 
Prior to issuing a permit, the Approving Authority shall make use of technical services of the 
Municipal Association of South Carolina to determine that the standards in subsection (D)(2), 
(3), (4), (5), (7), and (9) of this section are met. 
[(E) ?Reserved.] 
(F) ?Special exceptions. A tower, pole or antenna may be permitted by special exception granted by 
the Board of Zoning Appeals after public hearing and findings of fact based on the following 
criteria: 
(1) ?All application requirements and conditions imposed by subsection (D) of this section for 
conditions uses are met except height limitations and setbacks. 
(2) ?If additional tower height is requested, total tower height will not exceed one hundred fifty 
percent (150%) of the maximum height permitted in the district as a conditional use. 
(3) ?Applicant has demonstrated that additional height above that permitted by conditional use 
regulations is necessary for service to occupants of an area within the municipality. 
(4) ?Setback requirements and such additional conditions are established by the Board as it 
deems necessary to remove danger to health and safety, and to protect adjacent property. 
(5) ?Prior to approving a permit by special exception or on appeal from action of the Approving 
Authority on an application for a conditional use, the Board shall make use of technical 
services of the Municipal Association of South Carolina to determine that the standards in 
subsection (D)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (8), and (9) of this section are met. 
(6) ?The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires that a denial of a permit be supported by 
substantial evidence. 
(7) ?The Board may not grant a variance from the standards imposed for a communications 
tower or antenna in connection with granting a special exception, except as permitted.

DIVISION 3. - SPECIFIC AREA AND USE REQUIREMENTS PERTAINING TO RESIDENTIAL ACTIVITIES 


§ 155.05.01 - DENSITY OF RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. 
    The allowable density of residential development shall be based upon the classification of the road or 
street that provides access to a particular piece of property and not on the street classifications of the 
internal roads of the development. The following chart gives the maximum residential density for each 
external access street by classification in dwelling units per net area. 
    In the event an activity is proposed that derives access from two (2) or more streets with differing 
classifications, and thus different densities, then, if the project is to be fully interconnected, the road with 
the lowest permitted density will govern the density for the entire project. If, however, on a given parcel, 
the project is not internally connected, then those portions of the property deriving access from a road 
with a stated density will be governed by that particular maximum unit density. 
    Exception: Should the Approving Authority require more than one access road for safety purposes, 
the density will be determined solely from the main access road.

DIVISION 4. - OTHER REQUIREMENTS PERTAINING TO USE AND AREA 


§ 155.06.01 - DRIVEWAY REQUIREMENTS. 
(A) ?Sight distance. Driveways shall be located so as to provide for a sight distance of one hundred feet 
(100') for each ten (10) miles per hour of speed limit assigned to the particular road accessed. Sight 
distance shall be measured from a seeing height of four feet (4') to an object three feet (3') in height. 
For exceptions pertaining to residential property, see § 155.05.03. 
(B) ?Corner and vision clearances (sight triangles). At the intersection of two (2) streets, a triangle 
formed by the streets' rights-of-way and a straight line connecting them at points twenty-five feet 
(25') from the right-of-way intersection must be kept clear of all vegetation, driveways, walls or 
structures including commercial or residential signs, save for required utility appurtenances and 
required highway locational or regulatory signs, between a height of two and one-half feet (2.5') and 
ten feet (10') to provide for safer movement of motorists and pedestrians. 
    At the intersection of a street and a driveway, a triangle formed by the street's right-of-way, the 
driveway's edge, and a straight line connecting them at points fifteen feet (15') from the intersection of the 
right-of-way and the edge of the driveway shall be clear of vegetation, walls or structures including 
commercial or residential signs, save for required utility appurtenances and required highway locational or 
regulatory signs, between two and one-half feet (2.5') and ten feet (10') to provide for safer movement of 
motorists and pedestrians. 
    The following diagrams depict these requirements: 
 
 
(C) ?Spacing driveways. Access must be by defined driveways; continuous access along the street 
frontage is prohibited. Driveways will be limited to the number needed to provide adequate and 
reasonable access to the property. 
    The "Points of Access" Guidelines in the SCDOT Access and Roadside Management Standards 
Manual must be closely adhered to. In all cases, traffic conditions, to include speed, flow, visibility, and 
street characteristics, must be considered. 
    On streets not owned by the Town of Lexington, driveway approval must be obtained from the street 
owner and the Town. 
    Separation between driveways accessing adjacent properties in different ownership shall be based 
on the following table, measured from radius to radius, and based upon the classification of the road 
accessed: 
Arterial: 50 feet. 
Collector: 40 feet. 
Local: 30 feet. 
However, when applicable standards cannot physically be met (for example, in a cul-de-sac), the Zoning 
Administrator has the authority to allow a lower standard. 
    The following shall be the minimum distance allowed between driveways when more than one 
driveway is proposed to access a parcel. Spacing shall be measured from radius to radius and based 
upon the classification of the road accessed. The distance may be halved for one-way entrance and exit 
drives provided the entrance drive is upstream of the traffic from the exit drive. 
Arterial: 40 feet. 
Collector: 30 feet. 
Local: 20 feet. 
(D) ?Right in/right out ingresses and egresses. The Town has the authority to require right in/right out 
ingresses and egresses where there are multiple driveways on a parcel, at least one of which allows 
for standard ingress/egress. 
(E) ?Safety vehicles. Driveways must be designed to allow safety vehicles, which at a minimum means 
that the driveway must be at least eighteen feet (18') wide. 
(F) ?Connectivity of parking lots. New commercial development projects must connect to existing parking 
lots. The Approving Authority can refuse zoning permits or project approval on the basis that the 
project does not connect to existing adjacent parking lots. However, where the Approving Authority 
finds that the public interest is better served with respect to safety and traffic flow and other 
considerations that affect the public health, safety, and general welfare by not having such 
interconnectivity, the Approving Authority may grant zoning permits or approve projects that do not 
have such connectivity. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.06.02 - PRIVATE ROADS. 
    The Town of Lexington cannot take ownership of or maintain a private road. 
    Private roads may be allowed in the Town of Lexington if all of the following conditions are met: 
(A) ?The deed or covenants that are recorded by the Lexington County Register of Deeds stipulate 
that the Town of Lexington can never own or maintain the road. 
(B) ?The road is built to the Town of Lexington standards, specification and in accordance with 
plans approved by the Approving Authority or its designee. 
(C) ?The Town of Lexington receives a letter of certification from a registered engineer that the road 
is built to the Town of Lexington standards and specification. 
(D) ?A road maintenance agreement must be approved by the Approving Authority and Town 
Attorney. If these provisions are incorporated into a master deed or other document containing 
covenants and restrictions for a subdivision, that document may be submitted in addition to a 
road agreement. The property owners' association must be chartered with the Secretary of 
State for South Carolina for the purpose of implementing this agreement and that by-laws be 
developed for the operation of that association. 
(E) ?If the private road is gated, that officials of the Town of Lexington have access to the gate code 
or other mechanism twenty-four (24) hours a day. 
Note: Nonpaved private roads are not allowed in the Town of Lexington. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.06.03 - MINIMUM BUILDING SEPARATION. 
    Minimum building separation on a zone lot shall be in accordance with the building codes adopted by 
the Town of Lexington at the time of construction. With the exception of a residential parcel, buildings 
shall not be located on a parcel in such a way as to impair access to emergency vehicles, meaning that:

    For the purposes of this Ordinance, impact noises shall be considered to be those noises whose 
peak values are more than three (3) decibels higher than the values indicated on the sound level meter. 
    Between the hours of seven (7:00) p.m. and seven (7:00) a.m., all of the permissible noise levels 
indicated in the previous table for adjacent residential use or adjacent protected district boundaries shall 
be reduced by five (5) decibels. 
    Noises not directly attributable to an activity located on the same parcel are excluded from the above 
limitations (such as transportation activities on public roads). 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


DIVISION 3. - VIBRATION 


§ 155.13.01 - DEFINITIONS. 
    "Displacement" means the amount of motion involved in earth-born vibration. It is referenced to the 
normal rest position of the earth and is, therefore, one-half (0.5) of the total excursion for a steady-state 
vibration. Displacement is usually reported in inches (or decimal fraction of an inch). 
    "Frequency" means the number of times that a displacement completely repeats itself in one second 
of time. Frequency is designated in cycles per second, abbreviated as cps. 
    "Impact vibration" means an earth-born vibration produced by two (2) or more objects (or parts of a 
machine) striking each other. 
    "Particle velocity" means a characteristic of vibration, which depends on both displacement and 
frequency. If not directly measured, it can be computed by the following formula: Particle velocity (inches 
per second) equals 6.28 times frequency (cycles per second) times displacement (inches). 
    "Steady state" means a noise or vibration which is continuous, such as from a fan or compressor. 
    "Vibration" means a reciprocating movement transmitted through the earth. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.13.02 - METHOD OF MEASUREMENT. 
    The instruments to be used for these vibration measurements shall be recording instruments that 
simultaneously record vibration in three (3) mutually perpendicular directions (vectors). They may record 
either particle velocity versus time or displacement versus time. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.13.03 - MAXIMUM PERMITTED VIBRATION LEVELS. 
    The maximum permitted vibration across property lines or district boundaries shall be in accordance 
with the following table. Numbers listed represent the maximum allowable particle velocity 
(inches/second), which shall be the vector sum of three (3) mutually perpendicular components recorded 
simultaneously.

    For the purposes of this Ordinance, steady-state vibrations are vibrations which are continuous or 
vibrate in discrete impulses more frequent than sixty (60) per minute. Discrete impulses that do not 
exceed sixty (60) per minute shall be considered impact vibrations. 
    Between the hours of seven (7:00) p.m. and seven (7:00) a.m., all of the permissible vibration levels 
indicated in the previous table for adjacent residential use or protected district boundaries shall be 
reduced to one-half (0.5) of the indicated values. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


DIVISION 4. - TOXIC MATTER AND HAZARDOUS WASTE 


§ 155.14.01 - DEFINITIONS. 
    "Hazardous waste" means materials or substances that pose a threat to living organisms through 
chemical contamination of the ecosystem. 
    "Toxic matter" means materials or substances that, either singly or in combination with other 
materials or substances, through synergistic action, pose a threat to the health of human beings, either 
acutely or chronically. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.14.02 - DETERMINATION OF MATERIAL STATUS. 
    The determination that a material or substance is either toxic or poses a threat as a hazardous waste 
shall be based upon the listing published by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic 
Substances Control Act of 1976 and the rules and regulations promulgated for identification of such by 
the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07)

or produce hazardous waste in the process of manufacturing, fabricating, assembling, packaging or any 
related activity shall provide to the Approving Authority a certificate from either the Bureau of Solid and 
Industrial Waste Management or the Compliance and Enforcement Division of the NPDES Permits 
Administration of DHEC, or both, indicating compliance with the rules and regulations administrated by 
those agencies. Only until such certification is received from DHEC shall the facility be permitted for 
occupancy. 
    Nothing contained herein shall be intended to preempt or abrogate the requirements for a user of 
toxic material or generator of hazardous waste to adhere to the administration and procedural 
requirements of state or federal agencies with regard to environmental protection. 
    Any facility proposing to locate within the corporate limits of the Town that would utilize toxic material 
or produce hazardous waste shall provide a list of such toxic materials or hazardous wastes to the Town 
indicating the nature and amount of such material, the method of use or storage and any other pertinent 
information which might prove useful in firefighting or civil defense planning or emergency situations. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.14.04 - SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS. 
    Notwithstanding the requirements of State and Federal agencies charged with the administration of 
the rules and regulations governing the operation of facilities utilizing toxic matter or generating or storing 
hazardous waste, any facility handling such identified material shall provide an on-site containment area 
for the material so that a leak or spill is contained entirely on the facility's property and thus prevented 
from entering the surface or subsurface drainage system, manmade or natural, which serves the Town. 
The responsibility for the review of the containment structure or device as to design and acceptability 
shall reside with the Approving Authority who may rely upon expertise provided by the Town's engineer or 
other agency as necessary to ascertain satisfaction that the proposed structure or device will provide 
compliance with the spirit and intent of this section. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.14.05 - LIST OF MATERIALS. 
    Materials and substances considered as either toxic matter or hazardous waste shall be those 
contained within the listing published by the Environmental Protection Agency, as amended, under the 
provision of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. A further listing of such materials is found in

(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.15.03 - LIGHT AND GLARE. 
(A) ?Definitions. 
    "Footcandle" means a unit of illumination. Technically, the illumination at all points one foot distant 
from a uniform point source of one candlepower. 
    "Glare" means the disturbing quality of direct illumination which, although not necessarily providing a 
measurable amount of light from a given vantage point, nonetheless is an attractive nuisance to the eye 
to the point of causing discomfort when viewed. 
(B) ?Lighting plans. It is strongly suggested that developers submit lighting plans to the Town for review 
to avoid enforcement action of noncompliant projects after they are constructed. 
(C) ?Limitation of illumination. In all zoning districts, any operation or activity producing light from a 
nonmobile source (cars, trucks and other vehicles traveling on the highways, etc., are exempt) shall 
not cause illumination in excess of one footcandle when measured in a Protected District or across 
the property line of an adjacent residential use, or onto the traffic lanes of public roads. 
(D) ?Limitation of glare. While it is impossible to totally eliminate glare, it is the intent of this Ordinance to 
reduce the effect as much as possible within reason. In all zoning districts, any activity potentially 
producing glare from a nonmobile source shall be constructed so that glare is not directed into a 
Protected District or across the property line of an adjacent residential use, or into traffic lanes of 
public roads. Such glare may be produced from a shiny surface, such as sunlight reflecting off a roof. 
Pole-mounted lighting fixtures are encouraged to be located along the perimeter of the area to be 
illuminated so that the direction of the light may be inward, away from the property lines. Certain 
fixtures, as determined by the Administrative Official, must be shielded to mitigate the effects of 
glare. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.15.04 - ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE. 
    No operation or activity shall be conducted in any zoning district that causes electrical disturbances 
to be transmitted across adjacent residential property lines or across the boundaries of Protected 
Districts. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.15.05 - SMOKE AND PARTICULATE MATTER. 
    Activities that produce smoke or particulate matter shall abide by the regulation of the South Carolina 
Department of Health and Environmental Control under authority granted by the Pollution Control Act. 
Reference is made to Regulation 61-62, appended to the South Carolina Code of Laws of 1976, as 
amended.

ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMITY 


DIVISION 1. - GENERAL 


§ 155.16.01 - PURPOSE. 
    The purpose of this regulation is to control, improve or terminate uses of land that do not conform to 
one or more of the applicable provisions of this Ordinance. These regulations shall apply to all 
nonconformities including use nonconformities and area nonconformities as defined in § 155.18.01 
(General Description). 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07; Ord. 2009-14, § 1, passed 6-1-09) 


§ 155.16.02 - RIGHT TO CONTINUE NONCONFORMITY. 
    A nonconformity that is lawfully in existence at the time of the enactment of this Ordinance or any 
subsequent amendment thereto which may create such nonconformity may be continued and maintained 
except as otherwise specified herein. No expansion, extension, substitution, enlargement or other change 
in a nonconforming activity is allowed except as expressly required by law or permitted herein. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.16.03 - NONCONFORMITIES WITHIN THE FLOODPLAIN OR FLOODWAY. 
    In all zoning districts or portions thereof which extend into the Drainage and Floodplain Special 
Overlay District as established by this Ordinance, any building or other structure or use which is not 
permitted in the floodplain or floodway shall become nonconforming upon the effective date of this 
Ordinance or subsequent amendment as applicable. 
    A building or other structure that is nonconforming by reason of location within the floodplain or 
floodway shall not be enlarged or structurally improved in such a manner that would increase the hazard 
of flooding or extend the normal life of the nonconforming building or other structure. Such nonconforming 
building or other structure, if used for human habitation, shall not be extended to accommodate additional 
occupants. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


DIVISION 2. - NONCONFORMING USE 


§ 155.17.01 - GENERAL DESCRIPTION. 
    This division shall regulate uses that are not permitted by zoning district or street classification or do 
not meet the other requirements of this Ordinance (e.g., setbacks, buffers, parking requirements, etc.). If 
the use is not permitted by zoning district or street classification, the nonconformity is called a "use 
nonconformity." If the use is allowed under the zoning district and street classification but does not meet 
the other requirements of this Ordinance (e.g., setbacks, buffers, parking requirements, etc.), the 
nonconformity is called an "area nonconformity." 
    For the purposes of this Ordinance, a change in ownership does not constitute a change in use. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07) 


§ 155.17.02 - ABANDONMENT OF NONCONFORMITY. 
    Whenever a use nonconformity is discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive months, the activity shall 
not be allowed to resume. Any future activity must be a conforming use. 
    Whenever an activity that is not a use nonconformity but that is an area nonconformity is 
discontinued for any length of time as a result of something other than damage or destruction of 
structures, the activity or an activity with the same or lesser intensity shall be allowed to resume, whether 
or not the area nonconformity is addressed such that it conforms with the requirements of the Zoning 
Ordinance in place at the time. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07; Ord. 2009-14, § 2, passed 6-1-09) 


§ 155.17.03 - DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION OF STRUCTURES. 
    If a structure accommodating a nonconformity, whether a use or area nonconformity, is damaged or 
destroyed to the extent that the cost of reconstruction, repair or replacement exceeds fifty percent (50%) 
of the total replacement value of the structure immediately prior to the damage, the structure shall not be 
restored to its original state of nonconformity notwithstanding the exception listed in part B below. 
(A) ?If the nonconformity is a use nonconformity, any future activity must be a conforming use. 
(B) ?If the nonconformity is an area nonconformity, the activity shall be allowed to resume only if the 
area nonconformity is addressed such that it conforms with the requirements of the Zoning 
Ordinance in place at the time unless the area nonconformity existed on June 1, 2009, in which 
case the activity shall be allowed to resume. 
    If such rebuilding would constitute less than fifty percent (50%) of the replacement value of the 
structure immediately prior to its damage, follow the requirements of § 155.17.04. 
    The total replacement value of the structure prior to damage or destruction shall be determined by 
the Administrative Official utilizing public tax records as the basis for such determination. 
(Ord. 2007-34, § 1, passed 10-1-07; Ord. 2009-14, § 2, passed 6-1-09) 


§ 155.17.04 - REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS OF STRUCTURES. 
    This section deals with damage and destruction where the cost of repair, reconstruction, or 
replacement is less than fifty percent (50%) of the total replacement value of the structure immediately 
prior to the damage. 
(A) ?Use nonconformities. Structures housing a use nonconformity may be repaired and altered 
subject to the following provisions: 
(1) ?Preliminary plan approval for the restoration must be obtained within one year after 
damage or destruction. If it is not, then the structure shall be considered abandoned and 
shall be subject to the provisions of § 155.18.02. 
(2) ?Restoration, if it is external, must meet the Town's architectural and appearance 
standards if the parcel in question is subject to those standards. 
(B) ?Area nonconformities. Any structure housing an area nonconformity but not a use 
nonconformity may be repaired and altered subject to the following provisions: 
(1) ?The repair or alteration cannot increase the degree of nonconformity.

(Ord. 99-017 § 2 (§ 3-6.0), passed 4-5-99) 


§ 156.04.03 - REQUIRED DESIGN ELEMENTS. 
(A) ?Screening is a vegetative or man-made wall/fence. Screening may be required with or without a 
landscaped zone. Man-made screening structures (i.e., wood, masonry) shall be eight feet (8') in 
height and at least ninety percent (90%) opaque. Vegetative screening shall be equal to or greater 
than man-made structures. 
    When property owners of abutting properties, which require said screening, state in writing to the 
Landscaping and Tree Ordinance Administrator their displeasure of this screening requirement; the 
Landscaping and Tree Ordinance Administrator may act as a mediator between the parties for mutual 
relief. If no such mutual agreement can be met, then the screening requirement stands as previously 
written. 
(B) ?A minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of all plant materials for the landscape zones shall be 
drought resistant evergreen varieties. In addition the following shall be included: 
(1) ?Required landscape zones shall contain at least one of the following groups of plant material at 
a minimum average density of one group for every thirty-five feet (35'), or portion thereof, of 
landscape zone:

(Ord. 99-017 § 2 (§ 3-7.0), passed 4-5-99; Ord. 2001-08, passed 5-7-01) 


UTILITIES AND SERVICE AREAS 


§ 156.05.01 - PURPOSE. 
    All service areas shall be screened from public view. Sections 156.05.01 and 156.05.02 shall apply 
to all utility lines, stormwater management systems (i.e., detention ponds), garbage collection sites, 
exposed nonpower utility fixtures, power utility substations and exposed metal cabinets over five feet (5') 
in height or other related fixtures which serve the purpose of conducting communications (i.e., voice, data 
or visual images). 
(Ord. 99-017 § 2 (§ 4-1.0), passed 4-5-99) 


§ 156.05.02 - REQUIRED DESIGN ELEMENTS. 
(A) ?All garbage collection sites and containers shall be shielded on all sides by screening that is ninety 
percent (90%) opaque and at least one foot (1') higher than the item, but not less than six feet (6').

service provider and applicant; all new construction or renovations of an existing building which 
involves expansion of building area of more than fifty percent (50%), utility service shall provide the 
underground utility infrastructure necessary to connect to utility service(s) at the property line. See §§ 
156.06.01 through 156.07.03 regarding installation of utilities within or through a tree protection 
zone. 
(C) ?All other utility fixtures over five feet (5') in height and substations installed or constructed shall be 
screened from all proposed, future, private and public streets and adjoining PRD zoned property to 
the extent practicable after consideration of proper equipment operation, code compliance, access 
and maintenance. 
(D) ?All detention ponds or holding areas that are part of the site storm/surface water system shall be 
landscaped or screened from view from any proposed, future, private or public street and adjoining 
property. The quantity and type of landscaping and/or screen shall be at the discretion of the 
Administrator. This determination will be based on the following factors: 
(1) ?Location and proximity to view from proposed, future, private and public streets; 
(2) ?Proximity and use of adjoining property; 
(3) ?Nature and use (i.e., detention vs. retention); 
(4) ?Overall size and depth;

(Ord. 99-017 § 2 (§ 4-2.0), passed 4-5-99) 


TREE RETENTION 


§ 156.06.01 - PURPOSE. 
    The purpose of §§ 156.06.01 through 156.07.03 is to discourage the complete removal of existing 
trees from a site during the land development process. The practice of clear cutting building sites 
destroys the balance of nature, leads to sedimentation and erosion, contributes to air and water pollution 
and unnecessarily robs the community of valuable assets. 
(Ord. 99-017 § 2 (§ 5-1.0), passed 4-5-99) 


§ 156.06.02 - TREE APPROVAL APPLICATION. 
(A) ?It is recommended that an applicant for development that will require existing tree cover to be 
removed schedule a preapplication conference with the Administrator. This meeting should be held 
prior to submitting an application for site development (i.e., building permit). 
(B) ?A tree survey is required for all parcels that will be modified that have existing trees (see § 
156.09.02(D)). 
(C) ?Approval is required to remove any specimen tree anywhere on the property. 
(D) ?A minimum of thirty-five percent (35%) of the trees four inches (4") to eight inches (8") D.B.H. within 
the required perimeter and perimeter landscape zones and twenty five percent (25%) of the trees 
over eight inches (8") D.B.H. within the required street frontage, perimeter and perimeter landscape 
zones shall be retained and planned for during the land development process. A minimum of twenty 
(20) trees per acre must be maintained. 
(E) ?It is a violation to remove any trees with a D.B.H. of four inches (4") or greater within the street 
frontage, perimeter and perimeter landscape yards prior to development. 
(F) ?In an exceptional case where the Administrator determines that an individual tree or grouping of 
trees is of very high value and virtually irreplaceable, approval is required for removal (i.e., live oaks, 
exceptional Native species, or trees of historical importance to the Town). 
(Ord. 99-017 § 2 (§ 5-2.0), passed 4-5-99) 


§ 156.06.03 - JUSTIFICATION FOR REMOVAL OF SPECIMEN OR PROTECTED TREES. 
    Criteria are listed below for determining whether removal of a protected tree should be approved. 
These criteria may be applied with varying degrees of stringency depending upon the value of the 
particular tree, but in no event shall retention of a tree or trees be required if reasonable use of the 
property will be significantly impaired. At its option, the Administrator may require replacement planting for 
trees which have been approved for removal. The replacement requirements will be based on an "inch for 
inch" basis or greater. 
(A) ?Criteria for removal. 
(1) ?Presentation of a safety hazard to pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
(2) ?Presentation of a safety hazard to building, structures or utility infrastructures; 
(3) ?Removal being the only reasonable means by which to comply with certain governmental 
requirements; 
(4) ?Justification according to good urban forestry and forestry practice (i.e., to reduce 
competition among trees or to remove invasive exotic species); 
(5) ?Any tree the Administrator certifies in writing as being structurally unsound, hazardous, 
diseased, dead or in a state of irreversible decline; 
(6) ?Consideration should also be given to the size and species of the tree and overall tree 
coverage (existing and proposed) on the site; 
(7) ?If tree retention and/or tree protection zone(s) prevents the minimum number of required 
parking spaces by the Town's zoning ordinance, Chapter 155; 
(8) ?If the ingress/egress approved by the governing agency cannot reasonably be located to 
adequately accommodate the required root area of the protected tree(s); 
(9) ?Other required utility infrastructures cannot reasonably be located to accommodate the 
protected tree(s) (i.e., stormwater systems, detention ponds, etc.); 
(10) ?The introduction of fill twelve inches (12") or greater to elevate the parcel above the 
required flood protection elevation; 
(11) ?A planned grade cut that would place the tree protection zone above four feet (4') above 
final grade; 
(12) ?Reasonable use of the property will be significantly impaired; 
(13) ?Specimen size pine and pecan trees located within the interior of the parcel are exempt 
from tree retention requirements. 
(Ord. 99-017 § 2 (§ 5-3.0), passed 4-5-99) 


TREE RETENTION AND THE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 


§ 156.07.01 - PURPOSE. 
    The purpose of §§ 156.06.01 through 156.07.03 shall be to establish minimum standards for the 
retention of trees and protection of their root systems during the land development process. 
(Ord. 99-017 § 2 (§ 5-4.0), passed 4-5-99) 


§ 156.07.02 - REQUIRED DESIGN ELEMENTS. 
(A) ?Tree protection zone size. All tree protection zones shall be based on a combination of the trees 
dripline and D.B.H. One and one-half feet (1½') per inch of D.B.H. or the trees dripline, whichever is 
greater shall be used. However, once a site inspection is completed, it shall be at the discretion of 
the Administrator to adjust the placement, type and size of the physical barriers. The tree protection 
zone is determined by the size of the canopy and other environmental factors not shown on the tree 
survey. 
(B) ?Tree protection zone drainage. It shall be at the discretion of the Administrator to require proper 
drainage for protected trees where grade changes adjacent to the tree protection zone create poor 
drainage for the tree(s) (i.e., area adjacent is filled and tree protection zone is placed below grade, 
thereby, creating a well/pond). 
(C) ?See § 156.09.02, Plan requirements. 
(D) ?Following the review of all required site plans, the Administrator shall either approve, approve with 
conditions or disapprove the landscaping and tree plans. 
(E) ?Landscaping and tree plan approval does not authorize any tree removal or site development 
activity of any kind until such time that the Zoning Administrator approves the issuance of a permit 
for such work. 
(Ord. 99-017 § 2 (§ 5-5.0), passed 4-5-99)

    Prior to the commencement of any clearing, grading, tree removal or construction on a site, the 
following shall be completed: 
(A) ?Uniform colored ribbon system. 
(1) ?Blue ribbon for trees to be retained; 
(2) ?Red ribbon for trees to be removed. 
(B) ?Passive forms. At the discretion of the Administrator, passive forms of ribbon marking and tree 
protection zones may be used (i.e., continuous rope or flagging for areas which are remote from 
human activity or heavily wooded). 
(C) ?Tree protection zone. A tree protection zone for any trees within twenty-five feet (25') of any 
proposed grading, clearing, tree removal or construction shall be established by physical 
barriers and maintained until such work is completed. Placement and types of barriers shall be 
at the discretion of the Administrator. There shall be no activity of any type within the tree 
protection zone (i.e., grading, storing materials, trenching, digging, site office, parking 
equipment/vehicles, chemical, or cement rinsing, etc.). 
(D) ?Signage. The placement of tree protection or keep out signage shall be attached to the 
physical barrier and maintained until all construction activities are completed. The placement 
and quantity of signage shall be on all sides and convey the intent of the tree protection zone 
and barriers. 
(E) ?Utilities. Underground utilities shall be routed around tree protection zones. Necessary 
installation through protection zones shall be accomplished through tunneling rather than cutting 
open trenches. This applies to any irrigation systems, drainage, electric, gas, telephone, cable 
TV, etc. 
(F) ?Entry. Entry into or through a tree protection zone shall be approved by the Administrator. 
Twenty-four-hour notice is required. 
(G) ?Tree damage. Any tree damaged before, during or after construction shall be treated 
according to accepted International Society of Aboriculture practices. Such treatment(s) shall 
occur prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Required treatments as well as the 
planting of additional trees that are damaged or destroyed shall be at the discretion of the 
Administrator. 
(H) ?Pruning. All tree pruning required for construction or equipment operation or otherwise shall 
meet all National Arborist Association and International Society of Arboriculture Standards. All 
tree roots outside of the tree protection zone/barriers removed during construction shall be 
severed clean. 
(I) ?Watering. During periods of dry weather or drought, supplemental watering of tree protection 
zones shall be required during the land development process. The quantity and frequency shall 
be at the discretion of the Administrator. 
(J) ?Tree/undergrowth removal. All approved underbrush and/or tree removals within all protected 
areas (street frontage, perimeter, perimeter landscape zones) shall be completed in a manner 
that will reduce injury to trees and undergrowth to be retained (i.e., canopy or root damage). 
Removal method shall be at the determination of the Administrator.

(2) ?The amount of impervious and pervious surface remaining on the property; 
(3) ?Tree retention requirements; 
(4) ?The feasibility to increase street frontage(s), perimeter(s) and perimeter landscape zone(s). 
(C) ?The Administrator may recommend a contribution to the Town of Lexington's tree fund when it is 
found that strict compliance would impose excessive hardship and practical difficulty on the property 
owner. The applicant must request the contribution, in writing, to the Administrator prior to any site 
work being started. The contribution to the tree fund shall be based upon evidence that: 
(1) ?Granting of the tree fund contribution will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or 
welfare; 
(2) ?The request for the tree fund contribution is based on particular conditions of size, shape or 
topography of the property that are limiting as to the application of this chapter; 
(3) ?Strict compliance would impose a particular hardship and not a mere inconvenience; 
(4) ?The granting of the tree fund contribution will not violate the provision of any other ordinance; 
and 
(5) ?The request is not solely to alleviate financial hardship. 
(6) ?Upon granting the contribution to the Town tree fund, the Town shall receive from the applicant 
a contribution to the Town tree fund to be used to plant trees on public lands. Contributions to 
the tree fund shall be calculated based on the following formula: 
(a) ?Measure the perimeter of the property and divide by thirty-five (35). That equals the 
number (rounded up) of trees that would be required for the street frontage and perimeter. 
(b) ?Take the number of parking spaces and divide by eight (8). That equals the number 
(rounded up) of trees that would be required for the parking lot interior. 
(c) ?Add subsections (C)(6)(a) and (C)(6)(b) of this section to find the total number of trees 
required. Subtract any trees planted to meet the ordinance regulations. 
(d) ?Multiply the number of trees required times two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to 
determine the contribution to the tree fund. 
(e) ?The prices set in subsection (C)(6)(d) of this section are based on 1998 market prices. 
Each subsequent year thereafter the consumer price index adjustment shall be added to 
the amount per tree paid to the Town. 
(7) ?Once a property pays into the tree fund, it will be considered in compliance. If a change in use, 
activity or parcel size occurs, the property shall be reevaluated by the Administrator for 
compliance. 
(D) ?Emergency situations. During an emergency, such as hurricane, tornado, flood or other act(s) of 
nature, the requirements of this chapter may be waived by the Town Council for a period of days 
determined by Town Council. This chapter in no way prevents the reestablishment, repair or 
replacement of any primary utility service during or after such emergencies. 
(E) ?Maintenance. 
(1) ?The property owner shall be responsible for regular grounds maintenance (mowing, weeding, 
pruning, irrigating) and other maintenance of screening structures required to comply with this 
chapter. Any required plant shown on the approved landscape or tree preservation plan that 
dies must be replaced with an approved living plant complying with this chapter within forty-five 
(45) days after notification by the Administrator. This replanting deadline can be extended at the 
discretion of the Administrator due to environmental factors (i.e., extreme heat, drought or other 
weather conditions not conductive for planting). All proposed watering methods, irrigation or 
otherwise, must be adequate to maintain plant material in a healthy growing condition at all 
times. 
(2) ?The owner shall not take any measures which will prevent plant material from reaching 
minimum mature sizes required by this chapter (i.e., improper pruning, growth regulators, etc.).

§ 156.11.03 - INTERIOR SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT. 
(A) ?Residential subdivisions should be designed to minimize removal of any specimen trees and dense 
stands of hardwood trees. Streets and lots should be laid out, to the extent practical, so as not to site 
these trees and stands in the roads or in the center of lots. 
(B) ?Residential subdivisions shall set aside certain natural areas reserved as common land in the 
subdivision as per the following formula: 
(1) ?Average lot size zero to one-half (½) acre requires five percent (5%) of the subdivision's total 
land mass to be set aside for natural development and preservation. 
(2) ?Average lot size greater than one-half (½) acre but less than one acre requires three percent 
(3%) of the subdivision's total land mass to be set aside for natural development and 
preservation. 
(3) ?Average lot size equal to or greater than one acre requires no such set-aside. 
(C) ?Water surface acreage does not count towards this allotment. The typical set-aside will consist of 
the native forest of that particular land and any wetlands. The set aside should be designed so as to 
include any hardwood tree stands and specimen trees. These percentages referred to in this chapter 
can be included in or in addition to the open space recreation requirements of § 154.06.13 of the 
subdivision regulations and §§ 155.07.08 and 155.11.15 of the zoning ordinance, Chapter 155.

subject matter, and derived from Ord. 2015-32 , § 1(Att.), passed Nov. 2, 2015. 


GENERAL STANDARDS 


§ 157.01.00 - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. 
    The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code of Laws, Title 5 and Title 6, and 
amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations 
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Council 
of the Town of Lexington, South Carolina does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.01.10 - FINDINGS OF FACT. 
    The special flood hazard areas of the Town of Lexington are subject to periodic inundation which 
results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental 
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, 
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains 
causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses 
vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or 
otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.01.20 - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and 
encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood 
conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be 
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are 
dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood 
heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the 
alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the 
accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may 
increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood 
barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base 
by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize 
flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
The provisions of the chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as 
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, 
and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter 
is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts 
associated with flooding. 
    Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as 
temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, 
groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational 
opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural 
state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and 
water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and 
stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions 
and human needs. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.01.30 - LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Town of 
Lexington as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance 
Study, dated July 5, 2018 with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by 
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
    Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study for the unincorporated areas of Lexington County, with 
accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.01.40 - ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the 
commencement of any development activities. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.01.50 - COMPLIANCE. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without 
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.01.60 - INTERPRETATION. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be considered as minimum 
requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal 
any other powers granted under State law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any 
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or 
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions, shall prevail. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.01.70 - PARTIAL INVALIDITY AND SEVERABILITY. 
    If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the remainder of the chapter shall not be affected and 
shall remain in force. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.01.80 - WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory 
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on 
rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not 
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free 
from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Lexington 
or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or 
any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.01.90 - PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including 
violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special 
exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with 
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars 
($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall 
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Town of Lexington from 
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

safety, is essential to the orderly functioning of a community, store or produce highly volatile, 
toxic or water-reactive materials, or house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid 
loss of life or injury. Examples of critical development include jails, hospitals, schools, fire 
stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, water plants, and gas/oil/propane 
storage facilities. 
11. ?"Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, 
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, 
paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
12. ?"Elevated building" means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated 
above the ground level by means of solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or 
shear walls parallel to the flow of water. 
13. ?"Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)." Issued by President Carter in 1977, this 
order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect 
identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.

start of construction commenced before May 01, 1980. 
15. ?"Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision" means a manufactured 
home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which 
the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, 
the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is 
completed before July 5, 1995. 
16. ?"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of 
additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured 
homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and 
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs). 
17. ?"Flood" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally 
dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the unusual and rapid accumulation 
of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
18. ?"Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" means an official map of a community, issued by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood 
hazard have been defined as Zone A. 
19. ?"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map of a community, on which the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard 
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
20. ?"Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency

Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
21. ?"Flood-resistant material" means any building material capable of withstanding direct and 
prolonged contact (minimum seventy-two (72) hours) with floodwaters without sustaining 
damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or 
is not resistant to alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not 
flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable 
flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict evaporation from below and 
materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that 
absorb or retain water excessively after submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to 
Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and 
available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Class 4 and 5 materials, 
referenced therein, are acceptable flood-resistant materials. 
22. ?"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that 
must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water 
surface elevation more than one foot. 
23. ?"Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for 
purposes of flood plain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown 
factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected 
size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological 
effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
24. ?"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless 
it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, 
port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship 
building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related 
manufacturing facilities. 
25. ?"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to 
construction, next to the proposed walls of the structure. 
26. ?"Historic structure" means any structure that is: (a) listed individually in the National Register of 
Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)) or 
preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for 
individual listing on the National Register; (b) certified or preliminarily determined by the 
Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic 
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic 
district; (c) individually listed on a State inventory of historic places; (d) individually listed on a 
local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have 
been certified (1) by an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or 
(2) directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs. Some structures or 
districts listed on the State or local inventories may not be "historic" as cited above, but have 
been included on the inventories because it was believed that the structures or districts have 
the potential for meeting the "historic" structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures 
to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced that the South 
Carolina Department of Archives and History has individually determined that the structure or 
district meets DOI historic structure criteria. 
27. ?"Increased cost of compliance (ICC)" applies to all new and renewed flood insurance policies 
effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover 
the cost of compliance with land use and control measures established under Section 1361. It 
provides coverage for the payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with State or 
community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a building 
has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged. 
28. ?"Limited storage" means an area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental 
items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such 
an area must be of flood resistant or breakaway material, void of utilities except for essential 
lighting and cannot be temperature controlled. If the area is located below the base flood 
elevation in an A, AE and A1-A30 Zone it must meet the requirements of § 157.04.00 of this 
chapter. 
29. ?"Lowest adjacent grade (LAG)" is an elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any 
deck support, exterior walls of a building or proposed building walls. 
30. ?"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An 
unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or 
storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; 
provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the 
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter. 
31. ?"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built 
on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when 
connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a 
"recreational vehicle". 
32. ?"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land 
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
33. ?"Mean sea level" means, for the purpose of this chapter, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum 
(NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which the 
base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) are shown. 
34. ?"National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929" means as corrected in 1929, elevation 
reference points set by National Geodetic Survey based on mean sea level. 
35. ?"North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988" means vertical control, as corrected in 1988, 
used as the reference datum on Flood Insurance Rate Maps. 
36. ?"New construction" means structure for which the start of construction commenced on or after 
July 5, 1995. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structure. 
37. ?"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or 
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the 
manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the 
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs) is 
completed on or after July 5, 1995. 
38. ?"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: (a) built on a single chassis; (b) four hundred 
(400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; (c) designed to be 
self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and, (d) designed primarily not for 
use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, 
or seasonal use. 
39. ?"Repetitive loss" means a building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred 
flood-related damages on two (2) occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the 
event for which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the 
average, equaled or exceeded twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the building at 
the time of each such flood event. 
40. ?"Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968." The Act provides that no new 
flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local authority to be in violation of 
state or local ordinances. 
41. ?"Stable natural vegetation" means the first place on the oceanfront where plants such as sea 
oats hold sand in place. 
42. ?"Start of construction" means for other than new construction or substantial improvements 
under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and 
means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, 
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) 
days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of 
a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, 
installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the 
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include 
land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of 
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or foundations, or the 
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory 
buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main 
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first 
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that 
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
43. ?"Structure" means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a gas or 
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
44. ?"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost 
of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent 
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Such repairs may be 
undertaken successively and their costs counted cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of 
"substantial improvement". 
45. ?"Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other 
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the 
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term 
includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the 
actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
a) ?Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing violations of State or local 
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code 
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions 
or, 
b) ?Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the 
structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five (5) years. If the improvement project is 
conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the 
issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial 
improvement" will occur. 
46. ?"Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means where the 
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or 
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, 
reconstruction, or improvement commenced. 
47. ?"Variance" is a grant of relief from a term or terms of this chapter. 
48. ?"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with 
these regulations.

certification from a registered, professional engineer or architect that the non-residential, 
floodproofed structure meets the floodproofing criteria in the non-residential construction 
requirements of § 157.04.10.B and § 157.04.40. 
b) ?Certification during construction. A lowest floor elevation or floodproofing certification is required 
after the lowest floor is completed. As soon as possible after completion of the lowest floor and 
before any further vertical construction commences, or floodproofing by whatever construction 
means, whichever is applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the local 
Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, or floodproofed 
elevation, whichever is applicable, as built, in relation to mean sea level. Said certification shall 
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional 
engineer and certified by it. Any work done prior to submission of the certification shall be at the 
permit holder's risk. The local Floodplain Administrator shall review the floor elevation survey 
data submitted. The permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being 
permitted to proceed shall correct deficiencies detected by such review. Failure to submit the 
survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work 
order for the project. 
c) ?As-built certification. Upon completion of the development a registered professional engineer, 
land surveyor or architect, in accordance with SC law, shall certify according to the 
requirements of § 157.03.20.2a and 2b that the development is built in accordance with the

necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval 
is required by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control 
Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334. 
3. ?Watercourse alterations. 
a) ?Notify adjacent communities and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, 
Land, Water, and Conservation Division, State Coordinator for the National Flood 
Insurance Program, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit 
evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
b) ?In addition to the notifications required watercourse alterations per § 157.03.30, written 
reports of maintenance records must be maintained to show that maintenance has been 
provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-
carrying capacity is maintained. This maintenance must consist of a comprehensive 
program of periodic inspections, and routine channel clearing and dredging, or other 
related functions. The assurance shall consist of a description of maintenance activities, 
frequency of performance, and the local official responsible for maintenance performance. 
Records shall be kept on file for FEMA inspection. 
c) ?If the proposed project will modify the configuration of the watercourse, floodway, or base 
flood elevation for which a detailed Flood Insurance Study has been developed, the 
applicant shall apply for and must receive approval for a conditional letter of map revision 
with the Federal Emergency Management Agency prior to the start of construction. 
d) ?Within sixty (60) days of completion of an alteration of a watercourse, referenced in the 
certification requirements of § 157.03.20, the applicant shall submit as-built certification, by 
a registered professional engineer, to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
4. ?Floodway encroachments. Prevent encroachments within floodways unless the certification and 
flood hazard reduction provisions of § 157.04.10.E are met. 
5. ?Adjoining floodplains. Cooperate with neighboring communities with respect to the management 
of adjoining floodplains and/or flood-related erosion areas in order to prevent aggravation of 
existing hazards. 
6. ?Notifying adjacent communities. Notify adjacent communities prior to permitting substantial 
commercial developments and large subdivisions to be undertaken in areas of special flood 
hazard and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
7. ?Certification requirements. 
a) ?Obtain and review actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor of all 
new or substantially improved structures, in accordance with administrative procedures 
outlined in § 157.03.20. 
b) ?Obtain the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially 
improved structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with the floodproofing 
certification outlined in § 157.03.20. 
c) ?When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain certifications from a 
registered professional engineer or architect in accordance with the non-residential 
construction requirements outlined in § 157.04.10.B. 
8. ?Map interpretation. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the 
areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a 
mapped boundary and actual field conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person 
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the 
interpretation as provided in this article. 
9. ?Prevailing authority. Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field 
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations for flood protection elevations (as found on an 
elevation profile, floodway data table, etc.) shall prevail. The correct information should be 
submitted to FEMA as per the map maintenance activity requirements outlined in § 
157.04.10.G. 
10. ?Use of best available data. When base flood elevation data and floodway data has not been 
provided in accordance with § 157.01.30, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize best available 
base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, 
including data developed pursuant to the standards for subdivision proposals outlined in § 
157.04.10.L, in order to administer the provisions of this chapter. Data from preliminary, draft, 
and final Flood Insurance Studies constitutes best available data from a Federal, State, or other 
source. Data must be developed using hydraulic models meeting the minimum requirement of 
NFIP approved model. If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, 
Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used. 
11. ?Special flood hazard area/topographic boundaries conflict. When the exact location of 
boundaries of the areas [of] special flood hazards conflict with the current, natural topography 
information at the site; the site information takes precedence when the lowest adjacent grade is 
at or above the BFE, the property owner may apply and be approved for a letter of map 
amendment (LOMA) by FEMA. The local Floodplain Administrator in the permit file will maintain 
a copy of the letter of map amendment issued from FEMA. 
12. ?On-site inspections. Make on-site inspections of projects in accordance with the administrative 
procedures outlined in § 157.03.40. 
13. ?Administrative notices. Serve notices of violations, issue stop-work orders, revoke permits and 
take corrective actions in accordance with the administrative procedures in § 157.03.40. 
14. ?Records maintenance. Maintain all records pertaining to the administration of this chapter and 
make these records available for public inspection. 
15. ?Annexations and detachments. Notify the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources 
Land, Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator for the National Flood Insurance 
Program within six (6) months, of any annexations or detachments that include special flood 
hazard areas. 
16. ?Federally funded development. The President issued Executive Order 11988, Floodplain 
Management May 1977. E.O. 11988 directs Federal agencies to assert a leadership role in 
reducing flood losses and losses to environmental values served by floodplains. Proposed 
developments must go through an eight-step review process. Evidence of compliance with the 
executive order must be submitted as part of the permit review process. 
17. ?Substantial damage determination. Perform an assessment of damage from any origin to the 
structure using FEMA's Residential Substantial Damage Estimator (RSDE) software to 
determine if the damage equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the 
structure before the damage occurred. 
18. ?Substantial improvement determinations. Perform an assessment of permit applications for 
improvements or repairs to be made to a building or structure that equals or exceeds fifty 
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the start of construction. Cost of work 
counted for determining if and when substantial improvement to a structure occurs shall be 
cumulative for a period of five (5) years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the 
total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, 
shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur. 
The market values shall be determined by one of the following methods: 
a) ?The current assessed building value as determined by the County's Assessor's Office or 
the value of an appraisal performed by a licensed appraiser at the expense of the owner 
within the past six (6) months. 
b) ?One or more certified appraisals from a registered professional licensed appraiser in 
accordance with the laws of South Carolina. The appraisal shall indicate actual 
replacement value of the building or structure in its pre-improvement condition, less the 
cost of site improvements and depreciation for functionality and obsolescence. 
c) ?Real estate purchase contract within six (6) months prior to the date of the application for a 
permit. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.03.40 - ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. 
1. ?Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit progresses, the local Floodplain 
Administrator shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the 
work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In 
exercising this power, the Floodplain Administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper 
credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the 
purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
2. ?Stop-work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, 
or repaired in violation of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator may order the work to be 
immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the 
work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the 
stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order 
constitutes a misdemeanor. 
3. ?Revocation of permits. The local Floodplain Administrator may revoke and require the return of the 
development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. 
Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or 
specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false 
statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in 
violation of an applicable State or local law may also be revoked. 
4. ?Periodic inspections. The local Floodplain Administrator and each member of his/her inspections 
department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises 
within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of 
inspection or other enforcement action. 
5. ?Violations to be corrected. When the local Floodplain Administrator finds violations of applicable 
State and local laws, it shall be his/her duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the 
violation. The owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the 
property he owns. 
6. ?Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a building or property shall fail to 
take prompt corrective action, the Floodplain Administrator shall give him written notice, by certified 
or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, that: 
a) ?The building or property is in violation of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, 
b) ?A hearing will be held before the local Floodplain Administrator at a designated place and time, 
not later than ten (10) days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled 
to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the 
matter; and, 
c) ?Following the hearing, the local Floodplain Administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate, 
or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears appropriate. 
7. ?Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the 
Floodplain Administrator shall find that the building or development is in violation of the Flood 
Damage Prevention Ordinance, he/she shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the 
owner to remedy the violation within such period, not less than sixty (60) days, the Floodplain 
Administrator may prescribe; provided that where the Floodplain Administrator finds that there is 
imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser 
period as may be feasible. 
8. ?Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order to 
the local elected governing body by giving notice of appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator 
and the Clerk within ten (10) days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, 
the order of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear an 
appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
9. ?Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property fails to comply with an order to 
take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the 
governing body following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in 
the discretion of the court. 
10. ?Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared in violation of this chapter and 
after all other penalties are exhausted to achieve compliance with this chapter then the local 
Floodplain Administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate 
a Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the 
finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with the chapter. Once a 
violation has been remedied the local Floodplain Administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and 
ask that the Section 1316 be rescinded. 
11. ?[Documents are incorporated by reference]. The following documents are incorporated by reference 
and may be used by the local Floodplain Administrator to provide further guidance and interpretation

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 


§ 157.04.00 - GENERAL STANDARDS. 
    Development may not occur in the special flood hazard area (SFHA) where alternative locations 
exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall 
demonstrate that new structures cannot be located out of the SFHA and that encroachments onto the 
SFHA are minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
A. ?Reasonably Safe From Flooding - Review all permit applications to determine whether 
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
B. ?Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent 
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure. 
C. ?Flood resistant materials and equipment. All new construction and substantial improvements 
shall be constructed with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood 
damage in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials 
Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
D. ?Minimize flood damage. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be 
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages. 
E. ?Critical development. Shall be elevated to the 500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the 
highest known historical flood elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If 
no data exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known historical flood 
elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that 
generates 500-year flood elevation data. 
F. ?Utilities. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including 
ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water 
from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood plus 
two feet (2') of freeboard. 
G. ?Water supply systems. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to 
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
H. ?Sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to 
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the 
systems into floodwaters. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to 
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
I. ?Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or 
buried, shall be anchored to prevent floatation and lateral movement resulting from 
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads. 
J. ?Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or 
improvement to a structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet 
the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM 
development and structures. 
K. ?Non-conforming buildings or uses. Non-conforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, 
replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance 
with the provisions of this chapter. Provided, however, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the 
repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or 
partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood 
elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or 
replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter. 
L. ?American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain 
construction outlined in § 157.04.10, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is 
not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of 
improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the 
improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.04.10 - SPECIFIC STANDARDS. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard ( Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE) where base flood 
elevation data has been provided, as set forth in § 157.01.30 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities 
of the local Floodplain Administrator § 157.03.30, the following provisions are required: 
A. ?Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential 
structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than two 
feet (2') above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation 
perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically 
equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings 
requirements in § 157.04.10.D. 
B. ?Non-residential construction. 
a) ?New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-
residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated 
no lower than two feet (2') above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid 
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to 
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the 
elevated buildings requirements in § 157.04.10.D. No basements are permitted. Structures 
located in A-Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the 
structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable 
to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting 
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. 
b) ?A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this 
subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in 
the floodproofing certification requirements in § 157.03.20. A variance may be considered 
for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in § 
157.05.40 of this chapter. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of § 157.05.40 
must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of 
this chapter. Structures that are floodproofed are required to have an approved 
maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The local Floodplain Administrator must 
approve the maintenance plan and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to 
it. 
C. ?Manufactured homes. 
a) ?Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a 
manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, 
in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing 
manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred 
"substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation 
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet (2') 
above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored 
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b) ?Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing 
manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions for residential 
construction in § 157.04.10.A of this chapter must be elevated so that the lowest floor of 
the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet (2') above the base flood 
elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist 
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c) ?Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral 
movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to 
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement in accordance with Section 40-29-10 of the 
South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when 
the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis thirty-six inches 
(36") or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers 
or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six inches (36") 
in height an engineering certification is required. 
d) ?An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, 
substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions 
located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local 
Floodplain Administrator and the local Emergency Preparedness Coordinator. 
D. ?Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings that 
include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for the parking of 
vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and which are 
subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to 
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and 
exit of floodwaters. 
a) ?Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional 
engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the following minimum criteria: 
(1) ?Provide a minimum of two (2) openings on different walls having a total net area of 
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to 
flooding. 
(2) ?The bottom of each opening must be no more than one foot above the higher of the 
interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening. 
(3) ?Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be 
counted towards the required net open area. 
(4) ?Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or 
devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
(5) ?Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the 
enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at 
least one side of the building. 
b) ?Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any 
foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood 
velocities are excessive (greater than five feet (5') per second), foundation systems other 
than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood 
flows are minimized. 
c) ?Enclosures below lowest floor. 
(1) ?Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of 
vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in 
connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area 
(stairway or elevator). 
(2) ?The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into 
separate rooms, must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required for 
safety, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
(3) ?One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker 
may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific 
standards outlined in § 157.04.10.A, B, and C. 
(4) ?All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the 
specific standards outlined in § 157.04.10.A, B, C and D should be of flood resistant 
materials. 
E. ?Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 157.01.30, are areas 
designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of 
floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following 
provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a) ?No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, 
and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
(1) ?It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in 
accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment 
would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base 
flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local Floodplain 
Administrator. 
(2) ?A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter 
of map revision must be obtained upon completion of the proposed development. 
b) ?If § 157.04.10.E is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall 
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of § 157.04. 
c) ?No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park 
or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing 
manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and the elevation 
standards of § 157.04.10.C and the encroachment standards of § 157.04.10.E are met. 
d) ?Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant 
nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar 
agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, 
and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not 
employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-
impact certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the 
extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the 
floodway configuration. 
F. ?Recreational vehicles. 
a) ?A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is: 
(1) ?On wheels or jacking system; 
(2) ?Attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices; and 
(3) ?Has no permanently attached additions. 
b) ?Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be: 
(1) ?On site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; or 
(2) ?Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the development permit and 
certification requirements of § 157.03.20, general standards outlined in § 157.04.00, 
and manufactured homes standards in § 157.04.10.C and D. 
G. ?Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires flood data 
to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures that flood maps, studies and other data 
identified in § 157.01.30 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain 
management criteria are based on current data. The following map maintenance activities are 
identified: 
a) ?Requirement to submit new technical data. 
(1) ?For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood 
elevations, the community shall ensure that technical or scientific data reflecting such 
changes be submitted to FEMA as soon as practicable, but no later than six (6) 
months of the date such information becomes available. These development 
proposals include; but not limited to: 
(a) ?Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood elevations or 
alter floodway boundaries; 
(b) ?Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where the 
applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area; 
(c) ?Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special 
flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and 
(d) ?Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of

one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no 
floodway. 
(4) ?Floodplain development permits issued by the local Floodplain Administrator shall be 
conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map revision from FEMA for any 
development proposal subject to § 157.04.10.G. 
b) ?Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator may request changes to 
any of the information shown on an effective map that does not impact floodplain or 
floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. 
Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by 
the local jurisdiction and may be submitted at any time. 
H. ?Accessory structures. 
a) ?A detached accessory structure or garage, the cost of which is greater than three thousand

    Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any taxpayer may appeal such 
decision to the Court. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.05.20 - HISTORIC STRUCTURES. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination 
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a 
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and 
design of the structure. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.05.30 - FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USES. 
    Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent 
use, provided the criteria of this chapter are met, no reasonable alternative exist, and the development is 
protected by methods that minimize flood damage and create no additional threat to public safety. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.05.40 - AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURES. 
    Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure provided it is used solely for 
agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages during the base flood and the threat to public 
health and safety, the structure must meet all of the conditions and considerations of § 157.05.70, this 
section, and the following standards: 
1. ?Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed below: 
a) ?Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for the storage of farm 
machinery and equipment, 
b) ?Steel grain bins and steel frame corncribs, 
c) ?General-purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock that are open on at least one 
side; 
d) ?For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy operations, and similar livestock 
operations, variances may not be issued for structures that were substantially damaged. 
New construction or substantial improvement of such structures must meet the elevation 
requirements of § 157.04.10.B of this chapter; and, 
2. ?The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an existing building that is 
substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials for the exterior and interior building 
components and elements below the base flood elevation. 
3. ?The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral 
movement. All of the structure's components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related 
forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood 
velocities exceed five feet (5') per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable 
pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls. 
4. ?The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of § 157.04.10.D of this chapter. 
5. ?Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood 
elevation (BFE), plus any required freeboard, or be contained within a watertight, floodproofed 
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with § 
157.04.00 of this chapter. 
6. ?The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of § 
157.04.10.E of this chapter. 
7. ?Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include 
protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for 
readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the 
base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without 
risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.05.50 - CONSIDERATIONS. 
    In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all 
relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
1. ?The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2. ?The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to 
the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
3. ?The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such 
damage on the individual owner; 
4. ?The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5. ?The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6. ?The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the 
proposed use; 
7. ?The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the 
relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management 
program for that area; 
8. ?The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters 
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
9. ?The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including 
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water 
systems, and streets and bridges; and 
10. ?Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other 
alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the 
entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be 
located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the 
structure are available.

§ 157.05.60 - FINDINGS. 
    Findings listed above shall be submitted to the Appeal Board, in writing, and included in the 
application for a variance. Additionally, comments from the Department of Natural Resources, Land, 
Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator's Office, must be taken into account and included in 
the permit file. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.05.70 - FLOODWAYS. 
    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during 
the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In 
order to ensure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the variance is granted the 
applicant must provide a bond for one hundred percent (100%) of the cost to perform the development. 
(Ord. 2018-19 , § 1(Att.), passed 6-11-18) 


§ 157.05.80 - CONDITIONS. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board 
may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of 
this chapter. The following conditions shall apply to all variances: 
1. ?Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other 
Federal, State, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
2. ?Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum 
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
3. ?Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination 
that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that 
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public 
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the 
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
4. ?Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the 
difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to 
be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the 
increased risk. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
5. ?The local Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report 
any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request. 
6. ?Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in 
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Violations must be corrected in accordance with 
§ 157.03.40 of this chapter.

commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter. 
    "100-year flood" means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in 
any given year. 
    "Primary drainage channel" means a drainage channel, stream or creek which drains an area of 
three hundred (300) acres or more. 
    "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land 
areas that must be traversed in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the 
water surface elevation more than one foot (1'), as identified on an official Flood Insurance Rate Map or 
other available information. 
    "Secondary drainage channel" means a drainage channel, stream or creek which drains an area of 
less than three hundred (300) acres. 
    "Structure" means anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires a location on the 
ground, or attached to something having a location on the ground, including, but not limited to buildings, 
mobile homes, gas or liquid storage tanks, fences, tennis courts and swimming pools. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost 
of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure prior to improvement. 
    "Ten-year flood" means the flood having ten percent (10%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in 
any given year. 
    "25-year flood" means the flood having a four percent (4%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in 
any given year.

    The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to: 
(A) ?Agricultural land management and cultural practices, or to the construction of on-farm 
nonresidential buildings and structures used in a farming operation; provided, that such 
practices of structures shall not impede the flood-carrying capacity of a regulatory floodway. 
(B) ?Construction and land improvement of a single-family residence or its accessory building(s) 
which is not a part of a residential subdivision; provided, that such construction or land 
improvement does not materially impede the runoff capacity of the existing major drainage 
channels or is not located in an area of special flood hazard. In a developed residential 
subdivision, a single-family residence property owner may make land improvements on his 
single lot without an approved storm drainage plan; provided, that such construction or land 
improvement does not impede the runoff capability of the existing major drainage channels or is 
not located in an area of special flood hazard. 
(C) ?Mining and mineral resource extraction operations conducted in accordance with a valid 
mining permit issued by the Mining and Reclamation Division of South Carolina Land 
Resources Commission; provided, that such operations shall not impede the flood-carrying 
capacity of a regulatory floodway. 
(D) ?Construction or land improvement by a State or Federal agency conducted in accordance with 
a State or Federal land management program; provided, that such improvements shall not 
impede the flood carrying capacity of a regulatory floodway. 
(E) ?Construction or land improvement on tracts two (2) acres or less which may be exempted by 
the Town Engineer upon a showing by the owner or applicant that no special drainage 
structures are required because of the particular topographical characteristics of the tracts. 
(Ord. 82, § 3-2, passed 4-17-89) 


§ 158.03.03 - APPLICATION FOR PLAN APPROVAL. 
    The applicant shall submit six (6) copies of a storm drainage plan prepared in accordance with §§ 
158.04.01 through 158.05.01 to the Town Administrator. The storm drain age plan shall include such 
stream flow and storm runoff calculations and other information as may be reasonably required by the 
Town Engineer under the terms of this chapter, and shall be certified by the applicant, and a South 
Carolina registered professional engineer or registered landscape architect in accordance with the

(6) ?Appropriate inlet control and outlet control curves shall be used to determine headwater depths 
where applicable. 
(7) ?Interval drainage systems and easements shall be designed to handle the 25-year storm for 
watersheds three hundred (300) acres or less, and 50-year storm for larger watersheds. The 
roadway drainage systems shall be designed for a ten-year storm. Any and all off-site runoff 
should be accommodated. Off-site runoff onto or through the proposed development shall be 
based on ultimate development of off-site watersheds. Major drainage channels as defined by 
the Town shall be designed for a 200-year storm, regardless of whether on-site or off-site. 
(8) ?In areas of known drainage problems, no future land changes which will impact peak rate, 
timing, and volume will be allowed until it is established that no adverse on-site or off-site 
impacts will result. 
(Ord. 82, § 4-1, passed 4-17-89) 


§ 158.04.02 - PRIMARY DRAINAGE CHANNEL REQUIREMENTS. 
    All primary drainage channels which are located within or immediately adjacent to an improvement, 
development or subdivision shall be protected and/or improved by the applicant as follows: 
(A) ?Responsibility of applicant. 
(1) ?The applicant shall be responsible for carrying out the proposed work in accordance with 
the approved storm drainage plan, and in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(2) ?The applicant shall plan and carry out his developments in a manner that will not interfere 
with or restrict the flow of water nor increase the base flood level by more than one foot (1') 
for drainage channels within or immediately adjacent to his property which drain an area of 
three hundred (300) acres or larger. The developer shall be responsible for any 
improvements to such channels needed to handle increased runoff or other changes 
resulting from his development, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(B) ?All land adjacent to a primary drainage channel not protected by levees, dikes or fill shall be 
dedicated for the purpose of providing a drainage right-of-way as follows: 
(1) ?In a commercial or residential subdivision, drainage easements of at least twenty-foot 
width shall be deeded to the Town and shall be separate and apart from adjoining lots. 
Easements must provide for access of construction and maintenance equipment and 
crews. Large easements may be required if the width of the drainage channel so dictates. 
(2) ?In group developments and/or planned unit developments, the property owner(s) or 
homeowners association shall be responsible for maintenance of drainage channels and 
easements. The final plat approved to be recorded shall indicate and label public 
easements for drainage channels. The Town shall have the right to encroach onto these 
public easements or permit others to encroach for any purpose deemed appropriate by the 
Town Engineer. In no way does this right of encroachment lessen the obligation of the 
property owner(s) or homeowner's association's responsibility for maintenance of drainage 
channels and easements. 
(C) ?The existing channel lying within or contiguous to the subdivision or parcel of land proposed for 
development or redevelopment shall be cleaned to provide for free flow of water, and the 
channel shall be straightened, widened, and improved to the extent required to prevent 
overflow, resulting from a 50-year frequency rainfall, beyond the limits of the dedicated drainage 
easement provided for in § 158.04.02(A). 
(D) ?Final grading of all lots or building sites for new construction or substantial improvement of 
residential structures in areas of special flood hazard shall provide for elevation on fill piling or 
earth-filled curtain walls of the lowest habitable floor to at least one foot (1') above the 100-year 
flood level. Where fill is used to meet this requirement the area one foot (1') above the 100-year 
flood level shall extend at least ten feet (10') from each side of the building pad. Certain types of 
nonresidential structures are permitted within the floodplain if properly "floodproofed" in 
compliance with the flood control ordinance and building codes. 
(E) ?Whenever channel improvements are carried out, sodding, backsloping, cribbing, and other 
bank protection shall be designated and constructed to control erosion for the anticipated 
conditions and flow resulting from a 50-year frequency rainfall. 
(F) ?Drainage channels located within street easements shall be placed in an enclosed storm 
sewer. 
(G) ?All levees protecting residential structures or nonresidential structures which are not 
floodproofed shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to provide protection against the 
500-year flood plus three feet (3') of freeboard. Flood elevations shall be as shown on the latest 
flood insurance rate maps. Other determinations made by appropriate hydrologic methods will 
be acceptable where flood insurance rate maps are not available. 
(H) ?No levees, dikes, fill materials, structures or obstructions that will impede the free flow of water 
during the times of flood will be permitted in the regulatory floodway. 
(Ord. 82, § 4-2, passed 4-17-89) 


§ 158.04.03 - SECONDARY DRAINAGE CHANNEL AND SURFACE REQUIREMENTS. 
    All secondary drainage channels which are within or immediately adjacent to an improvement, 
development or subdivision shall be protected and improved by the applicant as follows: 
(A) ?Drainage easements of at least seventy-foot width and access for construction and 
maintenance equipment and crews shall be dedicated to the Town for all drainage 
improvements in subdivision developments. Drainage improvements for group developments, 
commercial buildings, or planned unit developments shall be the maintenance responsibility of 
the property owner(s) or homeowner's association. 
(B) ?Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of collecting surface water from 
adjacent properties or intercepting and diverting side hill drainage shall be improved open 
channels. 
(C) ?Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of transporting stormwater 
through a block or development or of collecting water from cross channels shall be improved as 
follows: 
(1) ?Those channels having drainage basins of forty (40) acres or more shall be improved with 
either a closed storm sewer or improved open channel designed to carry the runoff 
resulting from a 25-year frequency rainfall. A natural stream may be retained for use as an 
open drainage channel for landscaping, architectural or aesthetic purposes in residential 
subdivision or group developments where maintenance will be the responsibility of the 
property owner(s) or homeowner's association provided that it has the capacity to carry the 
runoff resulting from a 25-year frequency rainfall and flood protection requirements are 
met. 
(2) ?Those drainage channels having drainage basins of less than forty (40) acres shall be 
improved with closed storm sewers. Variations from the requirement may be permitted, 
however, under the following conditions: 
(a) ?When the required storm sewer pipe size is calculated to exceed thirty inches (30"), 
the Town Engineer may authorize the substitution of a concrete lined open channel. 
(b) ?A natural stream or improved open channel may be approved by the Town Engineer 
for landscaping, architectural, or aesthetic purposes in residential subdivisions and 
group developments where maintenance will be the responsibility of the property 
owner(s) or homeowner's association, provided it has the capacity to carry the runoff 
resulting from a ten-year frequency rainfall and flood protection requirements are met. 
(D) ?Final grading of all lots or building sites for new construction or substantial improvements of 
residential structures in areas of special flood hazard shall provide for elevation on fill pilings or 
earth-filled curtain walls of the lowest habitable floor to at least one foot (1') above the 100-year 
flood level. Where fill is used to meet this requirement the area one foot (1') above the 100-year 
flood level shall extend at least ten feet (10') from each side of the building pad. Certain type 
structures are permitted within the floodplain if properly "floodproofed" in conformance with the 
Zoning Ordinance and Building Code. 
(E) ?Drainage channels located within the street easements shall be placed in an enclosed storm 
sewer. 
(F) ?Off-site discharge of closed storm sewers or improved open channels will be permitted only at 
natural streams or man-made drainage channels acceptable to the Town Engineer unless a 
drainage easement is obtained from the adjoining land owner. When off-site drainage channels 
are not adequate to accept the additional runoff resulting from the development, the Town 
Engineer shall have the authority to require the developer to install on-site facilities for the 
detention/ storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff designed to limit the discharge to 
predevelopment levels. 
(G) ?Developments. 
(1) ?Single-family residential, duplex or mobile home development: 
(a) ?Site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that surface water from each 
dwelling will flow directly to a storm sewer, improved channel, sodded swale, or paved 
street without running more than two hundred feet (200'). 
(2) ?Commercial, industrial, multifamily and institutional development: 
(a) ?Roofs, paved areas, yards, courts, courtyards and other impervious surfaces shall be 
drained into a storm sewer system. Exception: Such drainage may flow directly into a 
street, curb and gutter system or improved channel when of small area and approved 
by the Town Engineer. Construction of buildings over storm drainage improvements 
will not be permitted. 
(H) ?Surface water collected on streets shall be diverted to enclosed storm sewers or other 
drainage channels at satisfactory intervals to prevent overflow of the street and its curbs and 
gutters, where provided, during a ten-year frequency rainfall. 
(Ord. 82, § 4-3, passed 4-17-89) 


§ 158.04.04 - DESIGN CRITERIA FOR IMPROVEMENTS. 
(A) ?Open channels. Open channels shall be provided with an improved section that will carry the runoff 
from the appropriate design rainfall and preclude the creation of backwater inundating any areas 
outside of dedicated drainage easements. The channel shall be designed and protected against 
erosion in accordance with the South Carolina Sediment and Erosion Control Practices Manual. 
(B) ?Closed storm sewers and culverts. Closed storm sewers and culverts shall be constructed of 
precast or prefabricated pipe or box culvert or built in place, or closed box design, in conformance 
with Town specifications. They shall be sized to carry the runoff from the appropriate design rainfall 
and to preclude the backup of headwater inundating any areas outside of dedicated drainage 
easements. 
(C) ?Bridges. Bridges shall be designed to span the full width of the channel or regulatory floodway as 
determined under the provisions of this chapter. The design shall be in accordance with standards 
adopted by the Town Engineer. Construction shall be in accordance with South Carolina Department 
of Highways and Public Transportation Specifications. 
(D) ?Levees. Levees shall be designated and constructed and maintained as follows: 
(1) ?Design and construction shall be in accordance with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Manual 
EM 1110-2-1913 (31 March 1978) "Design and Construction of Levees." The design and 
construction of drainage systems within levees shall be in accordance with the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers Manual EM 1110-2-1410 (May 3, 1965) "Interior Drainage of Leveed Urban 
Areas." A South Carolina registered professional engineer shall certify that he has been 
involved in the design, construction, and inspection phases and has certified that the 
construction meets the requirements of the Corps of Engineers. 
(2) ?Owners of levy will perform necessary required maintenance of levees and provide appropriate 
records to the Town Administrator. These records will include: 
(a) ?A signed agreement of perpetual operation and maintenance by the owner; 
(b) ?As-built construction plans certified by a South Carolina registered professional engineer; 
(c) ?Levee maintenance program in accordance with the Levee Maintenance Standards and 
Procedures of the Town of Lexington (see Appendix 1); and 
(d) ?Periodic maintenance reports as required by the Town Engineer. 
(E) ?Stormwater detention facilities. Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to restrict the peak 
runoff rate from a development during its design rainfall to the peak runoff rate that existed prior to 
development during the same rainfall. The design rainfall shall be ten (10), twenty-five (25) or fifty 
(50) years depending on the size of the drainage basin. Overflow structures and emergency 
spillways, however, shall be designed to accommodate a 100-year rainfall. 
(Ord. 82, § 4-4, passed 4-17-89)

APPENDIX 1 - LEVEE MAINTENANCE STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES 
1. ?Purpose and Scope. This regulation establishes standards and procedures for levee maintenance 
throughout the Town of Lexington. The term "levee" as used herein also includes seepage and 
stability berms. 
2. ?General. Adequate levee maintenance is essential and cannot be overemphasized. Failure to 
maintain levees properly may render the levees inoperative during periods when their protection is 
needed. For safety in times of high water or floods, levee maintenance will be thorough and 
continuous. This requires a balanced maintenance program based on defined standards and 
procedures. 
3. ?Maintenance Standards and Procedures. The levees will be maintained as necessary to insure 
serviceability against floods at all times. 
(a) ?Sod Growth. Maintenance of a sturdy sod growth on levee embankments is highly important as 
sod is one of the most effective means of protecting the levee against erosion from rain, current 
and wave wash. Periodic mowing with tractor operated equipment is essential to maintaining a 
good sod growth, and should be done at such intervals as necessary to keep down weeds and 
other noxious growth and to prevent the grass heights from exceeding twelve inches (12"). The 
grass should be mowed to a height of two inches (2") or more. The number of mowings required 
each season will depend on local conditions. The last mowing of the season will be 
accomplished under conditions which will allow the grass to obtain a height of approximately 
eight inches (8") to ten inches (10") going into the winter season. Mowing will be performed to a 
distance of at least five feet (5') beyond the toe of the levee or berm. Burning grass and weeds 
will not be permitted in the levee maintenance program. 
Spraying with herbicides as needed during the growing season is permissible and desirable for 
weed and brush control on the levee and berms. 
Reseeding and fertilizing is to be at the rate necessary to sustain sod growth and levee 
embankments for control of erosion. 
(b) ?Earth Embankments. Levee embankments will be maintained to not less than the design grade 
and section by replacing any loss of material from the crown or slopes. Ruts, washes, slides, 
and subsidences should be properly repaired and the entire embankment maintained 
sufficiently smooth for power mowing. Levee crowns should be graded as necessary to drain 
freely and prevent impoundment of rain water. 
All brush, trees and other undesirable wild growth will be removed from the levee embankment. 
(c) ?Animal Burrows. Levees and adjacent landward areas will be maintained free from all types of 
animal burrows. Animal burrows, when found, will be backfilled with compacted material and 
sodded. To prevent reoccurrences, efforts will be made to exterminate the burrowing animals. 
(d) ?Prevention of Encroachment. Care will be taken to assure that the levees are not encroached 
upon. Buildings, structures and storage of miscellaneous materials or equipment will not be 
permitted on the levee. Refuse dumps are an item of frequent concern and will not be permitted. 
Following each high water, any dirt or debris which has been deposited on the riverside slope of 
the levee will be removed promptly. 
(e) ?Roads and Ramps. Access roads to and on levees, including ramps will be bladed as 
necessary to keep the roadway shaped properly and free of ruts, pockets and washes. Ramp 
embankments should be maintained to their design section and design grade. Maintenance as 
necessary will be performed to correct any encroachment into the levee crown where roads 
cross levees. Road surfacing material will be replaced as necessary to maintain the road 
surface in good condition. 
(f) ?Miscellaneous Levee Facilities and Appurtenances. Miscellaneous levee facilities and 
appurtenances which are constructed on, over or through the levee will be maintained in a good 
state of repair and/or in good operating condition. The condition of these facilities will be 
inspected at least annually and those items which are operative only during high river stages 
will be checked carefully and repaired as necessary immediately prior to the high water season. 
Relief walls should be checked during periods of high water. Wells which do not flow for an 
extended period of time may have to be tested by pumping to determine the extent of 
deterioration. Where wells are found to be critically deteriorated, they will be rehabilitated by 
cleaning, surging, and pumping. Check valves will be inspected to insure that they open freely 
and that gaskets are in good condition. The most common of these facilities and appurtenances 
referred to herein are: 
1. ?Drainage structures through the levee; 
2. ?Toe drainage systems; 
3. ?Relief walls; 
4. ?Levee slope protection and protection on dike ends; 
5. ?Gates, cattle guards, and fences; 
6. ?Siphons and pipe crossings. 
4. ?Inspection. Frequent inspections are essential to a good levee maintenance program. Inspections 
will be made by the levee owner or his representative prior to the beginning of the flood season, 
during and immediately following each high water period, and at such intermediate times as 
necessary to insure satisfactory care of the levee.

CHAPTER 160 - ARCHITECTURAL AND APPEARANCE STANDARDS 
Section 


GENERAL PROVISIONS 


§ 160.01.01 - PURPOSE. 
    In order to preserve and enhance the rural, cultural, economic and historic character of the Town of 
Lexington, by providing detailed review of the design, layout, visual appearance, aesthetic character and 
economic value of commercial and industrial developments that have a substantial impact upon the 
character of the Town and upon traffic, utilities and services therein. And because excessive uniformity, 
dissimilarity, inappropriateness, or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance of structures and 
signs, and the lack of proper attention to site design in the major commercial corridors of the town hinders 
the harmonious development of the town, impairs the desirability of residence, investment or occupation 
in the town, limits the opportunity to attain the optimum use and value of land and improvements, 
adversely affects the stability and value of property, produces degeneration of property in such areas with 
attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the peace, health and welfare of the town, and destroys a 
proper relationship between the taxable value of property and the cost of municipal services. 
    The intent of the review process is to: 
(1) ?Encourage originality, flexibility, and innovation in site planning and development, including the 
architecture, landscaping, and graphic design of said development; 
(2) ?Discourage monotonous, drab, unsightly, dreary and inharmonious developments; 
(3) ?Protect and enhance the appearance of development; 
(4) ?Protect and enhance the Town's natural beauty, visual character and charm by ensuring that 
structures, signs, and other improvements are properly related to their sites, and to surrounding 
sites and structures, and that proper attention is given to the exterior appearance of structures, 
signs, and other improvements; 
(5) ?Protect and enhance the Town's appeal to residents and visitors and thus support and 
stimulate business and industry and promote the desirability of investment and occupancy in 
residential, commercial and industrial properties; 
(6) ?Stabilize and improve property values and prevent blighted areas and, thus, increase tax 
revenues; 
(7) ?Implement design guidelines that have been included in plans adopted by the Town Council; 
(8) ?Sustain the comfort, health, tranquility, and contentment of residents, the and thus promote and 
protect the peace, health and welfare of the Town; 
(9) ?Promote conservation of buildings and groups of buildings that have aesthetic or historic 
significance; and 
(10) ?Enhance historical, social and economic viability of the Town by preserving property values 
and promoting visual attractiveness. 
    Please note that the purpose of the Architectural and Appearance Design Manual is not to 
encourage commercial development in residential areas but to encourage aesthetically pleasing 
commercial development anywhere it might be. The Town of Lexington's Zoning Ordinance governs the 
use of land and the location of commercial development.
