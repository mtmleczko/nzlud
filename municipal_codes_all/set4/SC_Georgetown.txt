PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of the City of Georgetown, of a general and permanent nature, and is the first codification since 1964. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. 
    A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code volume is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables also appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixteenth section of Chapter 5 is 5-16. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 7-2 and 7-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 7-2.1, 7-2.2 and 7-2.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

The new provisions may then be set out in full as desired.

(a)  By contract, or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code.

For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Sec. 1-16. - General penalty.

Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any such ordinance or resolution shall continue shall constitute a separate offense, except as otherwise may be provided. In addition to the penalty hereinabove provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or of any such ordinance or resolution shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the city as provided by law. 
(b)  Orders, rules and regulations. Any person who shall violate, or fail, neglect or refuse to comply with any lawful order of any lawful officer of the city made in pursuance of and under such officer's authority, or who shall violate, or shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with any of the rules and regulations or laws adopted by this Code, shall be guilty of an offense; provided, however, the provisions of this section shall not apply to violations of official duty imposed by this Code upon officers or employees of the city as such, unless the provision imposing the duty also expressly makes the violation thereof unlawful or punishable.

(Ord. of 9-18-03(2)) 
State Law reference- Executive sessions, S.C. Code 1976, § 30-4-70. 
Sec. 2-28. - Quorum and rules of order. 
(a)  Quorum. A majority of council members serving constitutes a quorum for the conduct of business at any meeting. The mayor of mayor pro tempore shall preside, except that in the absence of both, the members present shall elect a presiding member. (Ref. §§ 30-4-20(e), 5-7-190 S.C. Code of Laws.) 
(b)  Order. 
(1)  Debate. Debate is the discussion on the merits of a pending question to determine if the issue should be adopted or not. Debate shall be managed by the mayor in an impartial manner. The term "mayor" used in this section is inclusive of the mayor pro tempore or other elected presiding officer while serving as presiding officer in a meeting. Council members can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chair. Debate can be interrupted (i.e. a member may interrupt another member who has the floor), only to make a motion to adjourn, a motion to raise a point of privilege, or to raise a point of order the council member making a motion is entitled to speak first; members who have not spoken on the issue shall be recognized ahead of those who have previously spoken. 
(2)  Main motions. In order for city council to take official action on any subject, a member must first propose a main motion on a matter on the agenda, as published or amended. A motion to amend the agenda is a main motion. Proposed main motion will not be recognized by the mayor until another council member seconds the motion. A second does not require the council member seconding the motion to support the motion. A council member may withdraw a main motion he or she made at any time before council has voted on that motion. (Ref. section 2-31(c); § 30-4-80(a), S.C. Code of Laws.) 
(3)  Procedural motions. During the course of debate, council members may introduce procedural motions, which are limited to those specific motions described in subsections a.-c., below. Procedural motions are used to facilitate the orderly discussion of business. Privileged motions and points of order do not require a second. 
a.  Privileged motions (not requiring a second). Privileged motions are the highest ranking group of procedural motions, ranked in precedence subsections 1.-3., below. Privileged motions can be made anytime; the motion to adjourn can interrupt another member who has the floor. When making this motion, the member should get the attention of the mayor. The mayor, interrupting anyone then speaking, recognizes the council member, who then states the motion. 
Privileged motions require no second, cannot be reconsidered and, except for the motion to take a recess, are not debatable. 
1.  Motion to adjourn. A motion to adjourn is the highest ranking privileged motion and requires, if approved by a majority vote, that the meeting end immediately and reconvene at the next regularly scheduled or called meeting. It can be raised anytime, except when a vote is being taken or being counted. It can be interrupted only by the motion to reconsider. It cannot be amended, debated or reconsidered. 
2.  Motion to take a recess. A recess is a short intermission, taken immediately upon passage. Following the recess, the meeting takes up at the same point where it was interrupted. The motion cannot be debated or reconsidered, but can be amended as to the duration of the recess. This motion is out of order if anyone has the floor or a vote is being taken or counted. 
3.  Motion to follow the agenda. This motion is used to get a meeting back on schedule and is appropriate when the meeting has been allowed to digress or when a specific time scheduled for an item of business has arrived and the chair has failed to take notice. Once the motion is made, the chair must conform with the agenda or put the motion to a vote. The motion cannot be amended, debated or reconsidered. 
b.  Subsidiary motions. The six subsidiary motions help deliberative bodies reach a decision on other pending motions. Subsidiary motions are always applied to another pending motion. Three subsidiary motions - motion to amend, motion to limit/extend debate and motion to call for the question - can be applied to other subsidiary motions. All subsidiary motions are out of order when another person has the floor. 
1.  Motion to table. A motion to table proposes that the consideration of a motion be postponed until a later time. It is an appropriate motion to take up another matter, out of order, and to return later to the tabled motion. The main motion can be brought back for consideration if a motion to recall is later passed by city council. A motion that has been laid on the table will die if it has not been taken from the table by the close of the meeting following the meeting in which the motion was tabled. Amendments and debate are not allowed on a motion to table and it cannot be reconsidered. 
2.  Motion to call for the question. If passed, this motion cuts off debate and forces an immediate vote on the pending issue. The Motion to Call for the Question is neither debatable nor amendable, but can be reconsidered up until a vote is taken on the called question. The mayor can call for the question at any break in debate. This is not a motion. 
3.  Motion to limit/extend debate. The motion to limit debate and the motion to extend debate regard length of debate minimizing or expanding. The details of such motions are to be provided by the member making the motion. Either motion can be applied to any motion that is debatable. Debate is not allowed on either motion, nor can either be reconsidered. The motions can be amended as to the length of the time limitation. 
4.  Motion to postpone. A motion to postpone is appropriate when a council member believes that the pending main motion should not be considered until some point in the future. This motion is in order even though debate has already occurred on the main motion. The motion to postpone may either be indefinite or for a time certain, setting a particular time for the main motion to be considered again, which may be later in the same meeting, at a future meeting or upon the occurrence of a specified event or the issuance of a necessary report. The motion is debatable, amendable as to the duration of postponement and can be reconsidered. If the motion is set for a time certain, the city clerk will assist the mayor in bringing the motion back to city council for further consideration at the specified time. 
5.  Motion to refer to committee. The mayor may refer any matter to a committee. If the mayor does not refer a matter to a committee and a council member believes further information or study is needed, he or she may move it be referred to a committee or to staff for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, a special committee can be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer to committee may specify the date the committee or staff will report back. If a special committee is formed, the mayor will appoint its members and chair. This motion is debatable and can be amended as to where the motion is to be committed and the date and time for report back. 
6.  Motion to amend. A motion to amend is used to make a change to a pending motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion. A motion to amend can itself be amended, but the motion to amend an amendment cannot. These rules are to be enforced by the mayor. If the amendment is adopted, city council will then consider the amended version of the motion. 
c.  Incidental motions. Incidental motions allow council members to appeal rulings by the mayor, raise points of order, question precedence of motions and raise objections to consideration of matters that are incidental to the discussions at hand but do not directly relate to the main question under discussion. Incidental motions are in order only if they pertain to the motion then pending. If the incidental motion is in order, it takes precedence over any other motions that are pending. Except as described below, incidental motions rank below privileged motions and the motion to table. 
1.  Point of order. The point of order takes precedence over any question from which it arose, but yields to any privileged motion and a motion table. The point of order is not debatable (except that the mayor may ask the member raising the point to explain it), is not amendable, and cannot be reconsidered. It does not require a second. The point of order is in order when another person has the floor and can interrupt a person speaking if the point genuinely requires attention at the time it is raised. Normally, the point is ruled on by the mayor and no vote is taken, unless there is an appeal or the mayor is in doubt. 
2.  Appeal. The duties of the mayor include making rulings on questions of parliamentary procedure. An appeal to the city attorney as parliamentarian is available to members of council who believe the ruling was erroneous. The appeal is in order when another has the floor, but must be taken immediately after the ruling and is out of order if other business has intervened. An appeal takes precedence over any pending question at the time the mayor makes the ruling. It yields to all privileged motions. An appeal can be reconsidered. If there is no specific and controlling rule contained in this Code, the council may thereupon make reference to and be guided by the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order. 
3.  Motion to divide the question. The motion to divide the question allows members to require a question dealing with a single subject to be divided into parts and to have each part considered and voted on separately. This motion is not debatable and cannot be reconsidered. It is amendable only with regard to how the question should be divided. This motion is out of order when another has the floor. It takes precedence over the main motion. If applied to an amendment, it takes precedence over the amendment, but it cannot be made to the underlying matter with an amendment pending. 
4.  Motion to consider by section. Motions to consider by paragraph or to consider by section allow council to break down complex proposals into their component parts and consider, debate and amend each paragraph or section separately. This procedure can be applied by the mayor on his or her own initiative or by council following the adoption of a motion by any member. This motion is not debatable and cannot be reconsidered. It is amendable only with regard to how the question should be divided. It is out of order when another has the floor. It takes precedence over the main motion. If applied to an amendment, it takes precedence over the amendment, but cannot be made to the main motion with an amendment pending. 
(4)  Requests and inquiries. From time to time, council members may need additional background information or may wish to provide such information, so council can understand better the issue under discussion. Requests and inquiries provide the vehicle for exchanging this information. Parliamentary inquiries and points of information may interrupt another who has the floor, but only if the matter requires immediate attention. Requests and inquiries are not amendable, debatable or subject to reconsideration. No votes are taken on parliamentary inquiries or points of information; other requests/inquiries require a majority vote for passage, except that reading of papers requires unanimous consent. All share similar characteristics and can be subdivided into the following categories: 
a.  Parliamentary inquiry. 
1.  Such inquiries are always directed to and answered by the mayor and are used to clarify specific parliamentary or organization rules that have bearing on the issue at hand. 
2.  Point of information. This inquiry is addressed through the mayor, for information relevant to the business at hand. 
3.  Reading of papers. No member of council has the right to read or have another person read from any papers or books as part of that member's debate on any matter without unanimous consent of the other members of council. Even so, it is customary to grant leave to members to read short, pertinent printed matter. 
4.  Personal privilege. Examples of other privileges include requesting to address council on a personal or non-business matter or, if there is no motion pending, requesting to make a presentation. 
(5)  Recall motions. Two recall motions allow issues that have been previously disposed of or assigned to a committee to be brought back to city council. 
a.  Motion to reconsider. Any council member who voted on the prevailing side can make a motion to reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows city council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress or at the immediately preceding meeting; provided, however, that second reading to an ordinance may be reconsidered only at the same meeting. If the matter to be reconsidered was the adoption of a resolution that has already been published or acted upon, the motion is out of order. The motion is debatable if the matter to be reconsidered is debatable, but it cannot be amended or reconsidered. If the motion to reconsider passes, the original decision is voided and council will return to debate and vote again on the original motion. Subject to the time restriction above, the motion to reconsider can be made at any time unless another member has the floor, taking precedence over any other motion and yielding to nothing. A motion to reconsider temporarily suspends any action growing out of the motion to be reconsidered. 
b.  Motion to recall from the table or from committee. The motions to recall from the table and to recall from committee allow the city council to consider a question that has been tabled or assigned but not yet reported out of committee. These motions take precedence over nothing and must be made when no other business is pending. The motions are not debatable or amendable. A tabled motion not recalled by the close of the meeting following the meeting in which it was tabled is dead.

(1)  Resolutions. A resolution is an expression of policy concerning some item of business coming within the city council's official cognizance and often deals with matters of special or temporary character. Resolutions may be introduced by motion of any member of council and may be oral or in writing. Resolutions may be adopted on one reading.

(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the city council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten (10) per cent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic cable rate above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The city council will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates, minus ten (10) per cent, will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the city council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following: 
a.  If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the city council shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or 
b.  If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the city council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the city council determines that the initial basic cable rates are submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard, or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the city council may order the rates reduced in accordance with paragraph (g) or (h) above, as applicable. In addition, the city council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city council's decision resolution. 
(3)  State of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates proposed by the cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were objectives made by other parties to the proposed rate, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision and the city council must give the public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
(j)  Appeal. The city council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. of 1-27-94, § 2) 
Sec. 5.5-33. - Review or request for increase in basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the city and notify all subscribers at least thirty (30) days before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of the initial basic cable rates. 
(b)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the city council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the city council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rate increase within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city. 
(2)  If the city council takes no action within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go into effect. 
(c)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the city council is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety (90) days if the city council needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and 
b.  One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap. 
(2)  The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period. 
(3)  If the city council has not made a decision within a ninety- or one hundred fifty-day period, the city council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(d)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the requested rate increase, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(e)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed rate increase may submit the objection in writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city clerk with the objector's name and address. 
(f)  Delayed determination. If the city council is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the city council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the city council shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the city council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showing. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the city council will review the submission pursuant the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The city council's decision concerning the requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted. 
(j)  Refunds. 
(1)  The city council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments with interest if: 
a.  The city council was unable to make a decision within the extended time period as described in paragraph (c) above; 
b.  The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of the extended review period; and 
c.  The city council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the city council disapproves any portion of the rate increase. 
(1)  The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city council's decision resolution. 
(k)  Appeal. The city council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. of 1-27-94, § 3) 
Sec. 5.5-54. - Cable operator information. 
(a)  City may require. 
(1)  In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the city council may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the city council may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting information to the city council may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection shall not be considered. 
(c)  City council action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b) will be acted upon by the city council. The city council will grant the request if the cable operator presents, by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from the public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the city council denies the request, the city council shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the city return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the city council, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(d)  Appeal. If the city denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five (5) working days of the city council's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(Ord. of 1-27-94, § 4) 
Sec. 5.5-35. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceed the GNP-PI. The factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the city at least thirty (30) days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The city shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the city makes no objection within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect. 
(Ord. of 1-27-94, § 5) 
Sec. 5.5-36. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Refunds. The city may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following circumstances: 
(1)  A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or 
(2)  The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city. 
(b)  Fines. If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order, the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day the cable operator fails to comply.

As used in this subsection, the expression "deadly weapon" means a knife with a blade of over two (2) inches, brass knuckles, nunchucks, blackjacks, nightsticks, or any other instrument designed by a manufacturer to inflict physical injury or serve as a weapon and/or any instrument actually used to inflict or threaten to inflict physical injury. Nothing in the subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the safe transport of unloaded rifles or shotguns through the city by juveniles for the purpose of hunting, target shooting or attending organized firearms safety training activities. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person other than a parent or legal guardian to sell, barter, lend or give any minor under the age of eighteen (18) years any firearm, associated ammunition or any deadly weapon without the express consent of the child's parent or legal guardian. 
(c)  Any parent or legal guardian who knowingly furnishes a firearm to a child under the age of eighteen (18) years for possession or use within the city without having first instructed the child in the safe handling of same in accordance with standards published by the National Rifle Association or an equivalent program shall be guilty of an offense. The chief of police or his designee is hereby authorized to organize and conduct a qualified gun safety program and to establish a schedule of fees for participation in same. 
(d)  It is unlawful for any person to openly display or discharge any firearm or deadly weapon upon any street or public way of the city. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the safe transport of unloaded rifles or shotguns through the city for the purpose of hunting, target shooting or attending organized firearms safety training activities. Additionally, nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting individuals from purchasing or maintaining firearms in private homes or businesses for personal protection as otherwise permitted by law. 
(e)  It is unlawful for any person to possess any firearm or deadly weapon upon any school grounds, within any park, playground or public building or public facility within the corporate limits of the city without first having obtained a permit from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division or the express permission of the police department. 
(f)  Any employee of a public body who has actual knowledge of the possession of a firearm or deadly weapon by any other person upon school grounds or within any park, playground, public building or public facility within the corporate limits of the city has an affirmative duty to report same to the police department. Any failure to report such known possession is unlawful. 
(g)  Any person found in violation of any of the prohibitions set out hereinabove shall be punished as set forth in section 1-16 of this Code. For the purposes of this section, each day during which the prohibited conduct occurs or continues shall be deemed as a separate offense. 
(h)  Nothing contained herein shall be read or construed as preventing law enforcement officials from, in proper circumstances, foregoing commencement of proceedings under this section when, in the judgment of those officials, it would be appropriate to institute proceedings under relevant state criminal law. 
(Ord. of 3-17-94, § I) 
Sec. 16-232. - Prohibition against child neglect or endangerment. 
(a)  It is unsafe for a child under the age of eighteen (18) years to be upon the streets or public ways of the city between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. on any ordinary Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday evening or between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. on any legal holiday evening or any Friday or Saturday evening. 
(b)  It is unlawful for any legal guardian or any person having custody of a child under the age of eighteen (18) years to knowingly fail or otherwise neglect to provide proper care or supervision for the child, to encourage, condone or approve the commission of delinquent acts and/or to knowingly allow the child to be endangered or exposed to the potential of abuse or exploitation of others. The presence of a child under the age of eighteen (18) years upon the streets or in any public place within the city limits during hours as set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall constitute reasonable suspicion that a violation of this section has occurred. All law enforcement officers are authorized to extend protective intervention services to any child believed to be at risk or harm as set out herein and conduct such further investigation as may be viewed as appropriate under the circumstances. Such an investigation shall cease if it is ascertained that the presence of the child is due to his traveling to or from work, any bona fide recreational or educational program sponsored by any governmental, civic, religious or community organization, or travel to or from any duly licensed provider or medical, dental or psychiatric or related care. 
(c)  As used herein, the expression "protective intervention services" shall mean the stopping, questioning, non-punitive detention and transport of a child to his or her home for the purpose of determining whether the child has been the victim of unlawful neglect or whether his or her apparent delinquency has been encouraged, condoned or approved by his or her parent or legal guardian. 
(d)  Any parent or guardian found to be in violation of the neglect provisions of this section shall be punished as set out in section 1-16 of this Code. 
(e)  Any parent or legal guardian whose child receives protective intervention service may be assessed a special user fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) on the first occasion, two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) on the second occasion and five hundred dollars ($500.00) upon all subsequent occasions; provided, however, that no such sanction shall be imposed upon any parent or legal guardian who enrolls the child at risk in a voluntary curfew program sponsored by the police department and/or such parent or legal guardian also enrolls and actively participates in an organized parenting program sponsored by any governmental, church, civic or community organization. 
(f)  Each day during which conduct prohibited by this section occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
(g)  Nothing contained herein shall be read or construed as superseding the right of law enforcement officials to, in proper instances, foregoing institution of any charge for violation of this section when, in the judgment of said officials, it would be appropriate to initiate action against an adult for violation of state law prohibiting adults from contributing to the delinquency of a minor, or for criminal child abuse and/or child neglect. 
(Ord. of 3-17-94, § II) 
Sec. 16-233. - Prohibition against lingering or prowling. 
(a)  It is unlawful for any person to linger or prowl within one hundred (100) feet of any business. It is also unlawful for any person to linger or prowl in any other place, at any time or in any manner not usual for law abiding persons under circumstances that warrant justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern that the person seeks to possess, buy, sell or distribute any deadly weapon, illegal intoxicant or otherwise commit any crime or offense or attempt to entice others to do so. 
(b)  As used herein, the expression "linger" means remaining outdoors in any location in which the individual does not have a ownership interest or leasehold while: 
(1)  Repeatedly stopping or attempting to stop or interfere with the free passage of others; 
(2)  Repeatedly engaging in or attempting to engage others in conversation; and/or 
(3)  Repeatedly stopping or attempting to stop motor vehicles, any one or more of these activities with the purpose of possessing, buying, selling or distributing any deadly weapon, controlled substance, illegal intoxicant or for committing or attempting to commit any crime or offense or enticing others to do so. 
(4)  Approaching others for the purpose of possession, buying, selling, or distributing any deadly weapon, controlled substance, illegal intoxicant or for committing or attempting to commit any crime or offense or enticing others to do so. 
(c)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm or immediate concern as set forth in subsection (a) is warranted is whether a person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm of immediate concern by requesting that the person identify himself, explain his presence and conduct and demonstrate that he is unarmed. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer did not comply with this procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person is true and, if believed by the officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern which gave rise to the initial intervention by law enforcement. 
(d)  Any person found guilty of unlawful lingering or prowling hereunder shall be punished as set out in section 1-16 of this Code. 
(Ord. of 3-17-94, § III) 
Sec. 16-234. - Prohibition against maintaining nuisances.

(b)  As used herein, the expression "illegal activity upon, or nuisance related to" any premises means:

(2)  Possession, sale or distribution of unlawful substances, products or services upon the premises by any person upon the premises; 
(3)  Knowing failure to report possession, sale or distribution of drugs by third parties upon the premises; 
(4)  Possession, storage, sale or other transfer of stolen property or other contraband within the premises by any person upon the premises; or 
(5)  Any other activity classified as a violation, misdemeanor or felony under any applicable municipal, county, state or federal law by any person upon the premises. 
(c)  Upon receipt of written notice for law enforcement authorities that a specified unlawful activity or nuisance has occurred upon the premises, the owner, occupant or other person or legal entity with a right of use and possession of that premises shall cooperate with law enforcement officials by immediately taking such steps as are detailed in the written notice aimed at abatement of the nuisance or unlawful activity so described, including, but not limited to, the eviction of wrongdoer tenants, the posting of the premises against trespassers, the authorizing of entry upon the premises by law enforcement officers or such other actions as are necessary, efficient or prudent. Refusal to cooperate with a valid law enforcement request for assistance shall constitute knowing failure to abate the nuisance or unlawful activity upon the premises as prohibited in subsection (a) of this section. 
(d)  In the event that an owner, occupant or other person or legal entity with the lawful right to the use and enjoyment of the premises who, after receiving written notice as set out herein, knowingly and willfully fails or refuses to cooperate with law enforcement in the abatement of any unlawful activity upon, or any nuisance related to, the building or premises under his or her control, shall, in addition to other penalties set out herein, be solely responsible for payment of a special fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per occurrence to help defray the cost of police intervention to abate the nuisance or deter unlawful activity at the site. 
(e)  Nothing contained herein shall be read or construed as preventing law enforcement officials from foregoing commencement of action under this section when, in the judgment of such officials, it would be more appropriate to commence action under relevant state criminal or civil law. 
(f)  In addition to the remedies set out hereinabove, the city attorney is authorized to bring and maintain a civil proceeding in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction to permanently enjoin the maintenance of a nuisance or the continuation of unlawful activity upon any premises within the corporate limits of the city and/or for condemnation. In the event an action for condemnation is commenced, the city attorney shall cause the actual cost of nuisance abatement activities by law enforcement to be introduced at trial as an offset against fair market value of the property as provided by law. 
(g)  In addition to the public remedies as set out hereinabove, any person adversely affected by such prohibited activities may, in addition to any other remedy available in law or equity, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an order permanently enjoining the continued maintenance of a nuisance or of unlawful activity upon any premises within the corporate limits of the city.

    Development means the activity of improving a real property to the extent of adding value to the tax base through real property improvements, and the creation of employment opportunities. 
    Goals means the objectives of the city in offering the incentives, which generally includes:

    Incentive means a grant of any inducement having monetary value by the city that is offered to a person, firm, or corporation to pursue a development that encourages private investment and/or the creation/retention of jobs. The incentive may also include grants from other entities that the city may be able to obtain. 
    Incentive area means the area in which council has determined that the revitalization and redevelopment thereof is essential to preserving and improving the economy, society and culture of the city and enhancing the quality of life of the citizens thereof.

The council, at its discretion and on a case-by-case basis, but subject to the general eligibility criteria provided for in section 17-34 herein, may enter into an incentive agreement with a person, firm or corporation providing for incentives in order to encourage and support the development of real property within the incentive area. 
(b)  Incentive agreements. The incentives shall only be provided to an incentive recipient after an agreement has been entered into between the city and such person, firm or corporation, which agreement shall set forth: the particulars of the development; the incentives to be provided; and sufficient assurances that the benefits will accrue to the city and the goals will be met by the development (an "incentive agreement"). Pending the approval by the council of any incentive agreement and subject to the provisions of section 17-35 herein, the mayor and city administrator are authorized to discuss the provisions of this economic development incentive program, aid in the completion of any proposal (as defined herein) and, subject to the final approval by council, negotiate with the potential incentive recipient on behalf of the city. Each incentive agreement shall be approved by council by ordinance. Council is authorized to provide incentives in any amounts and for any period of time within the thresholds provided for herein or within the time periods and thresholds provided for in any applicable statutory authorization. 
(Ord. of 12-15-16(1)) 
Sec. 17-33. - Authorized incentives. 
(a)  Multiple incentives. Council may provide to an incentive recipient any combination of incentives provided for herein; provided, however, that the total amount of incentives given to a development must be in keeping with the goals and the value of the benefits accruing to the city (and its citizens) and must be greater than the financial value of the incentives to an incentive recipient. 
(b)  Incentives of the city. All direct incentives of the city shall be granted in the form of reimbursements and refunds of fees and taxes that have been duly paid to the city. No upfront abatements of fees or taxes shall be permitted. Where incentives continue for a period of more than one year, such incentives may be graduated to increase or decrease year-to-year as the council sees fit, but subject to monitoring by the city to ensure compliance with the terms of any incentive agreement. Council may, at its discretion and on a case-by-case basis, enter into an incentive agreement to reimburse or refund any person, firm or corporation the following fees and taxes up to the amounts and percentages provided for herein: 
(1)  Up to one hundred (100) percent of the applicable [tax] fees collected by the city; 
(2)  Up to fifty (50) percent of the building permit fees collected by the city; 
(3)  Up to fifty (50) percent of the business license fees collected by the city for as many as five (5) years; 
(4)  Up to fifty (50) percent of the local hospitality taxes collected by the city for as many as five (5) years, but funds received through such incentive are to be spent only for purposes that are related to tourism, pursuant to S.C. Code § 6-1-730, and which have been approved by council and included in the incentive agreement; 
(5)  Up to fifty (50) percent of the local accommodations taxes collected by the city for as many as five (5) years, but funds received through such incentive are to be spent only for purposes that are related to tourism, pursuant to S.C.

(6)  Such other incentives that council, at its discretion on a case-by-case basis, determines are appropriate given the amount or type of investment made by the incentive recipient in the investment area. 
(c)  State incentive programs. The state programs that may be considered by council to be included within any package of incentives or as a stand-alone set of incentives for in-city projects located outside of the development area, include the following: 
(1)  Property tax credits authorized by the provisions of the South Carolina Abandoned Buildings Revitalization Act, S.C. Code Ann. § 12-67-100 et seq.

(3)  The South Carolina real property tax credit for the installation of a fire sprinkler system, S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3622. 
(Ord. of 12-15-16(1)) 
Sec. 17-34. - Eligibility criteria. 
(a)  General eligibility criteria. Except for those state incentives discussed in subsection 17-33(c), above, as authorized by the state and which are intended by the terms of this economic development incentive program to be applied city-wide, in order for a development to be eligible to receive incentives, the council must determine that the development meets, or upon completion will meet, each of the following criteria: 
(1)  The development is consistent with the Georgetown 2011 Comprehensive Plan (as may be amended) as well as the goals. 
(2)  Absent the provision of incentives, the development would be unlikely to occur or unlikely to occur at the level or scale contemplated by the developer. 
(3)  The development must be located within the incentive area, as defined in section 17-31, above. 
(4)  The development must have a minimum threshold investment of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) (the "minimum investment"). The minimum investment may be comprised of any combination of: 
a.  Real property acquisition costs; 
b.  The costs of physical improvements to real property; or 
c.  The costs of capital improvements to city infrastructure. 
The minimum investment may be calculated based upon investment in a single property or the cumulative investment in multiple properties, each within the incentive area. Where multiple uses or businesses are to be located within a single development as separate businesses, the council may, at its discretion on a case-by-case basis, allocate appropriate portions of the total investment in the development to such separate business in order to allow such business to meet the minimum investment eligibility requirement. In order to meet the threshold for the minimum investment, a development may be given a credit towards the minimum investment of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for each job (as defined herein) that will be created by the development. 
(5)  The intended use of the development must be for one or more of the following business purposes: 
a.  Retail uses; 
b.  Tourism-related business or activities; 
c.  Cultural arts activities and associated businesses; 
d.  Corporate headquarters; 
e.  Research and development; 
f.  High technology growth businesses; and 
g.  Other uses, as may be determined by the council, that are consistent with the goals, the comprehensive plan and the master plan. 
(b)  Specific criteria. Council may, at its discretion and on a case-by-case basis, include within an incentive agreement any other eligibility criteria that must be met upon completion of a development in order to ensure that the goals are met and that the development provides benefits to the city (and its citizens) in amounts that warrant the implementation of incentives. 
(Ord. of 12-15-16(1)) 
Sec. 17-35. - Application and award. 
(a)  Application for incentives. Except where an applicant seeks only those state incentives discussed in subsection 17-33(c) above, in order to be eligible for incentives, a person, firm or corporation must submit to the office of the mayor and city administrator a proposed set of incentives for a development (a "proposal"). The proposal must include a sufficient description of the development, to include, without limitation, the following information: 
(1)  Identification of the property or properties on which the development is to be located (the "subject property") and any acquisition costs thereof; 
(2)  The estimated start date and completion date for any work to be performed on the subject property; 
(3)  A list of any physical improvements that are to be made to the subject property as part of the development, including a good-faith estimate of the costs thereof; 
(4)  The then-current value of the subject property and a good-faith estimate of the value of the subject property upon completion of the improvements thereto; 
(5)  A good-faith estimate of the number of jobs that the development is projected to create, including an estimate of the date upon which the estimated number of jobs will have been created; 
(6)  A statement affirming that, based upon any acquisition costs for the subject property, along with good-faith estimates for the costs of physical improvements and the number of jobs created, the development will meet or exceed the minimum investment requirements of subsection 17-34(a)(4); 
(7)  A good-faith estimate of other revenue for the city that will be created as a direct result of the development, including anticipated business license fees, additional property tax revenue, capital improvements to city-owned infrastructure and utilities revenue; and 
(8)  any other additional information that the incentive recipient or the mayor or city administrator deems may be necessary and helpful for council to evaluate and give due consideration to the proposal. 
(b)  Determination of award and incentive amounts. The determination of an incentive award lies within the sole discretion of city council. The amount of incentives granted to a development shall be based upon the amount of the capital investment in the development, the amount of new revenue for the city directly created by the development and the number of new jobs that will be directly created by the development. The amount of incentives granted to a development shall in no case exceed the value of the direct and indirect benefits of the development to the city. These amounts shall be expressly included within any incentive agreement. Economic development incentives under this article may be the subject of a closed council meeting, § 30-4-70(a)(5), SC Code. The final incentive offer shall be authorized by ordinance. Consistent with the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act and upon request per city policy, documents related to an economic development incentive offer and/or its fiscal impact may be released after: 
(1)  The offer to attract the business to invest in the city is accepted by the business to whom it was made; and 
(2)  The public announcement of the project or finalization of the incentive agreement, whichever occurs later (§ 30-4-40(a)(9)). 
(c)  Certification, commencement and continuation of incentives. 
(1)  No incentive shall commence or be given until such time as the development has been issued a certificate of occupancy and/or a business license as well as a certificate that all terms and benchmarks included within the applicable incentive agreement, including without limitation benchmarks for capital investment, property valuation, and job creation (the "benchmarks"), have been fully achieved or otherwise completed. 
(2)  Where benchmarks, such as the number of jobs created, are to be met continuously over a period of time, the incentive recipient shall provide to the city, on an annual basis, sufficient proof that the development has continuously achieved or otherwise complied with such benchmarks. 
(3)  If, at any time after completion of a development or at any time within the period of time during which a development is granted incentives, a development fails to achieve or otherwise comply with a benchmark, council may, at its discretion and on a case-by-case basis, declare the incentive agreement null and void and refuse to grant any future incentives; or decrease the amount of incentives based upon the actual direct and indirect benefits of the development to the city and its citizens. 
(Ord. of 12-15-16(1)) 
Sec. 17-36. - Administration of incentive agreements. 
    The administration of the application process, specifically including the drafting of any proposal, presentation for council's consideration, and continuous monitoring of developments pursuant to applicable incentive agreements shall be the responsibility of the mayor and city administrator and any person designated to oversee such process by the mayor and city administrator.

When any real estate shall be sold under any writ, order or proceeding in any court, the court shall, on motion of any person interested in such real estate or in the purchase or proceeds of the sale thereof, order all taxes, assessments, penalties and costs charged thereon to be paid out of the proceeds of such sale as a lien prior to all others.

When the taxes and assessments or any portion thereof charged against any property or person on the duplicate for the current fiscal year are not paid on or before the first day of November or thirty (30) days after mailing the tax notices, whichever occurs later, the city finance director shall add a penalty of five (5) per cent on the city duplicate and the city finance director shall collect the penalty; and if the taxes, assessments, penalty and costs are not paid on or before the twenty-second day of November, a penalty of seven (7) per cent must be added by the city finance director on the city duplicate and collected by the city finance director; and if the taxes, assessments, penalty and costs are not paid on or before the fifteenth day of December, a penalty of fifteen (15) per cent must be added by the city finance director on the city duplicate and collected by the city finance director; if the taxes, assessments, penalties and costs are not paid on or before the fifteenth day of December, the city finance director shall issue his tax execution to the official authorized and directed to collect delinquent taxes, assessments, penalty and costs for their collection. Only the penalty at time of payment applies. No penalty shall be cumulative. The United States postmark is the determining date for mailed payments. 
(b)  Execution against defaulting taxpayer. After the city finance director issues his execution against a defaulting taxpayer, signed by him or his agent in his official capacity, directed to the officer authorized to collect delinquent taxes, assessments, penalty and costs, requiring him to levy the execution by distress and sale of so much of the defaulting taxpayer's estate, real or personal, or both, as may be sufficient to satisfy the taxes, assessments, penalty and costs, the officer to which the execution is directed shall: 
(1)  On January first or as soon thereafter as practicable, mail a notice of delinquent property taxes, penalty, assessments and costs, to the person at the address shown on the tax receipt or at a more correct address if it is known. The notice shall specify that if the taxes, penalty, assessments, and costs are not paid, the property must be duly advertised and sold to satisfy the delinquency. 
(2)  If the taxes remain unpaid after thirty (30) days of mailing of delinquent tax notices, or as soon thereafter as practicable, take exclusive possession of so much of the defaulting taxpayer's property as is necessary to satisfy the payment of the taxes, assessments, penalty and costs may be taken. In the case of real property, exclusive possession is taken by mailing a notice of delinquent property taxes, assessments, penalty, and costs to the defaulting taxpayer at the address shown on the tax receipt or to a more correct address known to the officer, by "Certified Mail, return receipt requested-deliver to addressee only." In the case of personal property, exclusive possession is taken by mailing the notice of delinquent property taxes, assessments, penalty and costs to the person at the address shown on the tax receipt or to a more correct address known to the official. All delinquent notices shall specify that if the taxes, assessments, penalty, and costs are not paid on or before a subsequent sales date, the property must be duly advertised and sold for delinquent property taxes, assessments, penalty and costs. The return receipt of the "certified mail" notice is equivalent to "levying by distress." 
(3)  In the event the "certified mail" notice has been returned, take exclusive physical possession of the property against which the taxes, assessments, penalty, and costs were assessed by posting a notice at one or more conspicuous places on the premises, in the case of real estate, reading: "Seized by person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes of City of Georgetown to be sold for delinquent taxes," the posting of the notice is equivalent to levying by distress, seizing, and taking exclusive possession of personalty. In the case of personal property, the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes is not required to move the personal property from where situated at the time of seizure and further, the personal property may not be moved after seized by anyone under penalty of conversion unless delinquent taxes, assessments, penalty, and costs have been paid. Mobile homes are considered to be personal property, unless the owner gives written notice to the county auditor of the mobile home's annexation to the land on which it is situated. 
(4)  The property must be advertised for sale at public auction. The advertisement must be in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Georgetown, and must be entitled "Delinquent Tax Sale." It shall include the delinquent taxpayer's name and the description of the property, a reference to the county auditor's map-block-parcel number being sufficient for a description of realty. The advertising must be published once a week prior to the legal sales date for three (3) consecutive weeks for the sale of real property, and two (2) consecutive weeks for the sale of personal property. All expense of the levy, seizure, and sale must be added and collected as additional costs, and shall include, but not be limited to, the expense of taking possession of real or personal property, advertising, storage, identifying the boundaries of the property, and mailing certified notices. When the real property is divisible, the city finance director shall ascertain that portion of the property that is sufficient to realize a sum upon sale sufficient to satisfy the payment of the taxes, assessments, penalty and costs. In such cases, said official shall partition the property and furnish a legal description of it. 
(c)  Advertised property must be sold. The property duly advertised must be sold by the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes at public auction at the City Hall or at the Courthouse on a legal sales date during regular hours for legal tender payable in full on the date of the sale. In case the defaulting taxpayer has more than one item advertised to be sold, as soon as sufficient funds have been accrued to cover all of the defaulting taxpayer's delinquent taxes, assessments, penalty and costs, no further items may be sold. All property sold will be sold subject to the terms of the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act of 1940. 
(d)  Successful bidder at delinquent tax sale. The successful bidder at the delinquent tax sale shall pay legal tender to the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes in the full amount of the bid on the day of the sale. Upon payment, the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall furnish the purchaser a receipt for the purchase money and attach a copy of the receipt to the execution with the endorsement of his actions which must be retained by him. Expenses of the sale must be paid first and the balance of all delinquent tax sale monies collected must be turned over to the city finance director. All other monies received, including any excess due the defaulting taxpayer after payment of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalty, and costs, must be retained, paid out, and accounted for by the city finance director or delinquent tax collector. 
(e)  Failure to remit. It case the successful bidder fails to remit in legal tender within the time specified, the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall cancel that bid and duly readvertise the same property for sale, in the same manner, on a subsequent delinquent tax sale date. The defaulting bidder is liable for no more than three hundred dollars ($300.00) damages upon default, which may be collected by suit by the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes in the name of the City of Georgetown. 
(f)  Redemption of items of real estate. The defaulting taxpayer, any grantee from the owner, or any mortgage or judgment creditor may within twelve (12) months from the date of the delinquent tax sale redeem each item of real estate by paying to the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalty, and costs, together with eight (8) per cent interest on the whole amount of the delinquent tax sale bid. If prior to the expiration of the redemption period, the purchaser assigns his interest in any real property purchased at a delinquent tax sale, the grantee from the successful bidder shall furnish the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes a conveyance, witnessed, and notarized. The city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall replace the successful bidder's name and address with the grantee's name and address in the delinquent tax sale book. 
(g)  Cancellation of sale. Upon the real estate being redeemed, the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall cancel the sale in the tax sale book and note thereon the amount paid, by whom and when. The successful purchaser, at the delinquent tax sale, shall promptly be notified by mail to return the tax sale receipt to the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes in order to be expeditiously refunded the purchase price plus the eight (8) per cent interest. 
(h)  No redemption period for personal property. For personal property, there is no redemption period subsequent to the time that the property is struck off to the successful purchaser at the delinquent tax sale. Upon payment by the successful purchaser and delivery of the duplicate warrant (i.e. tax receipt) with description and notation by the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes, he shall deliver to the successful purchaser the following form properly executed which is his bill of sale and right of possession: 
"Sold to ____________ at Delinquent Tax Sale on ____________ , who is the successful purchaser of personal property sold for delinquent taxes. 
_____
City Finance Director or Official 
Charged with Tax Collection" 
(i)  Notice. Neither more than forty-five (45) days nor less than twenty (20) days prior to the end of the redemption period for real estate sold for taxes, the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall mail a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested-deliver to address only, to the owner of record immediately preceding the end of the redemption period at the best address of the owner available to the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes that the real property described on the notice has been sold for taxes and if not redeemed by paying taxes, assessments, penalty, costs and eight (8) per cent interest on the bid price in the total amount of $ ____________ dollars on or before (12 months from date of sale) (date), a tax title will be delivered to the successful purchaser at the tax sale. The return of the certified mail "undelivered" is not grounds for a tax title to be withheld or be found defective and ordered set aside or canceled of record. 
(j)  Tax title. Upon failure of the defaulting taxpayer, any grantee from the owner, or any mortgage or judgment creditor, to redeem realty within the time period allowed for redemption, the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall, within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as possible, make a tax title to the purchaser or the purchaser's assignee. Delivery of the tax title to the clerk of court is considered "putting the purchaser (or assignee) in possession." The tax title shall include, among other things, the name of the defaulting taxpayer, the date of the execution, the date the realty was posted and by whom, and the dates each certified notice was mailed to the party or parties of interest, to whom mailed and whether or not received by the addressee. The successful purchaser (or assignee) is responsible in the amount of fifteen dollars ($15.00) for the cost of the tax title plus any documentary stamps necessary to be affixed and recording fees. The successful purchaser (or assignee) shall pay the amounts to the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes before delivery of the tax title to the clerk of court and upon payment, the city finance director or the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes is responsible for promptly transmitting the tax title to the clerk of court for recording and remitting the recording fee and documentary stamps cost. In case the tax sale of an item produced an overage in cash above the full amount due in taxes, assessments, penalty, and costs, the overage shall belong to the defaulting taxpayer to be claimed or assigned according to law. If neither claimed nor assigned within five (5) years of date of public auction tax sale, the overage shall escheat to the general fund of the City of Georgetown. Prior to the escheat date unclaimed overages must be kept in a separate account and must be invested so as not to be idle and the City of Georgetown is entitled to the earnings for keeping the overage. On escheat date the overage must be transferred to the general funds of said city. 
(k)  Official may void tax sales. In the case that the city finance director or the official in charge of the tax sale discovers before a tax title has passed, the failure of any action required to be properly performed, the city finance director or such official may void the tax sale and refund the amount paid to the successful bidder. If the full amount of the taxes, assessments, penalty and costs have not been paid, the property must be brought to tax sale as soon as practicable. 
(l)  Evidence of good title. In all cases of tax sale, the deed of conveyance, whether executed to a private person or a corporation, must be held and taken as prima facie evidence of a good title in the holder, that all proceedings have been regular and that all legal requirements have been complied with. No action for the recovery of land sold under this ordinance or for the recovery of the possession may be maintained unless brought within two (2) years from the date of sale, as provided by state law. 
(m)  Contract for collection of taxes. The City of Georgetown may contract with the County of Georgetown for the collection of municipal taxes by the county, as provided for in Section 12-51-170, Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1976.

New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property; the new work shall be differentiated from and subordinate to the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the historic property and its environment. 
h.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(Ord. of 4-20-17) 
Sec. 21-84. - Minimum expenditures for rehabilitation. 
(a)  HRTA owner-occupied. The owner's expenditures for rehabilitation must equal or exceed twenty (20) per cent of the fair market value of the building at the time of preliminary certification.

(4)  For HRTA, costs necessary to maintain the historic character or integrity of the building. 
(Ord. of 4-20-17) 
Sec. 21-85. - Process. 
(a)  Fees. Fees may be charged for each application, preliminary certification, final certification, and inspection of rehabilitation work at the rates set forth from time to time in the official city records on file with the city clerk. Fees are payable to the City of Georgetown, and final certification will not be given without payment all fees. 
(b)  Application and plan required. Owners of property seeking approval of rehabilitation work and preliminary certification must submit an application to the city to include a plan, prior to beginning work. For the HRTA, the applicant shall submit supporting documentation that the property has an historic designation as defined in section 21-82(2)b., hereinabove. If the applicant is seeking historic designation in conjunction with the application, he or she shall, in conjunction with staff, initiate the process for city council review under section 1600.304, zoning ordinance. No action on preliminary certification will be taken unless and until the historic designation is achieved. 
    The city's design review process is for city standards. The owner bears responsibility for whether plans are consistent with state and/or federal historic standards. 
(c)  Preliminary certification. Upon receipt of the completed application, the proposal shall be: (1) reviewed by staff (RPRTA), or (2) placed on the next available agenda of the ARB to determine if the project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation in section 21-83(2) hereinabove. After the ARB makes its determination, which may or may not include review by the South Carolina Department of Archives and History, the owner shall be notified in writing. Upon receipt of this determination the owner may: 
(1)  If the application is approved by staff (RPRTA) or, a certificate of appropriateness issued (HRTA), the owner may deliver the preliminary certification to the Georgetown County Tax Assessor in accordance with the two-year initial rehabilitation tax assessment, and begin rehabilitation in accordance with the city's building permit requirements; 
(2)  For the HRTA, if the application is not approved, revise such application for the ARB. 
(d)  Substantive changes. Once preliminary certification is granted, substantive changes must be approved by the city or the ARB. Unapproved substantive changes are conducted at the risk of the property owner and may disqualify the project from eligibility. Additional expenditures will not qualify the project for an extension on the special assessment. 
(e)  Final certification. 
(1)  Inspection. The chief building inspector will inspect completed projects to determine if the work is consistent with the approved application or certificate of appropriateness. Upon verification that the project is consistent with the preliminary certification and that expenditures have been made in accordance with section 21-84, the city shall issue final certification. 
(2)  Notice. The city shall, upon final certification, notify the Georgetown County Assessor that such property has been duly certified and is eligible for the city's historic rehabilitation tax assessment or low and moderate income rental property rehabilitation tax assessment. Any further or other process with the Georgetown County Assessor is the responsibility of the property owner. 
(3)  Assessment. Upon receiving final certification, and the city's providing notice to the county, city property tax will be assessed for the remainder of the two (2) year initial special assessment period, if any, on the appraised value of the property at the time the preliminary certification was made, and for the next eighteen (18) years at the greater of: (1) the appraised value of the property at the time of preliminary certification, or (2) forty (40) per cent of what the assessment would be on the appraised value after rehabilitation (ref. section 21-80). 
(4)  Term. The final certification for the rehabilitation tax assessment shall remain valid and apply for twenty (20) years from preliminary certification, including the tax year in which it was first issued, absent decertification (ref. sections 21-80 and 21-84(h)). 
(f)  Time limits. Upon receiving preliminary certification, a property may be assessed on the value of the property at the time of the preliminary certification. Such assessment shall be for a period ending two (2) years after the preliminary certification date, during which the project must be completed and final certification received. 
    If the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation have been incurred but the rehabilitation project has not been completed before the final certification deadline, the property owner may apply for a one time extension. Upon receipt of a written extension application and supporting documentation and for good cause shown, the city may grant an extension of the final certification deadline for an additional reasonable period not to exceed two (2) years. 
    If a completed project does not comply with all requirements for final certification before the deadline and no extension has been granted, any monies not collected by the city due to the special assessment must be paid to the city with interest at the rate charged for delinquent tax payments. 
(g)  Additional work. For the remainder of the special assessment period after final certification, any remodeling or construction on the property, other than ordinary maintenance, shall be subject to a certificate of appropriateness to include a finding that the overall project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation. If the certificate of appropriateness does not issue with this finding, the property owner may withdraw the request, revise the proposed additional work demonstrating that the reasons given for denial have been addressed (ref. section 1600.2(7), zoning ordinance), or face decertification. 
(h)  Decertification. When the property has received final certification and has been assessed as rehabilitated property, it remains so certified and must be granted the HRTA or RPRTA through the end of the special assessment period or until the property becomes decertified by any one of the following: 
(1)  Written request from the owner to the director of finance for the City of Georgetown for removal of the HRTA or RPRTA; or 
(2)  Rescission because of any change, alteration, or renovation which causes the property to no longer possess the qualities which made it eligible (ref. section 21-82). Notification of rescission and/or decertification shall be given to the owner, the city finance director, and the Georgetown County Assessor. 
(i)  Tax year effective. If an application for preliminary or final certification is filed by May 1 or the preliminary or final certification is approved by August 1, the special assessment authorized herein is effective for that year. Otherwise, it is effective beginning with the following year. In no instance may the special assessment be applied retroactively.

Sec. 22-178. - Drought management plan. 
(a)  Introduction: 
To ensure that the City of Georgetown is prepared to maintain operation of its water system during the severe demands associated with supplying water during drought-related periods, the City of Georgetown authorizes its water utilities department to develop an organized drought management plan which shall be used as the basis for maintaining necessary system operation, reliability, proper communications, effective coordination, and ultimate allocation of water use. Prior planning will compliment the city water utilities' ability to respond to drought conditions and to enforce the related ordinance. 
The drought management plan will consist of elements listed in section 22-178 of this article. Specific details which are subject to change as system operating personnel or system requirements change will be listed separately in a drought management plan supplement. The supplement will be maintained as a separate document and updated annually by the city's water utilities department. A copy of the drought management plan supplement shall be kept on file at the city clerk's office. 
(b)  Designation of water system drought response representative: The drought response representative for the City of Georgetown's Water Utilities Department shall be the city water utilities department manager. 
(c)  Description of water system layout, water sources, capacities and yields: A description of specific system layout, sources, capacities, yields, and the water filtration and distribution systems shall be contained in the drought management plan supplement. 
(d)  Identification of water system specific drought or water shortage indicators: The city water utilities department has developed triggers for use during drought or demand water shortages that describe when specific phases of this drought response article are implemented. The system triggers are as follows: 
Moderate drought phase 
1.  Pee Dee River water level at the intake of the I.P. Canal falls below the-3 feet level. 
Severe drought phase 
1.  Pee Dee River water level at the intake of the I.P. Canal falls below the -5 feet level; or 
2.  I.P. implements supplemental pumping at the mouth of the canal to sustain canal levels for a period exceeding seven (7) consecutive days; or 
3.  I.P. implements a surcharge for additional pumping expense incurred at the mouth of the canal. 
Extreme drought phase 
1.  Pee Dee River flow less than nine hundred (900) cubic feet per second for ten (10) consecutive days; or 
2.  I.P. implements supplemental pumping at the mouth of the canal to sustain canal levels for a period exceeding fourteen (14) consecutive days. 
(e)  Cooperative agreements and alternative water supply sources: To establish a comprehensive drought management program, the City of Georgetown seeks to develop and maintain administrative agreements with other water supply agencies. Agreements with other water purveyors may be necessary to provide alternative water supply sources. Other agreements will be sought with large commercial users that strengthen water conservation needs. The City of Georgetown commits to the development of cooperative agreements with neighboring water utilities and authorizes the city water utilities department to develop these agreements. The city clerk shall maintain a copy of these agreements which shall be available for public review. 
(f)  Description of predrought planning efforts: Before the occurrence of a water supply shortage and the need to implement the emergency provisions of this article, it is important that certain preresponse measures be taken with the aim of conserving the system's source water as well as the water distributed to the customer. In regards to the conservation measures listed below, the city water utilities department shall take the following actions: 
1.  Identify all major water users of the system. Top ten (10) per cent include wholesale customers and residential customers. 
2.  Identify water systems with which there are conservation agreements. 
3.  Formulate a vigorous public education program. 
This information shall be maintained and updated annually and provided as required or requested by city or state officials. 
(g)  Capital planning and investment for system reliability and demand forecasting: 
Capital improvements to the water utilities system strongly enhance the ability to get through times of drought. It is important that the City of Georgetown aggressively plans and builds for future needs. The city's water utilities department shall continue to provide for system operation flexibility, improved pumping and storage capacity, and new technologies to ensure that the demands of tomorrow are being prepared for today. 
To meet these requirements, the City of Georgetown does hereby authorize the water utilities department to develop and/or include within its five-year capital improvement plan projects which will enhance the city's ability to sustain potable water supplies during periods of drought and increasing water demand. 
(Ord. Of 8-21-03) 
Sec. 22-179. - Drought response plan. 
(a)  Declaration of policy and authority: 
The objective of this drought response article is to establish authority, policy, and procedure by which the City of Georgetown will take the proper actions to manage water demand during a drought-related shortage. This article satisfies the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000 and has the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use, sanitation, and fire protection and of allocating water for other purposes in an equitable manner. 
This article outlines the actions to be taken for the conservation of water supplied by the City of Georgetown's Water Utilities Department. These actions are directed both towards an overall reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply. 
To satisfy these requirements, the City of Georgetown does hereby adopt the following regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water. This article is hereby declared necessary for the protection of public health, safety, and welfare and shall take effect upon its adoption by the City of Georgetown. 
If it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to drought, the mayor and city council are authorized to issue a proclamation that existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual water use demands. The proclamation is for the purpose of preventing the depletion of water supply for intended human consumption, sanitation, fire protection, and/or other sustaining other essential needs. 
Immediately upon issuance of the proclamation, regulations and restrictions set forth under this article shall become effective and remain in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the proclamation has been rescinded. 
Water uses that are regulated or prohibited under this article are considered to be nonessential, and continuation of such uses during times of water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water, subjecting the offender(s) to penalties. 
(b)  Moderate drought phase: Upon notification by the drought response committee that a moderate drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or based upon data supplied by the city water utilities department, the mayor and council for the City of Georgetown shall initiate an appropriate response. Data for decision-making is to be based on trigger levels. The City of Georgetown will seek voluntary reductions from its customers in the use of water for all purposes and voluntary reductions on using water during certain peak water demand periods. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of twenty (20) percent in residential water use, fifteen (15) percent in other water uses such as commercial, industrial, institutional, and irrigation, and a reduction in overall water use of fifteen (15) percent. To accomplish this, the mayor and council will take the following actions: 
(1)  Issue a proclamation to be released to local media, City of Georgetown's water utilities customers, and to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center that moderate drought conditions are present. 
(2)  Provide written notification to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the service area of the water system the voluntary conservation measures that the customers are requested to follow during moderate drought conditions, including: 
a.  Reduction in residential water usage to seventy-five (75) gallons per person per day and a maximum of three hundred (300) gallons per household per day; 
b.  Eliminate the washing down of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, tennis courts, and other hard surfaced areas; 
c.  Eliminate the washing down of buildings for purposes other than immediate fire protection; 
d.  Eliminate the flushing of gutters; 
e.  Eliminate the domestic washing of motorbikes, boats, cars, etc.; 
f.  Eliminate the use of water to maintain fountains, reflection ponds, and decorative water bodies for aesthetic or scenic purposes, except where necessary to support aquatic life; 
g.  Reduction of watering of lawns, plants, trees, gardens, shrubbery, and flora on private or public property to the minimum necessary. Encourage outdoor watering to be done during off-peak hours. 
h.  Reduction in the amount of water obtained from fire hydrants for construction purposes, fire drills, or for any purpose other than firefighting or flushing necessary to maintain water quality; and 
i.  Limit normal water use by commercial and individual customers including, but not limited to, the following: 
(i)  Cease serving water in addition to another beverage routinely in restaurants; 
(ii)  Cease maintaining water levels in scenic and recreational ponds and lakes, except for the minimum amount required to support aquatic life; 
(iii)  Cease water service to customers who have been given a ten-day notice to repair one or more leaks and have failed to do so. 
(3)  Intensify maintenance efforts to identify and correct water leaks in the distribution system. 
(4)  Cease to install new irrigation taps on the water system. 
(5)  Continue to encourage and educate customers to comply with voluntary water conservation. 
(c)  Severe drought phase: Upon notification by the drought response committee that a moderate drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or based upon data supplied by the city water utilities department, the mayor and city council shall initiate an appropriate response. Data for decision-making is to be based on trigger levels. The City Of Georgetown will seek voluntary reduction in the use of water for all purposes and mandatory restrictions on nonessential usage and restrictions on times when certain water usage is allowed.

Additional conservation options: 
(1)  All residential water customers are encouraged to voluntarily reduce overall monthly water usage to seventy (70) per cent of the customer's monthly average. If voluntary reduction of usage is not successful, the City of Georgetown may, at its option, implement the following excessive use rate schedule for water: 
Tier I 0-225 gallons/REU Regular rate Tier II 226-400 gallons/REU 2 times regular rate Tier III Over 400 gallons/REU 3 times regular rate  
(2)  Impose a drought surcharge per thousand gallons of water that increases with higher usage. The general principle behind the drought surcharge is that the fee is imposed on water use in excess of seventy (70) per cent of normal residential use. The drought surcharge is a temporary fee imposed during the current water supply shortage and is not a cost-based rate. The drought surcharge is temporary and shall be terminated at such time as the City of Georgetown determines the water supply is at or above the trigger levels. 
(3)  If the conservation measures of this article or the plan prove inadequate to mitigate the effects of the drought conditions or water supply availability, the City of Georgetown may at its option take additional actions including, but not Limited to: 
(i)  Decreasing the gallon/REU limits in the different tiers; and 
(ii)  Decreasing the water system pressure as needed. 
(4)  Publicize widely the penalties to be imposed for violations of mandatory restrictions and the procedures to be followed if a variance in the restrictions is requested. 
(5)  Expand the use of education and public relations efforts as conducted under the moderate and severe drought phase and emphasize the penalties associated with violating the mandatory restrictions. 
(6)  Provide written notification monthly to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center regarding the success of the mandatory restrictions. 
(f)  Rationing: If a drought threatens the protection of public health and safety, the City of Georgetown's Water Utilities Department is hereby authorized upon written approval from the mayor and city council to monitor water use and limit households to fifty-five (55) gallons per household member per day. Domestic water use above this limit will be subject to a surcharge if the city water utilities department deems that adequate conservation measures have not been implemented. 
(g)  Schedule of rates, deposits, and miscellaneous charges: All rates, deposits, and miscellaneous charges for service shall be adopted and amended from time to time by ordinance of the city council. A schedule of all such rates, deposits, and charges in effect will be maintained and on file in the office of the City Clerk of the City of Georgetown, South Carolina. 
(h)  Fines and penalties: 
Except as otherwise stated herein, violations of any provision of this article shall be considered a misdemeanor and fines shall be issued as established in section 1-16 of this Code. 
The aforementioned fines and penalties may be in lieu of or in addition to any other penalty provided by law. 
After issuing one warning by certified mail, the city water department may disconnect the water service of any person or customer whenever it is determined that such person has failed to comply with the provisions of this article. Services disconnected under such circumstances shall be restored only upon payment of a reconnection charge and any other costs incurred by the water department in discontinuing service. In addition, suitable assurances must be given to the water department that the same action shall not be repeated during the drought or water shortage. 
(i)  Enforcement: 
Law officers of the City of Georgetown's Police Department shall, in addition to duties imposed by law, diligently enforce the provisions of this article. 
Management employees of the water department and fire department have the duty and are hereby authorized to enforce the provisions of this article and shall have the power and authority to issue written notices to appear when violations of this article occur during any declared moderate, severe, or extreme drought or water shortage. 
(j)  Exceptions: The mayor and city council have the authority to delay implementation of this article or any other part thereof when good cause is evident. 
(k)  Variances: 
Customers, who in their belief are unable to comply with the mandatory water use restrictions of this drought response article, may petition for a variance from restrictions by filing a petition with the City of Georgetown Water Utilities Department within ten (10) working days after the issuance of the proclamation requiring water use restrictions. All petitions for variance shall contain the following information: 
a.  Name and address of the petitioner; 
b.  Purpose of water usage; 
c.  Special provision from which the petitioner is requesting relief; 
d.  Detailed statement as to how the curtailment declaration adversely affects the petitioner; 
e.  Description of the relief desired; 
f.  Period of time for which the variance is sought; 
g.  Economic value of the water use; 
h.  Damage or harm to the petitioner or others if petitioner complies with this article; 
i.  Restrictions with which the petitioner is expected to comply and the compliance date; 
j.  Steps the petitioner is taking to meet the restrictions from which the variance is sought and the expected date of compliance; and 
k.  Other information as needed. 
In order for the variance to be granted, the petitioner must demonstrate clearly that compliance with this article cannot be technically accomplished during the duration of the water supply shortage without having an adverse impact upon the best interests of the community. The mayor and city council are authorized to grant the request for variance. 
In addition, the mayor and city council are authorized to grant temporary variances for existing water uses otherwise prohibited under this article if it is determined that failure to grant such variances could cause an emergency condition adversely affecting health, sanitation, and fire protection for the public. No such variance shall be retroactive or otherwise justify any violation of this article occurring prior to the issuance of the variance. Variances granted by the mayor and city council shall include a timetable for compliance and shall expire when the water supply shortage no longer exists, unless the petitioner has failed to meet specified requirements. 
(l)  Status of this article: 
(1)  If any portion of this article is held to be unconstitutional for any reason, the remaining portions of this drought response article shall not be affected. 
(2)  The provisions of this article shall prevail and control in the event of any inconsistency between this article and other rules and regulations of the City of Georgetown. 
(3)  Nothing in this article shall be deemed to invalidate or be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with any covenants now in effect and given as security to holders of bonds secured by revenues of the system.

(2)  The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the utility, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested, any backflow preventers on his premises. 
(3)  The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer which is revealed by periodic testing. 
(4)  The owner shall inform the utility of any proposed or modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the owner is aware but has not been found by the utility. 
(5)  The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place. (Ref. drawings on file at the utility office.) 
(6)  The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved by the department. (Drawings on file at the utility office.) 
(7)  The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the department and the utility. 
(8)  Any owner having a private well or other private water source, must have a permit if the well or source is cross-connected to the utility's system. Permission to cross-connect may be denied by the utility. The owner may be required to install a backflow preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the utility's system. 
(9)  In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water for domestic purposes on the utility's side of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed. 
(10)  The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for permits, annual or semiannual device testing, retesting in the case that the device fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspections for noncompliance with department or utility requirements. 
(11)  The owner shall be responsible for verifying that the individual performing testing and repair of backflow prevention devices is in possession of a valid South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control certification as a tester of backflow prevention devices and a valid tester permit issued by the utility. 
(Ord. of 6-15-95) 
Sec. 22-227. - Clarifications and recommendations. 
(a)  Degree of hazard. The utility recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from cross-connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention devices or double check valves. 
(b)  Residential dual check. Effective the date of the acceptance of this cross-connection control program for the Georgetown city water utility, all new residential buildings will be required to include a residential dual check device immediately downstream of the water meter. Such device shall be provided and installed by the water utility. Associated costs shall be included in the meter setting fee. (Ref. drawing on file at the utility office.) Installation of this residential dual check device on a retrofit basis on existing service lines will be instituted by the utility at the time of any repair of the meter assembly, or otherwise on a reasonable time schedule. Associated costs shall be factored into the overall customer rate structure. 
The owner must be aware that installation of a residential dual check valve results in a potential closed plumbing system within his residence. As such, provisions may have to be made by the owner to provide for thermal expansion within his closed loop system, i.e., the installation of thermal expansion devices and/or pressure relief valves. 
(c)  Low hazard residential irrigation system. Each low hazard residential irrigation system connection shall be protected by the minimum of an approved double check valve assembly. 
(d)  Strainers. The utility strongly recommends that all new retrofit installations of reduced pressure principle devices and double check valve backflow preventers include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device. The installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs, water main breaks, fires, periodic cleaning and flushing of mains, etc. These occurrences may "stir up" debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers. 
(Ord. of 6-15-95; Ord. of 12-15-05) 
Sec. 22-228. - Permits. 
    The utility shall not permit a cross-connection within the public water supply system unless it is considered necessary and that it cannot be eliminated. 
(1)  Cross-connection permits that are required for each backflow prevention device are obtained from the utility. A fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) will be charged for the initial permit and five dollars ($5.00) for the renewal of each permit. 
(2)  Permits shall be renewed every year and are nontransferable. Permits are subject to revocation and become immediately revoked if the owner should so change the type of cross-connection or degree of hazard associated with the service. 
(3)  A permit is not required when fixture isolation is achieved with the utilization of a nontestable backflow preventer. 
(Ord. of 6-15-95) 
Sec. 22-229. - Existing in-use backflow prevention devices. 
    Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the utility to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to an approved device, or an approved device must be installed in the event that no backflow device was present. 
(Ord. of 6-15-95) 
Sec. 22-230. - Periodic testing. 
(a)  Reduced pressure principle backflow devices and double check valve assemblies shall be tested and inspected at least annually. 
(b)  Testing shall be performed by the utility's certified tester or other approved contractor or tester. This testing will be done at the owner's expense. 
(c)  Testing by the utility shall be conducted during the utility's regular business hours. Exceptions to this, when at the request of the owner, may require additional charges to cover the increased costs to the utility. 
(d)  Any backflow preventer which fails during a test shall be repaired or replaced at the owner's expense. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at owner's expense to insure correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty (30) days after the test date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two (2) devices is an effective means of the owner insuring uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity. (Ref. drawing on file at the utility office.) 
(e)  Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified in (a) above, in cases where there is a history of test failures and the utility feels that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional test will be borne by the owner. 
(Ord. of 6-15-95; Ord. of 12-15-05) 
Sec. 22-231. - Records and reports. 
(a)  Records. The utility will initiate and maintain the following: 
(1)  Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections. 
(2)  Master files on customer cross-connection permits. 
(3)  Copies of permits and permit applicants. 
(4)  Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the department. 
(b)  Reports. The utility will maintain the following for inspection by the department: 
(1)  Initial listing of low hazard cross-connections. 
(2)  Initial listing of high hazard cross-connections. 
(3)  Annual update lists of items (1) and (2) above. 
(4)  Annual summary of cross-connection inspections. 
(Ord. of 6-15-95) 
Sec. 22-232. - Fees and charges. 
    The utility will publish a list of fees or charges for the following services or permits: 
(1)  Testing fees. 
(2)  Retesting fees. 
(3)  Fee for re-inspection. 
(4)  Charges for after-hours inspections or tests. 
(Ord. of 6-15-95) 
Sec. 22-233. - Tester approval. 
    Any contractor, technician, or individual performing testing of backflow prevention devices must possess an appropriate, valid certification from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, and a valid City of Georgetown business license. The utility shall not be required to accept the results of any test performed by any person not possessing a valid business license from the City of Georgetown. 
(Ord. of 6-15-95; Ord. of 12-15-05) 
Sec. 22-234. - Remedial action. 
(a)  Administrative fines. 
(1)  When the utility finds that an owner, contractor, or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any other state or federal standard or regulation regarding cross-connection control, the utility may fine such violator in an amount not to exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of one per cent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one per cent per month. A lien against the violator's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(3)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  Any owner, contractor, or person who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or any other state or federal standard or regulation regarding cross-connection control, shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) but not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. 
(2)  The city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement or emergency response activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained by the violator through the violation, corrective actions by the violator, the compliance history of the violator, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a violator. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution.

703 Master Planned District (amended 5-16-19)
703.1 Master Planned (MP) districts are established for the purpose of encouraging innovative land
planning and site design concepts that support a high quality of life, and that achieve a high quality of
development, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency, and other City goals as follows:
a. Reducing or diminishing the uniform design that results from the strict application of zoning
and development standards that are designed primarily for individual lots.
b. Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, open space, and design
amenities.
c. Allowing greater freedom in providing a well-integrated mix of residential and non-residential
land uses throughout the development and on individual lots, including a mix of housing types,
lot sizes, and densities. Mixed uses are strongly encouraged.
d. Providing of an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets, and
thereby lowering development and housing costs.
e. Promoting quality design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing
development to take advantage of special site characteristics, locations, and uses.
f. In specific instances, encouraging quality design and environmentally sensitive development
by allowing increases in residential density or non-residential square footage when such
increases can be justified by superior design or the provision of additional amenities, such as
public open space and natural storm water features.
g. Architectural style must reflect the historic character of the City of Georgetown.
703.2 Master Planned District Types
703.201 Master Planned Residential (MP-R): The intent of the MP-R district is to provide a mix
of residential uses using innovative and creative design elements, while at the same time
providing an efficient use of open space. Limited commercial uses will be allowed in the MP-R
district to serve the needs of the residents in the development, unless it can be demonstrated
that commercial/retail targeted towards the larger community is justified.
703.202 Master Planned Commercial (MP-C): The intent of the MP-C district is to provide
mixed-use retail and office development, with limited moderate and higher-density residential
uses integrated into the development above street levels and as separate stand-alone uses.
MP-C districts must utilize at least two (2) uses.
703.203 Master Planned Business/Industrial Park (MP-BIP): The intent of the MP-BIP district is
to encourage the development of a mix of employment and residential uses (office, research,
light industrial, limited commercial, and high-density residential) on appropriate corridors within
the city in a planned and aesthetically pleasing way. This is done by allowing design flexibility as
well as a mix of uses that are reviewed as a plan for development.
703.3 Principles of Master Plans
703.301 Foundation for Standards: The City of Georgetown Zoning Ordinance serves as the
foundation of regulations applying to the project. Unless the Master Plan Exhibits or Terms
and Conditions document specifically call out deviation from Zoning Ordinance standards, the
current Zoning Ordinances standards at time of creation of the Master Plan apply.
Environmental regulations such as wetland buffers and open space should only be modified
when the specific intent of those regulations within the Zoning Ordinance is met. Other types of
regulations, such as but not limited to, land-use buffers, parking standards, and amenities may
be modified based on the unique design of the project, provided that the general intent of the
regulations within the Zoning Ordinance is met.
703.302 Status of Exhibits: The Master Plan and other attached exhibits are specifically
designed to reflect the overall design intent, as well as the required elements and commitments
defined for the project. No inadvertent detail or graphic not clearly specified on the exhibits is
intended to contradict the specific requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. The Master Plan and
other attached exhibits are intended to be conceptual in nature, with civil and construction
drawings submitted and reviewed according to the process set forth in the Land Development
Regulations and/or Zoning Ordinance for individual buildings and other project components as
the overall plan is developed.
703.303 Order of Control: In the case of contradiction, the order of control is:
1. The Master Plan Terms and Conditions;
2. The Master Plan or other exhibits where specific details have been called out;
3. The Zoning Ordinance (if amended after the creation of this document, then the amended
version of the Zoning Ordinance applies); and
4. The Master Plan or other exhibits for general items that have not been specifically called out.

Master Planned districts are established through the creation of a Master Plan and associated Terms
and Conditions.
703.401 Master Plan: A master plan shall:
a. Be prepared by a licensed engineer, architect, landscape architect, or land planner;
b. Identify the general location of land uses within individual development areas, and the mix of
land uses;
c. Calculate the acreage, number, type, and mix of land uses, including the total number of
residential units, residential densities, and non-residential intensities within each development
area, and the total number, type, and mix of land uses for the entire Master Plan;
d. Identify the general location, amount, and type (whether designated for active or passive
recreation) of open space. Open space, as defined in Sec. 324 of the Zoning Ordinance, shall be
incorporated into the Master Planned District. A percentage based on the total acreage shall be
provided and approved by the Zoning Administrator and Planning Commission.
e. Identify the on-site transportation circulation system, including all public and private streets,
existing or projected transit corridors, pedestrian and bicycle pathways, and how such on-site
improvements will connect with existing adjacent city facilities. Pervious asphalt shall be used
to decrease storm water runoff;
f. Identify the location of environmentally-sensitive lands such a wetland buffers, wildlife
habitat, streams, open space, historic trees, floodplains, and wetlands;
g. Establish the general location of on-site water and wastewater facilities, and how these would
connect to the existing utility infrastructure in the area;
h. Identify the general location of all public facility sites serving the development, including
transportation, water, wastewater, parks, emergency management services, storm water
management, and schools.
703.402 Terms and Conditions document (narrative) must include the following components:
a. A brief statement of planning objectives and intent for the project;
b. A completed Impact Analysis of the proposed rezoning and answers to the following
questions:
1. Does the zoning proposal permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and
development of adjacent and nearby property?
2. Does the zoning proposal adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or
nearby property?
3. Does the property to be rezoned have a reasonable economic use as currently zoned?
4. Will the zoning proposal result in a use that could cause an excessive or burdensome
use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools?
5. Is the zoning proposal in conformity with the policies and intent of the Land Use Plan?
6. Are there existing or changing conditions that affect the use and development of the
property which support either approval or denial of the zoning proposal?
7. Does the zoning proposal permit a use that can be considered environmentally adverse
to the natural resources, environment and citizens of the City of Georgetown?
c. A list of principal and accessory uses allowed, and by what mechanism (permitted by right, by
conditional uses, or by special exception);
d. Any modification being requested from use-specific standards for principle and accessory
uses;
e. Lot standards (such as but not limited to setbacks, land-use buffers, height, density, and size
of buildings);
f. Development and design standards on topics such as but not limited to parking, landscaping,
exterior lighting, amenities, signage, and architectural design.
703.403 Other Exhibits: Depending on the particular project, other exhibits may be included as
well. Examples include the following:
a. Traffic Impact Analysis: In cases where a proposed Master Planned district triggers the
threshold requirements given in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation
Manuel, a traffic impact study shall be required (ref. Sec. 409 of the Land Development
Regulations).
b. Phasing Plan: If the Master Planned district is proposing to have multiple phases, a
development phasing plan must be provided that identifies the general sequence or phases in
which the land is proposed to be developed, including how residential and non-residential
development will be timed, how infrastructure (public and private) and open space will be
provided and timed, and how development will be coordinated with the Citys capital
improvements program. The phasing plan may allow modification based on future market
conditions and demands.
c. Conversion Schedule: The Master Plan may include a conversion schedule that identifies the
range of conversion that may occur between different types of residential and non-residential
uses.
d. Other Specialized Plans: Other specialized plans, such as but not limited to the following, may
be included as well: a lighting plan; a signage plan; and open space plan; a landscaping plan (as
pertains to Article XIII, Overlay District for Main Corridors); an amenities plan; and architectural
renderings, elevations, or examples.
e. Bonds: A surety bond (performance or contract) shall be provided to guarantee the
satisfactory completion of the project by the developer or contractor.
703.5 General Standards for Master Planned Districts
The following general standards shall apply for all Master Planned districts.
703.501 Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan: The Master Planned zoning district
designation and the Master Plan shall be consistent with the current City of Georgetown
Comprehensive Plan.
703.502 Compatibility with Surrounding Areas: Development along the perimeter of a Master
Planned District must be compatible with adjacent existing or proposed future development. In
cases where there are issues of compatibility, the Master Plan shall provide for transition areas
at the edges of the Master Planned district that allow for appropriate buffering and/or ensure a
complementary character of uses. Complementary character is identified based on
densities/intensities, lot size and dimensions, street and block grid pattern, building height,
building mass and scale, hours of operation, exterior lighting, landscaping, and siting of service
areas.
703.503 Consistency with the Zoning Ordinance: Along with the consistency to the current
Comprehensive Plan, the Master Planned zoning district and development shall conform to the
minimum standards of the City of Georgetown Zoning Ordinance, including the Overlay District
where applicable, unless more stringent standards are detailed in the Terms and Conditions
section of the Master Planned district design.
703.504 Location: All Master Planned districts may be located anywhere within the city as long
as other standards of this ordinance can be met.
703.505 Size: Minimum size restrictions are as follows:
a. Master Plan-Residential (MP-R) districts shall be at least three (3) acres.
b. Master Planned Commercial (MP-C) and Master Planned Business/Industrial Park (MP-BIP)
districts shall be at least five (5) acres.
*However, City Council may reduce these size requirements where appropriate based on physical
development constraints, protection of environmentallysensitive natural areas, or the
promotion of a community goal when more conventional development or subdivision would be
difficult or undesirable give the constraints on development.

and repaired from time to time, as necessary, and perpetually maintained in safe condition, free from
deterioration, defective or missing parts, or peeling or faded paint, and able to withstand the wind
pressure for which such sign was originally designed and able to meet the structural standards described
in the building code.
1021.7 Any sign not in compliance with this provision is hereby declared to be a nuisance and a
prohibited sign. If the sign is declared to be a nuisance, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the
appropriate person(s) by certified mail that the condition must be corrected within a specific time
period. If no action is taken within the time period by the person(s) charged with maintaining such sign,
the Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to remove or have removed the sign deemed a nuisance,
at the person(s) expense, in addition to being subject to all penalty provisions of this ordinance.
1022 Repair and Reconstruction of Off-Premise Signs
Should any sign be damaged by acts of God, weather, unintentional harm or negligence or should any
off-premise sign deteriorate due to failure to properly maintain said sign to the point that the cost of
repair is greater than fifty (50) percent of the total replacement cost of the physical sign structure, the
City shall not grant any permits for the repair or reconstruction of the sign.
1023 Removal of Signs Erected on Public Property or Rights-of-Way
It shall be unlawful to erect, use or maintain a sign or sign structure on public property or public right-ofway
without the approval of the City of Georgetown. The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to
remove or have said signs removed. The Zoning Administrator shall attempt to contact the owner(s) of
signs and store said signs, (size permitting) for a total of ten (10) days. If signs have not been claimed
and picked up within the ten (10) days, signs shall be disposed of.
1024 Indemnification
All persons involved in the maintenance, installation, alteration, or relocation of signs near or upon any
public right-of-way or property shall agree to hold harmless and indemnify the City, its officers, agents,
and employees against any and all claims of negligence resulting from such work.
1025 Revoking Permits
The Zoning Administrator may revoke and require the return of any permit by giving written notice using
certified mail to the permit holder, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for
any substantial departure from the approved application or plans and specifications, for refusal or
failure to comply with the requirements of any applicable State or local laws or local ordinances or
regulations, or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. A permit
mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable State or local law or local ordinance or regulation also
may be revoked.
1026 Severability and Conflict
This ordinance and its various parts are hereby declared to be servable. If any section, clause, provisions
or portion of this ordinance is declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such decision shall not affect the validity of either this ordinance as a whole or any parts not declared
invalid or unconstitutional.
If any part of this ordinance is found to be in conflict with any other ordinance of the City of
Georgetown, the most restrictive or highest standard shall prevail.
1027 Enforcement
Signs, which are found to be in violation of the provision of this article, shall be subject to the following
provisions. Where notice is required, such notice shall be by certified mail and may be reasonable under
the circumstances surrounding the violation. Notices shall be addressed to the last known address of the
sign owner.
(1) Notice of violation. The Zoning Administrator shall send notice, by certified mail to the sign
owner, stating the nature of the violation and granting an appropriate period of time to correct
the violation.
(2) In the event the certified mail is not accepted, notification of the violation shall be posted on
the sign with a description of the violation and timeline to remedy the violation.
(3) Continued violation. In the case where the Zoning Administrator has sent notice to the sign
owner, or posted the sign when notice is not accepted and granted an appropriate period of
time to correct the violation and the violation has not been remedied a citation may be issued to
the sign owner. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
(4) Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

ARTICLE XI: OFF-STREET PARKING
1100 Off-street Parking
Off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided on each lot on which any of the
following uses are hereafter established except in the Core Commercial District. The number of parking
spaces provided shall be at least as great as the number specified herein for various uses. When
application of said provision results in a fractional space requirement, the next larger requirement shall
prevail. Parking requirements in the Core Commercial District shall be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
1100.1 All off-street parking areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to extraordinary
movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street.
1100.2 Off-street parking areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency, and
other public service vehicles can serve such developments.
1100.3 Every off-street parking space shall be arranged so that any vehicle may be moved into and out
of such space without moving another vehicle.
1100.4 Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger
to pedestrians and without interfering with parking areas.
1100.5 The required parking areas for any development shall be paved and properly marked prior to the
issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance or a Temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance. The City
of Georgetown shall not accept any type of improvement guarantee in lieu of the completion of
required parking.
1100.6 Off-street parking in the Core Commercial District. The off-street parking requirements in this
Ordinance shall not apply to permitted uses in the Core Commercial District. The Zoning Administrator
shall determine the off-street parking requirements for conditional uses in the Core Commercial District.
1101 Site Plan Submission Requirements
As part of the normal site plan requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, parking and landscaping plans
shall be provided to the Building and Planning Department for review. These plans shall clearly illustrate
the proposed parking layout in relation to the building site, and the location of the required landscaping
buffers. Additionally, a proposed planting plan shall detail the location and species of all plants used to
fulfill these requirements. The plans need not necessarily be prepared by a registered architect or
landscape architect. Information regarding the proposed surfacing of the lot shall also be included.
1102 Parking Space and Aisle Dimensions
Regular parking spaces intended for the use of standard sized automobiles shall have a minimum
dimension of nine feet by eighteen feet for non-angled spaces. Compact car parking stalls shall have a
minimum size of seven feet by fifteen feet, and may account for a maximum of ten per cent of the total
spaces provided. All compact stalls shall be marked by appropriate signage with a sign face no larger
than one hundred square inches. Parking spaces intended for the use of cars or trucks with boat trailers
attached are a minimum of ten feet wide and thirty-five feet long.
1102.1 Angled parking stalls. When angled parking stalls are chosen, they shall be provided with the
dimensions illustrated in the Approved Plant and Parking Space Dimension List maintained by the
building and planning department; and shall require the provision of traffic circulation aisle widths
specified below according to the degree of angle.
1102.2 Aisles. The width of all driving aisles between parking spaces shall be determined as designated
in Table 1102.2. The angle shall be measured between the centerline of the parking space and the
centerline of the aisle.

1102.3 Parallel parking. Parallel parking stalls for standard sized automobiles shall have a minimum size
of eight feet by twenty-three feet, and seven feet by nineteen feet for compact autos. All parallel
parking stalls shall have a minimum of twelve feet for maneuvering space in one-way traffic and twentytwo
feet maneuvering space for two-way traffic.
1102.4 Wheel stops . Wheel stops shall be required on all handicapped parking spaces, spaces that
abut sidewalks, and parking spaces that abut landscape areas where the parking area does not contain
curbing. Wheel stops shall be located thirty (30) inches on center from the front of the parking space.
The stop shall be a minimum of four (4) inches in height and shall have the capacity to stop both wheels
of a vehicle.
1103 Handicapped Parking Requirements
All handicap parking areas shall comply with the Building Codes and all state codes and be compatible
with ADA requirements and specifications for handicapped parking including but not limited to the
number of spaces, location of spaces, dimension of spaces, markings, signage, and accessibility to
sidewalks.
1103.1 Handicapped parking spaces. Table Inset 1103.1 shall govern the minimum number of
handicapped spaces that must be provided on the lot. Handicapped stalls shall have a minimum size of
twelve feet by eighteen feet, and shall be adjacent to a three-foot-wide handicapped-accessible
sidewalk that allows easy access to the building entrance. In the event of a conflict in the number of
spaces required under the provisions of the Standard Building Code, as adopted, the stricter regulations
shall apply.

Total Spaces in Lot Required Handicapped Spaces Total Spaces in Lot Required Handicapped Spaces
Up to 25 1 101 to 150 5
26 to 50 2 151 to 200 6
51 to 75 3 Over 200 4% of total
75 to 100 4
1103.2 Handicapped signage requirements. Handicapped stalls shall each display one handicapped
parking sign (international symbol of access) and the parking surface shall be identified with the
handicapped parking symbol and suitable pavement striping. Handicapped stalls shall be situated as
close to building entrances as is feasible.
1104 General Parking Requirements
All parking lots containing six or more spaces shall be composed of a dust-free surface, such as asphalt
paving, concrete, pea-gravel, or slag. Grass turf in the form of commercially produced sod shall be
allowed for parking lots containing between six and ten spaces (inclusive); but must be properly
maintained by the property owner and replaced when necessary to repair damage from vehicular or
pedestrian traffic. The first ten feet of any access driveway, measured from the edge of pavement of the
street, shall be surfaced in a manner consistent with the surfacing material of the street that the
driveway accesses. Coquina and/or dirt lots shall not be permitted. The property owner is encouraged to
utilize porous paver bricks or asphalt where feasible to allow surface water runoff to infiltrate the earth
without leaving the lot.
1104.1 Delineation of parking stalls. For all parking lots, regardless of the number of spaces and the
manner in which they are surfaced, each individual stall shall have its dimensions clearly marked with
white or yellow traffic paint if the lot is surfaced with concrete or asphalt; and with four inch by four
inch by twelve foot or larger landscape timbers firmly anchored to the parking surface for lots surfaced
in any other acceptable manner. A four inch by four inch by eight foot timber shall be installed across
the front of such stalls to act as a wheel stop.
1104.2 Protection of landscaping. Stalls shall be arranged in such a manner as to not allow any part of
an automobile to overhang across any required buffer strip if such overhang can endanger the required
landscaping, (i.e. bumper overhangs knocking over shrubs). To accomplish this, the property owner shall
be required to protect landscape buffers and islands with concrete border curbing, or in the case of
parking lots that are not surfaced with asphalt or concrete, large landscape timbers, or railroad ties.
1104.3 Provision for backing-room. Individual parking stalls located in parking pods that do not have
through-access shall not be allowed to abut a property line of landscaping buffer in such a manner that
there is no room for backing an automobile out of the stall. Parking stall layout shall include a turnaround
area of a minimum dimension as wide as the corresponding aisle and ten feet deep to prevent
this.
1105 Landscaping Requirements
Off-street parking areas containing six or more parking spaces shall be required to reserve a five-footwide
buffer strip along the exterior lot lines surrounding all automobile circulation and parking areas.
The exception to this is when a commercially zoned property does not abut any residentially used or
zoned parcels. In this case, the property owner shall be exempt from having to provide the buffer along
the rear yard property line if the rear yard is used only for merchandise delivery and employee parking.
Any customer parking that is located in the rear yard negates this exception. Within this buffer, trees
and shrubs shall be planted of a height and density to be determined by the Approved Plant and Parking
Space Dimension List.
1105.1 Trees in buffer areas. Regardless of varieties used, an approved tree must be planted at least
every thirty feet, with some species requiring smaller spacing, as determined by the Approved Plant and
Parking Space Dimension List. A maximum of fifty per cent of the required trees may be of the
ornamental variety, as determined by the plant list, with the remainder being shade trees. In addition,
no more than ten per cent of required trees may be represented by any pine species.
1105.2 Shrubs in buffer areas. The area between the required trees shall be planted with a dense strip
of bushes or other shrubbery that provides maximum opacity, while not inducing overcrowding of
planted material. Existing shrubs and trees that are on the approved plant list and meet the minimum
size requirements may be counted toward fulfilling this requirement. Trees and shrubs may be planted
in a staggered pattern within the required buffers, as opposed to a straight row, to provide for a more
visually appealing buffer.
1105.3 Owner's maintenance of planted materials. All plants used for landscaping shall be indigenous
to this climate and shall be properly maintained in a healthy, controlled manner by the property owner.
Any required planting material that dies or is allowed to lapse into a state of unhealthiness shall be
replaced by the property owner during the species' growing season.
1105.4 Alternate designs allowed. The Planning Commission may, at its discretion, approve an
alternate buffer design incorporating visually appealing fencing or earthen berms. The Building and
Planning Department may, at its discretion, approve alternate species not included on the approved
plant list if the property owner submits a letter from a registered landscape architect, horticulturist,
botanist, or plant nursery operator stating that the growing conditions in the City favor the healthy
growth and maintenance of that species. The Building Department may also require landscaping to be
installed in locations left empty from the parking layout, such as corner islands associated with angled
parking layouts, etc., at its discretion.
1105.5 Access between adjacent lots. One access drive of twenty feet in width shall be allowed to
connect adjacent parcels every one hundred linear feet, if both property owners so desire. This drive
may cut through the required side or rear yard perimeter buffer. A notarized letter of agreement signed
by both property owners in question shall be provided to the Building Department before an access
drive may be allowed between adjacent parcels.
1105.501 Parking lots abutting residentially used or zoned parcels. Wherever a parking lot
abuts a residentially used or zoned property, the required buffer strip shall be ten feet in width
along the property line separating them. The property owner shall then have the option of
doubling the amount of planted material provided in the buffer strip by staggering the
distribution of the plants, or installing a fence or wall constructed of suitable materials (to be
determined by the Zoning Administrator) in addition to the normal amount of landscaping
materials for a five-foot buffer strip.
1105.502 Interior landscape islands. For parking areas containing twenty-five or more spaces
the property owner shall reserve at least fifteen per cent of the total lot area minus the square
footage of the building(s) footprint for internal landscape islands in addition to any other
buffering requirements. These islands are to be at least fifty square feet in size and arranged in
such a manner as to break up broad expanses of paving and provide directional guidance for
both vehicular and pedestrian traffic flows. No individual island may be less than five feet in
width. At least seventy-five per cent of the required landscape islands must be located in that
section of the parking lot that contains the majority of customer parking. The property owner is
encouraged to landscape in areas immediately surrounding the principal building itself. To allow
for this, a maximum of fifteen per cent of the required square footage of internal landscape
islands may be accounted for with exterior building landscape treatments. These islands shall be
planted in a manner similar to the required perimeter buffer strips. Grouping of trees is
encouraged in the islands for visual appeal and variety.
1105.503 Landscaping in sight triangles. No landscaping that obscures vision may be placed in
any required sight triangle. The property owner is encouraged to plant low-growing (never
exceeding heights of three or more feet) ground cover as recommended in the approved plant
list within the sight triangles to provide a visually appealing treatment of the entrances to the
parcel. Trees whose lowest branches and canopy exceed ten feet in height may also be used in
the sight triangle.
1106 Timing of Installation of Required Improvements
Parking lots, with their attendant landscaping, must be completed before the issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy (CO), or in the case of a building remodeling or addition which does not require a CO, as a
condition of the issuance of a building permit or business license. However, under certain circumstances
such as unavailability of contractors, poor weather, or seasonal limitations to planting, the property
owner may obtain a conditional Certificate of Occupancy or business license, contingent upon the
completion of the parking and landscaping improvements detailed on the approved site plan within a
specified time frame to be decided by the Building Department, but not to exceed six months from the
date of issuance. Failure to install the necessary parking and landscaping by the specified date shall be
considered a misdemeanor, and shall be punishable by a fine of up to two hundred dollars and/or thirty
days in prison for each offense, with each day of noncompliance being considered a separate offense.
Under cases of special hardship, the Building Department may, at its discretion, grant one extension of
up to thirty days to the specified completion date, upon written request of the property owner.
1107 Nonconforming Parcels
Any use governed under these provisions that locates in an existing building on a parcel that was
nonconforming as of 12-15-94 [S.C. Code of Laws], with respect to any parking and/or landscaping
provision shall be exempt from the landscaping provisions herein; except those uses which are required
to provide ten per cent more parking spaces than were required of, or provided by, the previous
occupant of the structure. For parcels that do not meet the minimum size requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance, the Building Department may, at its discretion, grant up to a twenty-five-per cent variance
on the number of parking spaces required, or any landscaping provision herein. If that does not provide
sufficient relief, the property owner may submit a formal application to the Board of Zoning Appeals for
further relief. No expansion of an existing business that is nonconforming with respect to these parking
and landscaping standards may occur unless the property owner agrees to bring the use into full
compliance. The exception to this rule exempts commercial developments of two or more businesses
located in a common building and utilizing shared parking on one parcel of land (such as strip shopping
centers, malls, etc.). Any new use or combination of uses which cause the total number of parking
spaces required under these provisions to exceed one hundred and ten per cent of the total number of
existing spaces on the nonconforming parcel shall require the property owner to bring the entire parcel
into compliance with all parking and landscaping provisions herein.
1108 Parking Space Requirements
The number of off-street parking spaces to be provided shall be calculated as designated in Table 1108.
If the calculation of the required number of parking spaces results in a fractional or decimal number, the
number may be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

ARTICLE XII: TREE PROTECTION REGULATIONS; PRIVATE PROPERTY
Amended Ordinance 4/21/11
1200 Definitions
Tree: Any living, self-supporting perennial plant with a definitive crown, and which has a trunk diameter of
two inches or larger.
Protected Tree: Any tree which is classified as scenic, replacement, historic, or significant.
Replacement Tree: Any tree that is planted in order to replace an existing protected tree which is permitted
to be removed. Replacement trees must be at least two inches American Nursery Stock Standards, (typically
measured 6 inches above ground level) except if it is a tree being planted in order to fulfill the requirements
of the parking and landscaping provisions herein; in which case the sizes called for in the approved plant list
shall take precedence.
Historic Tree: Any tree to which local legend or lore has attached or which is known by a common name
within the community, as determined by the Planning Commission; or any tree whose DBH is at least four
times the diameter specified for that species under the definition of a significant tree. (Example: A Significant
Live Oak is 8 inches DBH, therefore an Historic Live Oak is 4 × 8 = 32 inches DBH). The one exception to this
formula is for Pine species; where the multiplier shall be two instead of four times the significant diameter.
(Ord. of 10-17-2002)
Scenic Tree: Any tree which, because of its size, shape, location, or other aesthetic feature is deemed by the
Planning Commission to significantly add to the scenic beauty of the general location in which it is situated.

Tree Damage or Abuse: Any intentional action which does not follow good arboricultural practices. Abuse
also includes excessive pruning which endangers survivability of the tree, damage inflicted upon roots by
machinery, changing the natural grade above the root system or around the trunk, and changing drainage
patterns so as to appreciably reduce the water supply necessary for the tree's survival.
Tree Expert: Any individual licensed as or who is otherwise a practicing landscape architect, arborist, forester,
or horticulturist.
Tree Removal: Any intentional or negligent act which will cause a tree to decline and die, including, but not
limited to, such damage inflicted upon the root system of a tree by application of toxic substances, the
operation of machinery, the change of natural grade by excavation or filling above the root system or around
the trunk of a tree, pruning, and damages from injury or fire inflicted upon trees which result in or permit
insect infestation.
Tree Topping: The severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the
crown of a tree to such a degree as to remove the normal canopy or disfigure the tree.
(Ord. of 10-17-2002)
1201 Tree Removal, Damage, or Abuse prohibited
It is hereafter prohibited for any person or other entity to cause or allow to be caused the removal, damage,
or abuse of any protected tree, as defined in Article III of this Ordinance, which is situated upon any privately
owned parcel of land within the corporate limits of the City of Georgetown without first obtaining a permit to
do so from the Zoning Administrator.
1202 Tree Topping Prohibited
It is hereafter prohibited for any person or other entity to prune a tree to the extent that such pruning is
considered to be tree topping.
1203 Protected Trees During Development
For parcels of land proposed for development, a minimum number of existing protected trees on the entire
parcel equal to ten protected trees per acre shall be saved. For parcels containing fewer than ten protected
trees per acre, the number of protected trees required to be saved shall equal the total already in existence
on the parcel. Any tree required under the parking and landscaping provisions herein may count toward
fulfilling the tree replacement requirements of this Article. Special consideration will be given to protected
trees situated within the one-hundred-year floodplain, as their removal can cause critical flooding and soil
erosion problems.
1204 Tree Protection Practices During Development
1204.1 Protective barricades required. Protective barricades shall be placed around all protected trees
located in the development area prior to the commencement of any work, and shall remain in place until
development activities are complete. The area within the protective barricade shall remain free of all building
materials, dirt or other construction materials, debris, machinery, vehicles and development activities.
Barricades shall be erected at a minimum distance from the base of a protected tree according to the
following standards:
1204.101 For protected trees under ten inches DBH, protective barricades shall be placed a
minimum distance of five feet from the base of each protected tree, or to the dripline,
whichever is greater.
1204.102 For protected trees greater than ten inches DBH, protective barricades shall be placed
a minimum distance of ten feet from the base of each protected tree, or to the dripline,
whichever is greater.
1204.2 Encroachment. Changes of grade or construction of impervious surfaces or utilities may be
permitted within the protective barricade subject to the following guidelines:
1204.201 Impervious surfaces may not be constructed within five feet of the base of any
protected tree smaller than ten inches DBH; nor within ten feet of the base of any tree ten inches
or larger DBH unless special construction techniques, including, but not
limited to, tree feeders and porous asphalt, are employed and certified as acceptable by a
reputable tree expert or other qualified person.
1204.202 All roots outside of the protective barricade to be removed during the development of
a parcel shall be severed clean and a two-inch layer of mulch shall be applied over the surface of
exposed roots.
1204.203 The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling
rather than trenching. No tunneling may occur within five feet of the trunk of a protected tree. If
roots must be cut, proper root pruning procedures must be employed.
1204.204 Moderate fill can be tolerated within a tree's critical root zone with the proper
utilization of an aeration system. Commercially available systems are subject to approval by the
City Grounds Maintenance Supervisor. A decrease in grade is best accomplished with the use of
retaining walls or with terracing.
1204.205 Where it has been determined by the City that irreparable damage has occurred to
protected trees within tree protective zones, the trees must be removed and replaced.
1204.206 Remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be required when
encroachment into the tree protective zone results in repairable damage to a protected tree.
Standard arboricultural practices, including, but not limited to, pruning, aeration, grade changes,
fertilization, or any other recommended practice made by City staff shall be employed to effect
remediation and repair.
1204.207 In the event of an appeal to any section of this Article, the City reserves the right to
employ the advice of professional foresters, horticulturists, arbor culturists, or any other
qualified tree expert in representing the best interests of the City.
1205 Tree Removal, Replacement, and Relocation.
1205.1 Removal of each protected tree or replacement tree without approval of the Zoning Administrator or
his designee is a violation of this Ordinance, and the violator may be subject to replacing trees in caliper
inches equal to the number of inches DBH removed from the site, in addition to the standard penalties for
violation of this Ordinance.
1205.2 Relocation is accomplished by relocating a protected tree, under the guidance of City staff, with a tree
spade on land under the same ownership which is to be developed pursuant to the same development order.
1205.3 Replacement for all sites. When development of a site will cause the number of protected trees
saved on a parcel to fall below the ten minimum specified under Section 1202, then the following
replacement schedule shall apply:
1205.301 Regardless of zoning classification, replacement of significant trees shall be on a one
tree to one tree ratio. Historic or scenic trees are governed under Section 1205.
1205.4 Replanting standards. To prevent a monoculture of tree plantings, the City of Georgetown requires a
diversity of trees to be planted:
Required Number of Replacement Trees:
1--3 trees: One type of replacement tree may be used.
4--8 trees: Minimum of 2 types of trees to be planted.
9--15 trees: Minimum of 3 types of trees to be planted.
16--50 trees: Minimum of 4 types of trees to be planted.
Over 50 trees: Minimum of 6 types of trees to be planted.
1205.5 For any protected tree situated in a one-hundred-year floodplain, the tree replacement requirements
shall be one and one-half the number required otherwise.
1205.6 Timing of tree replacement. All approved replacement trees must be planted within thirty days of the
first date of the recommended planting season for that species, as determined by a registered nursery
operator, landscape architect, tree expert or the City Grounds Maintenance Supervisor. Replacement trees
not so planted will constitute a violation of this Ordinance.
1206 Historic and Scenic Trees
It shall be unlawful to damage, remove, fell, injure, or abuse any historic or scenic tree. In the event that this
provision causes undue hardship upon a property owner, he or she may make application to the Board of
Zoning Appeals for relief from this provision. The property owner must provide proof that strict application of
this provision will exclude all reasonable use of the property as a building site. A successful appeal to remove
an historic or scenic tree will then necessitate the property owner to meet with the Zoning Administrator to
determine an acceptable schedule of replacement, depending on the value of the historic or scenic tree(s)
removed.
1207 Site Plan Submission Requirements
In addition to the information required on site plans pursuant to other sections of the Zoning Ordinance, site
plans for nonresidential and multi-family residential developments shall contain the following information:
1207.1 A registered survey of existing protected trees prepared by a South Carolina licensed Landscape
Architect, Surveyor or Civil Engineer. Such survey shall indicate the location, species, and size (DBH) of each
protected tree. Once such a comprehensive survey is on file with the Zoning Administrator, future treecutting
proposals may be applied for by updating the existing plan on file. Such updates may be submitted
without further requirements for certification by the engineer, architect, and landscape architect or surveyor.
1207.2 Trees to be retained with their location shown with reasonable accuracy.
1207.3 Specifications for protection of trees to be maintained during the development of the site.
1207.4 A tree replacement schedule in the event that the minimum number of trees per acre specified in
Section 1202 cannot be retained during the development process. Such schedule shall show the location,
species, and size of any trees to be removed from the site; and any that are to be planted in order to fulfill
replacement requirements.
1207.5 Site plans for single-family or duplex residential developments must show protected tree locations in
a reasonably accurate manner, but need not necessarily be prepared by a licensed surveyor, architect,
landscape architect, or engineer.
1207.6 No building permit shall be issued until the site plan has been reviewed and approved by the Building
Official or his designee. If the plan is disapproved or approved conditionally, the reasons for such action and
the necessary steps to gain full approval must be relayed to the developer.
1208 Exemptions and Exceptions.
1208.1 The Zoning Administrator may issue a letter authorizing immediate removal of a protected tree, in the
event that such tree shall be determined to meet one of the following criteria:
1. It is diseased, decayed, infested, or in a poor state of health that will likely significantly reduce
the natural life span of the tree; or
2. It is determined to pose a risk to life or property due to likely potential of limb and/or trunk
failure. The Zoning Administrator may consult the opinion of any recognized tree expert, as defined
herein, in concluding that there is the possibility of risk.
3. It is determined that, due to the significant tree's location within the building envelope on the
property, all reasonable use of the property is severely restricted or prohibited. The building
envelope is defined as the area of the lot remaining after all required setbacks have been applied.
"Reasonable use" for nonresidential uses is defined as having a minimum of seventy- five (75) per
cent of the building envelope unobstructed by a significant tree or trees (which may include the
tree's canopy). For residential uses, "reasonable use" is defined as having a minimum of thirty-five (35) per
cent of the building envelope unobstructed by a significant tree or trees (which may include the tree's
canopy).
1208.2 In the event of an emergency, such as a tornado, earthquake, hurricane, ice storm, flood or any other
act of nature, the Mayor or his assignee may order a suspension of this Article to allow for the cutting and
removal of felled or damaged trees without a permit until such time as is deemed appropriate.
1208.3 No provision of this Article shall be deemed to restrict the proper and necessary pruning or removal
of trees on private property by any utility company, as long as such actions are done according to good
arboricultural practices as specified by the City Tree Protection Board to the extent possible.
1208.4 Protected trees that need to be removed in order to carry out a permitted wetland alteration and/or
any mitigation action required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are exempt from the provisions of this
Article.
1208.5 Commercial timber operations shall be exempt from the provisions of this Article, except that a fiftyfoot-
wide perimeter buffer around the site of timber operations shall be maintained in which no trees may
be removed.
1208.6 Trees grown specifically for sale by commercial nurseries are exempt from the provisions of this
Article with respect to their removal from the commercial site upon which they are grown.
1208.7 Trees situated in whole or in part on publicly owned property are exempt from the provisions of this
Article. (Ord. of 10-17-2002)
1209 Permit Fees
1209.1 Residential property. A ten-dollar fee must be paid to the City to cover the costs of site plan approval
of any site plan in which protected tree removal is proposed.
1209.2 Commercial, industrial, institutional uses. A fifty-dollar fee must be paid in order to cover the cost of
site plan review of parking, landscaping, and tree removal/replacement plans.
1210 Fines and penalties.
Any person found guilty of violating any provision of this ordinance Article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
with each tree unlawfully removed, damaged, or abused considered to be a separate offense.

in writing all the parties involved of its decisions and the reasons therefore. (Ord. of 12-18-03)
1503 Appeals, Hearing, and Notice
Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by any officer, department, or board or
bureau of the City. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the
Board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board of Zoning Appeals notice
of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all
the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all legal
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken
certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated
in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or
by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause
shown.
The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matters referred to it, and give
public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable
time. At the hearing any party may appeal in person or by agent or by attorney. Public notice of all meetings
of the Board shall be provided by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least fifteen
days in advance of the meetings. In cases involving variances, conspicuous notice shall be posted on or
adjacent to the property affected, with at least one such notice being visible from each public thoroughfare
that abuts the property.
1504 Powers
The Board of Zoning Appeals has the following powers:
1504.1 To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in an order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance; and
1504.2 To hear and decide appeals for variances from the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance when strict
application of the provisions of the Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance may be
granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the Board makes and explains in writing the following
findings:
1504.201 There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece
of property;
1504.202 These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity:
1504.203 Because of these conditions, the application of the Ordinance to the particular piece
of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property;
1504.204 The authorization of the variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent
property or to the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting
of the variance; and,
1504.205 The Board may not grant a variance the effect of which would be to extend physically
a nonconforming use of land, or to change the zoning district boundaries shown on the Official
Zoning Map. The fact that property may be utilized more profitably, should a variance be
granted, may not be considered grounds for a variance.
1504.3 In exercising the above powers, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of
this Ordinance, reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or
determination of the Zoning Administrator and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from
whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. The Board, in the execution of
the duties for which appointed, may subpoena witnesses and in case of contempt, may certify such fact to
the Circuit Court having jurisdiction. All final decisions and orders of the Board must be permanently filed in
the office of the Board as a public record. All findings of fact and conclusions of law must be delivered to
parties of interest by certified mail.
1505 Appeals from Decisions of the Board of Zoning Appeals
Any person who may have a substantial interest in any decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may appeal
from any decision of the Board to the Circuit Court in and for the County of Georgetown by filing with the
Clerk of such Court a petition in writing setting forth plainly, fully and distinctly wherein such decisions is
contrary to law. Such appeal shall be filed within thirty days after the decision of the Board is rendered.

Section 2100 Intent of the REDD
The Georgetown City Council has determined that new heavy industrial uses are incompatible when in
close proximity to the citys downtown, waterfront, historic district, residential neighborhoods, and gateway
corridors and intersections. It has been further determined by the council that the discontinuance of
incompatible industrial uses is in the long-term interest of the city. These areas should be redeveloped in a
manner which improves property value, promotes economic development, and enhances the viability of
surrounding residential neighborhoods and businesses, while providing the owners of affected sites
flexibility in the transition and repurposing of their lands.
The intent of this Ordinance, and the districts created herein, is to provide a regulatory framework that
promotes the thoughtful redevelopment of industrial sites, industrial districts, and adjacent properties in
accordance with the City of Georgetowns Comprehensive Plan, including the future land use map, and the
City of Georgetowns Official Map. Specifically, the provisions of this Ordinance are designed in
furtherance of the comprehensive plan to encourage compatible redevelopment by:
1. Allowing a mixture of uses;
2. Prohibiting new heavy industrial uses while providing for the conditioned continuation of
existing nonconformities;
3. Promoting setback, height, and other bulk and dimensional restrictions that are compatible with
adjacent districts or provide for reasonable transition;
4. Providing density, height, parking, and other development bonuses and design modifications for
developments that provide additional open spaces or public amenities;
5. Protecting adjacent streets; and
6. Protecting adjacent waterfronts and preserving and/or creating viewsheds.
It is recognized that some aspects of the redevelopment and repurposing of former industrial sites may
occur in the short term and that other aspects may take years to accomplish. This article and the district
created by it provide for short and long-term redevelopment with multiple options designed to afford
flexibility to affected property owners. The purposes and intent of each district is further described in
Division 2.
Section 2101 Summary of Article Provisions
This article creates four redevelopment districts, including a base redevelopment district and three floating
zones. Each district allows, but does not require, a mixture of uses with permitted intensities and densities
varying by zone. Heavy industrial and similarly incompatible uses are prohibited in the four districts and
this article provides nonconformity standards to address the continuation and eventual cessation of these
pre-existing uses.
2
Properties may be rezoned by the City Council to the REDD base district to accommodate the repurposing
and transitioning of lands from incompatible industrial or other uses to activities and uses that are
economically viable and harmonious with the citys longstanding commercial and residential districts. The
base district allows for lower intensity nonindustrial development and retains many of the non-district
specific requirements of the citys zoning ordinance.
Property owners may choose to proceed with development under the standards of the base district; however,
this article provides the authority for the City Council to apply three floating zone options available within
the base redevelopment district, each of which are described herein. Property owners may petition for the
rezoning of their properties to one of these floating zones. The flexibility afforded by the floating zones
varies. Two of the floating zones require the approval by the City Council of a development plan and
development zoning text, collectively referred to as floating zone district standards. However, the proposed
standards must be in agreement with the comprehensive plan and the requirements of this article and must
be approved by the City Council. If approved by City Council, floating zone district standards govern future
development of the property within the floating zone.
Table 2101 provides an overview of the different requirements and options provided under the four REDD
districts.

Section 2102 Definitions Applicable to Article
3
In addition to the definitions set forth in Article III and elsewhere in this Ordinance, the following words,
terms, and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them by this section. All
other words, terms, and phrases not defined by this Ordinance shall be given their common, ordinary
meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
2102.1 Abandon (Abandonment): The relinquishment of property, a change of use, or the
discontinuance in the use of the property by the owner, regardless of intent, for a period of more
than three hundred sixty five (365) consecutive days or more than three hundred sixty five (365)
days in any two consecutive years.
2102.2 Affordable Housing: In the case of dwelling units for sale, housing in which mortgage,
amortization, taxes, insurance, and condominium or association fees, if any, constitute no more
than twenty-eight percent of the annual household income for a household earning no more than
eighty percent of the area median income, by household size, for the metropolitan statistical area
as published from time to time by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
and, in the case of dwelling units for rent, housing for which the rent and utilities constitute no
more than thirty percent of the annual household income for a household earning no more than
eighty percent of the area median income, by household size for the metropolitan statistical area as
published from time to time by HUD.
2102.3 Building Coverage: The horizontal area measured within the outside of the exterior walls
of the ground floor of all principal and accessory buildings. For properties in the REDD-B and
REDD-F1, building coverage is expressed as a percentage of lot area. For properties in the REDDF2
and REDD-F3, building coverage is expressed as a percentage of the net development area.
2102.4 Cluster Development (Clustering): The grouping of allowable uses within a subdivision or
development site, permitting a reduction in the otherwise applicable lot size, while preserving
substantial open space on the remainder of the parcel. Building and impervious coverage and
density in the REDD-F2 and REDD-F3 are based on net development area (not individual lot area)
allowing for clustering in these districts.
2102.5 Density: The number of dwelling units permitted per acre. For properties in the REDD-B
and REDD-F1, the number of dwelling units permitted is based on lot area. For properties in the
REDD-F2 and REDD-F3, the number of dwelling units permitted is based on the net development
area.
2103.6 Development Bonus: The provision of additional development capacity in the form of an
increase in allowable density, building coverage, impervious coverage or a decrease in required
open area. A development bonus may be granted as an incentive for the voluntary provision of
increased amenities or improvements of public benefit as identified in this article.
2102.7 Development Zoning Text: Written standards adopted by legislative action of the City
Council that, in addition to the standards imposed by this article and the approved development
plan, establish zoning requirements within the floating zone.
2102.8 Floating Zone: The zones described in the text of this article and adopted by legislative
action of the City Council, but which are unmapped unless a property owner petitions the City
Council to have the floating zone applied to a particular parcel meeting the minimum zoning district
4
area requirements of this Ordinance through action by the City Council, as authorized by S.C. Code
6-29-720(C)(2).
2102.9 Floating Zoning District Standards, or district standards. The REDD development plan
and development zoning text that collectively, when adopted by the City Council, in accordance
with this article, form the zoning requirements governing development in the REDD-F2 and
REDD-F3 floating zones.
2102.10 Force Majeure: An unforeseeable circumstance that prevents someone from fulfilling a
contract. This definition includes an event, occurrence, or circumstance reasonably beyond the
control of any party, including fires, earthquakes, lightning, floods, explosions, storms, adverse
weather, landslides and other acts of natural calamity or acts of God; strikes, grievances, actions
by or among workers or lock-outs (whether or not such labor difficulty could be settled by acceding
to any demands of any such labor group of individuals); which, by the exercise of due diligence,
such party could not have been able to avoid or overcome.
2102.11 Heavy Industry (heavy industrial): A use engaged in the basic processing and
manufacturing of materials or products predominately from extracted or raw materials, or a use
engaged in storage or manufacturing processes using flammable or explosive materials, or storage
or manufacturing processes that potentially involve hazardous or commonly recognized offensive
conditions such as smoke, noise, soot, dirt, vibrations, odor, noxious discharges, and adverse traffic
generation. Heavy industrial uses include but are not limited to the manufacture of chemicals
(including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, disinfectants, solvents, and related industrial and
household chemical compounds and any use involving the bulk storage of chemicals), fertilizers,
paper, petroleum products (including plastics and rubber), and steel and other metals; concentrated
feedlots; electric generation; oil and gas extraction and storage; incinerators; mining; animal
slaughter, packaging, and rendering plants; lumber mills; and recycling and salvage yards.
2102.12 Impervious Coverage: The area covered by an impervious surface expressed as a
percentage. For properties in the REDD-B and REDD-F1 districts, impervious coverage is
expressed as a percentage of lot area. For properties in the REDD-F2 and REDD-F3 districts,
impervious coverage is expressed as a percentage of the net development area.
2102.13 Impervious Surface: Any hard-surfaced, man-made area that does not readily absorb or
retain water, including but not limited to building roofs, paved asphalt and concrete parking and
driveway areas, sidewalks, swimming pools, and other paved areas.
2102.14 Light Industry (light industrial): A use engaged in the manufacture, predominately from
previously prepared materials, of finished products or parts, including processing, fabrication,
assembly, treatment, packaging, incidental storage, sales, and distribution of such products, but
excluding basic industrial processing. Light industry is capable of operation in such a manner as to
control the external effects of the manufacturing process, such as smoke, noise, soot, dirt, vibration,
odor, noxious discharges, and adverse traffic conditions.
2102.15 Net Development Area: The cumulative area of all lots and land including open space
within an individual district sharing common district standards but excluding streets, rights of way,
dedicated easements, wetlands, and ponds.

Division 2 Redevelopment Districts
Section 2120 Creation of Redevelopment Districts
2120.1 REDD Districts. In addition to the districts and overlays provided by articles VI and XIII, the
following districts are hereby created:
Base Redevelopment District (REDD-B)
Redevelopment District Floating Zone 1 (REDD-F1)
Redevelopment District Floating Zone 2 (REDD-F2)
Redevelopment District Floating Zone 3 (REDD-F3)
2120.2 District Citation. The individual districts may be cited by full title, e.g. Base Redevelopment District
or by abbreviated reference, e.g. REDD-B or REDD-B district. Collectively these districts and affected
properties may be referred to as the REDD, REDD districts or REDD properties. The requirements
for properties in the REDD-F2 and REDD-F3 are based on the floating zone district standards approved by
legislative action of the City Council. As these floating zones are applied, a unique name or identifier will
be used as a prefix to the zones title, for example: Georgetown Market Village REDD-F3.
2120.3 District Assignment. Except as provided in this article, properties may be zoned REDD-B and
REDD-F1 following the map amendment procedures as provided in Article XVIII of this Ordinance. The
application of REDD-F2 and REDD-F3 floating zones to a particular parcel also constitutes a text and map
amendment and requires compliance with Division 8 of this article, requisite to City Council consideration
and action.
Section 2121 REDD-B District
2121.1 District Intent. The intent of the Base Redevelopment District is to provide for lower intensity
nonindustrial development while protecting adjacent streets, waterways, and uses from encroachment. This
district provides for varying uses but limits intensity through setback, lot size, coverage, density, and other
standards. These standards are designed to promote compatible reuse while preserving the higher intensity
redevelopment potential of properties. It is anticipated that in the future, properties or portions of the REDDB
district may be rezoned to the higher intensity floating zones as property and development conditions
warrant.
2121.2 Eligibility for Designation. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 513, any property,
irrespective of lot size, within the city may be zoned as a Base Redevelopment District subject to conformity
with the comprehensive plan and the requirements of this Ordinance. A request to rezone a property to an
REDD-B may be initiated by the City Administrator, the Planning Commission, the City Council, or by the
owner of the property.
2121.3 REDD-B Dimensional and Density Standards. The following standards shall apply to properties
within the REDD-B district.
8
1. Minimum lot size. Each lot shall have a minimum area of ten (10) acres.
2. Minimum lot width. Each lot shall have a minimum lot width of three hundred (300) feet.
3. Building coverage. The total lot coverage permitted for all buildings shall not exceed ten (10)
percent of the lot area, except as provided by Section 2171.1(3).
4. Impervious coverage. The total lot coverage permitted for all impervious surfaces shall not
exceed twenty (20) percent of the lot area, except as provided by Section 2171.1(3).
5. Height limit. Building and structure height shall not exceed thirty five (35) feet. No building
shall exceed two (2) stories.
6. Setbacks. The minimum setback from property lines shall be as follows:
1. Front yard: Ninety (90) feet;
2. Rear yard: Fifty (50) feet;
3. Side yard: Forty (40) feet; and
4. Side yard abutting a public street: Sixty (60) feet.
7. Special setback from natural water body. The minimum setback from a natural water body shall
be one-hundred (100) feet. For tidal rivers, bays, or inlets this distance is measured from the
mean high water mark. This requirement does not apply to water-oriented uses that are
approved as a special exception by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
8. Open Area Required. No less than sixty (60) percent of the lot area shall be open area.
9. Open Space. Except as may be required for a conditional or special exception use, open space
is not required in this district.
10. Density. Where multi-family units are permitted as a special exception, density shall not
exceed two (2) units per acre (or fractional equivalent thereof) of lot area. REDD floating zones
may permit densities in excess of two (2) units per acre as expressly provided by this article.
2121.4 Uses. Uses permitted by right, by conditional use, and by special exception are provided in Division
IV of this article.
Section 2122 REDD-FI District
2122.1 District Intent. The intent of the Redevelopment District Floating Zone 1 is to provide for
development on smaller, pre-existing lots within the REDD. These lots by virtue of their size, location, or
lot width may not readily accommodate the setback and coverage requirements of the base district. Also,
due to their lot size, these smaller lots would not be eligible for consideration under the other floating zone
options provided by this article. This floating zone permits uses similar to the base district and provides
reduced setbacks and coverage requirements. This district also allows for light industrial uses as a special
exception. It is further intended that this district only be assigned in cases where the orientation of lots allow
9
for self-contained or stand-alone development that do not impact the development of adjacent properties or
conflict with the citys official map.
2122.2 Eligibility for Designation. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 513, any property within the
REDD-B district that constituted an existing lot of record of less than three (3) acres in area at the time of
this articles adoption may be zoned as a Redevelopment District Floating Zone 1 subject to conformity
with the comprehensive plan and the requirements of this Ordinance. A request to rezone a property to an
REDD-F1 district may only be initiated by the owner(s) of the property(s).
2122.3 REDD-F1 Dimensional and Density Standards. The following standards shall apply to properties
within the REDD-F1 district.
1. Minimum lot size. Each lot shall have a minimum area of one (1) acre.
2. Minimum lot width. Each lot shall have a minimum lot width of one hundred (100) feet.
3. Building coverage. The total lot coverage permitted for all buildings shall not exceed twenty
five (25) percent of the lot area.
4. Impervious coverage. The total lot coverage permitted for all impervious surfaces shall not
exceed thirty five (35) percent of the lot area.
5. Height limit. Building and structure height shall not exceed thirty five (35) feet. No building
shall exceed two (2) stories.
6. Setbacks. The minimum setback from property lines shall be as follows:
1. Front yard: Forty (40) feet;
2. Rear yard: Twenty (20) feet;
3. Side yard: Twenty (20) feet; and
4. Side yard abutting a public street: Thirty (30) feet.
7. Special setback from natural water body. The minimum setback from a natural water body shall
be one-hundred (100) feet. For tidal rivers, bays, or inlets this distance is measured from the
mean high water mark. This requirement does not apply to water-oriented uses that are
approved as a special exception by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
8. Open Area Required. No less than forty five (45) percent of the lot area shall be open area.
9. Open Space. Except as may be required for a conditional or special exception use, open space
is not required in this district.
10. Density. Where multi-family units are permitted as a special exception, density shall not
exceed three (3) units per acre (or fractional equivalent thereof) of lot area.
10
2122.4 Uses. Uses permitted by right, by conditional use, and by special exception are provided in Division
IV of this article.
Section 2123 REDD-F2 District
2123.1 District Intent. The intent of the Redevelopment District Floating Zone 2 is to provide for higher
intensity development consistent with approved floating zoning district standards. Further, this district is
intended to accommodate imminent development on tracts of three acres or greater. Uses within this district
are prescribed by the article; however this district is intended to allow for design flexibility in setback,
height, density, and parking standards and to allow for cluster development. In addition, architectural
standards may be customized. This district is designed to encourage development that is compatible with
adjacent nonindustrial districts, integration with surrounding development, and provide for the coordination
of improvements outlined in the citys comprehensive plan and official map.
2123.2 Eligibility for Designation. Any property or combination of properties within the REDD-B or
REDD-F1 districts that is three acres or greater of contiguous area may be zoned as a Redevelopment
District Floating Zone 2 subject to conformity with the comprehensive plan and the requirements of this
Ordinance. A request to rezone a property to an REDD-F2 district may only be initiated by the owner(s)
of the property(s).
2123.3 REDD-F2 Dimensional and Density Standards. The following standards shall apply to properties
within the REDD-F2 district.
1. Minimum lot size. Each lot shall have a minimum area of four thousand (4,000) square feet.
2. Minimum lot width. Each lot shall have a minimum lot width of twenty five (25) feet.

11
2123.4 Uses. Uses that may be permitted by right, by conditional use, and by special exception are provided
in Division IV of this article. The REDD-F2s floating zone may further restrict allowable uses by requiring
a higher level of approval procedure but not a lower level approval procedure than is shown in Division IV,
Table 2142. Where uses are further restricted, the floating zone text shall specify those uses which are
allowed by right, conditional use, or special exception and provide conditions, if any, requisite to the
establishment of each use. A use which does not appear within Division IV, Table 2142 is an unlisted use
and is not permitted within an REDD-F2 floating zone.
Section 2124 REDD-F3 District
2124.1 District Intent. The intent of the Redevelopment District Floating Zone 3 is to provide for higher
intensity development consistent with approved floating zoning district standards. Unlike the REDD-F2,
this district is intended for larger developments and affords the greatest amount of flexibility in design and
permissibility of uses of any of the REDD districts. This district is designed to encourage large scale
development that can occur in phases and that incorporates the design principles and improvements of the
citys comprehensive plan and official map.
2124.2 Eligibility for Designation. Any property or combination of properties within the REDD-B, REDDF1,
or REDD-F2 districts that is ten (10) acres or greater of contiguous area may be zoned as a
Redevelopment District Floating Zone 3 subject to conformity with the comprehensive plan and the
requirements of this Ordinance. A request to rezone a property to an REDD-F3 district may only be initiated
by the owner(s) of the property(s).
2124.3 REDD-F3 Dimensional and Density Standards. The following standards shall apply to properties
within an REDD-F-3 floating zone.
1. Minimum lot size. The minimum lot size is established by the applicable district standards.
2. Minimum lot width. Each lot shall have a minimum lot width of twenty (20) feet.

The coverage for all building within the floating zone shall not exceed forty (40) percent of the
net development area.
4. Impervious coverage. The maximum impervious coverage for each lot is established by the
REDD-F3s district standards. Impervious coverage shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the
net development area.
5. Height limit. The maximum building and structure height is established by the approved district
standards.
6. Setbacks. The minimum setbacks are established by the approved district standards.
7. Open Area Required. No less than thirty five (35) percent of the net development area shall be
open area.
8. Open Space Required. No less than twenty five (25) percent of the net development area shall
be open space.

Section 1504 Powers
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following powers:

decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of the Zoning
Ordinance;
1504.2 To hear and decide appeals for variances from the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance
when strict application of the provisions of the Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship.
A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the Board make and
explains in writing the following findings:
1504.201 There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the
particular piece of property,
1504.202 These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity,
1504.203 Because of these conditions, the application of the Ordinance to the
particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably
restrict the utilization of the property,
1504.204 The authorization of the variance will not be of substantial detriment to
adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the district will
not be harmed by the granting of the variance, and
1504.205 The Board may not grant a variance the effect of which would be to extend
physically a nonconforming use of land, or to change the zoning district
boundaries shown on the Official Zoning Map. The fact that property may
be utilized more profitably, should a variance be granted may not be
considered grounds for a variance;
1504.3 To authorize the permitting of special exceptions subject to the terms and conditions for
such uses as set forth by this Ordinance. The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve, approve with
conditions, or deny a request for a special exception permit. Special exception permits may be
approved only if the board finds that the proposed use:
1504.301 Is in fact a use specifically listed as a special exception for the zoning district
in which the use is intended,
1504.302 Is consistent with the recommendations contained in the City of Georgetown
Comprehensive Plan and the character of the underlying zoning district as indicated in the
zoning districts intent,
1504.303 Is compatible with existing uses in the vicinity and will not adversely affect the
general welfare or character of the immediate community,
1504.304 Adequate provision is made for such items as setbacks, buffering, and screening
(including fences and/or landscaping) to protect adjacent properties from the possible
adverse influence of the proposed use such as noise, vibration, dust, glare, odor, traffic
conditions, and similar factors,
35
1504.305 When applicable, will be developed in a way that will preserve and incorporate
important natural features,
1504.306 Complies with all applicable rules, regulations, laws, and the standards of this
chapter, and
1504.307 Will not hinder or endanger vehicular traffic or pedestrian movements on
adjacent streets.
In granting a special exception permit, the board may attach to it such conditions regarding
the location, character, or other features of the proposed structure or use as the board may
consider advisable to protect established property values in the surrounding area or to
promote the public health, safety, or general welfare; and
1504.4 To remand a matter to the Zoning Administrator, upon motion by a party or the boards
own motion, if the board determines that the record is insufficient for review. A partys motion for
remand may be denied if the board determines that the record is sufficient for review. The board
must set a rehearing on the remanded matter without further public notice for a time certain within
sixty days unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The board must maintain a list of persons who
expressed an interest in being informed when the remanded matter is set for rehearing, and notice
of the rehearing must be mailed to these persons prior to the rehearing.
1504.5 In exercising the above powers, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, in conformity with the
provisions of this Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order,
requirements, decision, or determination of the Zoning Administrator and to that end shall have all
the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a
permit. The board, in the execution of the duties for which appointed, may subpoena witnesses
and in case of contempt may certify such fact to the circuit court having jurisdiction. All final
decisions and orders of the Board must be permanently filed in the office of the Board as a public
record. All findings of fact and conclusions of law must be delivered to the parties of interest by
certified mail.
