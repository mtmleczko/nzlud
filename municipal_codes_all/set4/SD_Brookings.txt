PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Brookings, South Dakota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2002 Code, as supplemented through February 2013, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of this Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Editor's note- Printed herein is the home rule Charter for the City of Brookings as adopted Nov. 5, 2002. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation.

Sec. 1.02. - Construction.

    The City may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its functions and may participate in the financing thereof, jointly or in cooperation, by contract or otherwise, with any one (1) or more states or any state division or agency, or the United States or any of its agencies or any township, county or municipality.

4.  Incur additional debt, 
unless and except to the extent otherwise authorized to any City established as a SDCL Title 9 authorized form of City government.

Sec. 2-63. - Conflicts of interest policy. 
(a)  Authority. The city council hereby adopts this section pursuant to Article VII of the Brookings City Charter. 
(b)  Purpose and declaration of policy. The primary purpose of this section is to ensure that the use of public office for private gain is prohibited. Moreover, this section is intended to ensure that the business of this municipality will be conducted in such a way that no public official of the municipality will gain a personal or financial advantage as a result of their position with the city and so that the public trust in municipal officials will be preserved. A further purpose of this section is to avoid the appearance of impropriety, whether or not an actual conflict of interest exists. This section applies to the mayor and council members, and to city officers, employees and members of all boards, commissions and committees of the city. 
(c)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
    Benefit means anything reasonably regarded as economic gain or economic advance, including benefit to any other person in whose welfare the beneficiary is interested, but does not include a contribution or expenditure made and reported in accordance with law.

In addition, a conflict of interest does not arise if the personal or financial interest is permitted by law, such as the exceptions to prohibited contracts set forth in SDCL 6-1-2.

    Officer, official, employee, board, committee or commission member are also referred to in this section as "public official" and "public officers" and include any person elected to, appointed to, or employed or retained by any public office or public body of the city, whether paid or unpaid and whether temporary, part-time, or full-time. Accordingly, the mayor, council members, employees, all board, committee and commission members are officers, employees and officials of the city. 
    Official act or action means any discretionary legislative, administrative or judicial act performed by any elected or appointed official, officer or employee while acting on behalf of the municipality. 
    Public body means the city and its departments, boards, city council, commissions, committees or other instrumentalities. 
    Public interest means an interest of the community as a whole, conferred generally upon all residents of the municipality. 
    Public officer means any person elected to, appointed to, or employed or retained by, any public office or public body of the city, whether paid or unpaid and whether temporary, part-time, or full-time.

(2)  The remaining members of the public body of which such public official is a member and the city manager shall have the authority to inquire of any public official about a possible conflict of interest and to suggest or recommend that the member recuse him or herself from the matter. If the member believes that he or she does not have a conflict of interest, the member shall, prior to participating in the matter, identify the matter under consideration, the nature of the potential conflict of interest and why he or she believes that he or she is able to act in the matter.

(b)  The granting of financial investment is determined to be a public purpose. Specifically, such investment protects the public welfare by promoting and fostering the growth of the city's economic base which in turn has positive effects by generating jobs, increasing the tax base, services and products produced by the private sector, encouraging and providing for the vitality of residential areas and of commercial and industrial businesses within the city, as well as providing increased opportunities for employment for the residents of the city and enabling the city to carry forward its functions in the preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and residents of the city, all of which have a net positive impact on city revenues, and, in general, improve the quality of life in the city. 
(c)  The city council specifically finds and determines that creation of the committed fund balance for retail economic development investments is consistent with the city's powers as a home rule municipal corporation and that exercise of said powers in the manner set forth herein is in furtherance of the public health, safety and welfare of the city. The city council finds, determines and declares that the ordinance from which this division derives is promulgated under the general police power of the City of Brookings, that it is promulgated for the health, safety and welfare of the public, and that the ordinance is necessary for the preservation of health and safety and for the protection of public convenience and welfare. The city council further determines that the ordinance bears a rational relation to the proper legislative object sought to be attained.

--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- The dedicated public art fund, as adopted by Ord. No. 16-005 on Feb. 9, 2016, shall be effective as of Jan. 1, 2017. 

Sec. 2-111. - Establishment. 
    There is hereby established a dedicated public art fund within and for the City of Brookings. A resolution providing for the advancement of a comprehensive public art appreciation and public displays program was adopted by the city council on December 15, 2015. This ordinance incorporates the objectives of that resolution and establishes, pursuant to that resolution, a dedicated public art fund, with procedures for the creation of the dedicated public art fund set forth herein. 
( Ord. No. 16-005 ,  I, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-112. - Findings. 
    The city council finds that public art and design enhances the environment of the City of Brookings, enriches the lives of its citizens and improves the value of the city's public spaces and buildings. In addition, the presence of public art encourages the careers of local professional artists and provides possible opportunities for their employment and career advancement. Moreover, it is the vision of the city council to support the creative class because a creative workforce is important for economic growth and a vibrant community. The council further finds that art can be more fully appreciated if it is publicly displayed as opposed to merely confined to the internal premises of galleries and museums. Finally, a dedicated funding source for an established program of public art enhances the reputation of the city and serves as a vehicle for attracting new businesses and talent to all sectors of the community. 
( Ord. No. 16-005 ,  I, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-113. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the dedicated public art fund is to provide funding for the design, purchase, acquisition, installation and maintenance of public art for the City of Brookings. 
( Ord. No. 16-005 ,  I, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-114. - Funding procedures. 
    The dedicated public art fund shall receive an annual appropriation of one percent of annual capital expenditures from each revenue fund which is within the city council's budgetary authority and which has an appropriation for capital expenditures. As part of the annual budget preparation process, the city manager shall provide for such appropriation commensurate with the budgeted capital expenditures, and may recommend that certain expenditures be exempt from the one percent calculation for justifiable reasons. Capital expenditures used for purposes of establishing the annual appropriation shall include equipment, infrastructure, construction projects and real estate that are either new acquisitions or replacements or enhancements of existing capital assets. 
( Ord. No. 16-005 ,  I, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-115. - Administration of the fund. 
    In accordance with Government Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 54 ("GASB 54"), the dedicated public art fund shall be reported as part of the general fund for financial reporting purposes, but shall be maintained individually for accounting purposes and budgetary comparisons. A Brookings Public Arts Commission, which is charged with the duty to recommend policies and guidelines for the advancement of public art throughout the community, shall also recommend to the city council proposed expenditures of the dedicated public art fund. The city council shall have final approval of all such policies, guidelines and proposed expenditures of the dedicated public art fund.

The provisions of this section do not apply to rooms or units in dwellings that contain living quarters for no more than two families living independently of each other, if the owner maintains and occupies one of the living quarters as his or her residence. 
a.  For the purposes of determining discrimination based on familial status, a family is one or more individuals under the age of 18 who are domiciled with their parent, legal custodian or person granted custody with permission of the parent or custodian. This definition includes a person who is pregnant or in the process of securing custody of a person under the age of 18.

If the building has elevators, all housing units and common areas shall be usable by disabled persons and persons in wheelchairs. The accommodations may include widened doors, lowered electrical switches and outlets, lowered environmental controls, grab bars or reinforcements, kitchens and bathrooms usable by the disabled.

d.  It is also be discriminatory to refuse to permit, at the expense of the disabled person, reasonable modifications of existing property that may be necessary to afford full enjoyment of the property. The landlord may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition permission for remodification on the renter's agreeing to restore the premises to the condition that existed prior to the modification at the conclusion of renter's tenancy, reasonable wear and tear excepted. 
(5)  For any person engaged in the provision of public accommodations, because of race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, to fail or refuse to provide to any person access to the use of and benefit from the services and facilities of those public accommodations; or to accord adverse, unlawful, or unequal treatment to any person with respect to the availability of the services and facilities, the price or other consideration therefor, the scope and quality thereof, or the terms and conditions under which such are made available, including terms and conditions relating to credit, payment, warranties, delivery, installation and repair; 
(6)  For any person engaged in the provision of public services, because of race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, to fail or refuse to provide to any person access to the use and benefit thereof, or the terms and conditions under which such are made available; 
(7)  For any person, because of race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, directly or indirectly, to conceal any unlawful discrimination; to aid, abet, compel, coerce, incite or induce another person to discriminate; or by any means, trick, artifice, advertisement or sign, to use any form of application, or make any record or inquiry, or device whatsoever to bring about or facilitate discrimination; or to engage in or threaten to engage in any reprisal, economic or otherwise, against any person because of the latter's filing a charge, testifying or assisting in the observance and support of the purposes and provisions of this chapter; 
(8)  For any person, bank, banking organization, mortgage company, insurance company or other financial institution or lender to whom application is made for financial assistance for the purchase, lease, acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, repair or maintenance of any real property or any agent or employee thereof to discriminate against any person or group of persons, because of the race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital status, gender identity, or sexual orientation of the person or group of persons or of the prospective occupants or tenants of the real property in the granting, withholding, extending, modifying, renewing or in the rates, terms, conditions and the extension of services in connection therewith; 
(9)  Wherever religious organizations or bodies are exempt from any of the provisions of this chapter, the exemption shall apply only to religious qualifications for employment or residence in church-owned or church-operated property, and the organizations shall not be exempt from any provisions of this chapter relating to discrimination based upon race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital status, gender identity, or sexual orientation;

a.  Employer; 
b.  Provider of public accommodations; 
c.  Provider of public services; 
d.  Person selling, renting, or leasing real property; 
e.  Person acting on behalf of any of the persons listed in subsections (11)a.-d., above, with or without compensation, including but not limited to any person licensed as a real estate broker or salesman, attorney, auctioneer, agent, or representative by power of attorney or appointment; and

    Full-service restaurant, any restaurant at which a waiter or waitress delivers food and drink offered from a printed food menu to patrons at tables, booths or the bar. Any restaurant that only serves fry orders or food such as sandwiches, hamburgers or salads is not a full-service restaurant; 
    Restaurant, any area in a building which is maintained, advertised and held out to the public as a place where individually priced meals are prepared and served primarily for consumption in such area and where not more than 40 percent of the gross revenue of the restaurant is derived from the sale of alcoholic beverages. The restaurant shall have a dining room or rooms, a kitchen and the number and kinds of employees necessary for the preparing, cooking and serving of meals. 
(b)  License application requirements: 
    Documentation: An applicant for a full-service restaurant on-sale license shall provide sufficient documentation to the municipality with an application form provided by the municipality to prove that the primary source of revenue from the operation of the restaurant will be derived from the sale of prepared food and nonalcoholic beverages and not from the sale of alcoholic beverages. The supporting documentation concerning the primary source of revenue submitted pursuant to this section is confidential. 
(c)  Annual reports: The full-service restaurant on-sale licensee shall submit an annual report and supporting documentation to the city on forms provided by the city of the annual sales of the full-service restaurant, which includes an oath verifying the validity of the information provided in the report. The report and the supporting documentation submitted pursuant to this section are confidential. The report shall contain the annual gross sales of the licensee for the following two categories: 
(1)  Food and nonalcoholic beverage sales; and 
(2)  Alcoholic beverages sales. 
(d)  License renewals: When renewing a full-service restaurant on-sale license, the city shall condition the license renewal upon receiving documentation that not more than 40 percent of gross sales from the preceding 12 months operation of the full-service restaurant is derived from the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
(e)  Only retail, on-sale service permitted: A full-service restaurant on-sale licensee may only serve alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption in the bar and dining room area of the restaurant. 
(f)  Smoking prohibited: No licensee that has a full-service restaurant on-sale license may allow smoking on the licensed premises. 
(g)  Full-service restaurant license fees: 
(1)  As required by state law, the license fee charged for a full-service restaurant on-sale license shall be at or above the current fair market value for such license as determined herein. However, any fair market value so established shall be a minimum of $1.00 for each person residing within the city as measured by the last preceding decennial federal census. 
(2)  The license fee shall be initially established by resolution within 90 days of the initial adoption of this section. Subsequent changes in the license fee shall not be made for a period of ten years from the effective date of adoption of this section unless a population growth reported by the federal decennial census requires an increase in the fee. 
(3)  Fair market value for full-service restaurant license shall be established as follows: 
a.  Within 90 days of the effective date of this article and as required by state statute, each licensee within the city who owns an on-sale license issued pursuant to SDCL 35-4-2 (4) or (6) as of January 1, 2008, and who purchased the license or had the license transferred to such licensee at anytime between January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2008, shall report the amount originally paid for the on-sale license to the city manager on forms provided by the city. Any form submitted pursuant to this provision shall be signed under oath and shall include the documents establishing the amount originally paid for the on-sale license. If the transaction for the purchase of the on-sale license included real or personal property, the full market value of the real or personal property on the date of the original sale shall be deducted from the total transaction price to determine the amount paid by the licensee for the on-sale license. The burden of establishing the amount paid for the license shall be on the licensee. Any licensee contesting the fair market value of the real or personal property may appeal the valuation adopted by the city to circuit court. 
b.  For purposes of this section, the term "current fair market value" means the documented price of the on-sale license most recently sold between January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2008, through an arm's length transaction, less the value of any real or personal property included within the transaction. 
c.  In the event it is determined that under SDCL Chapter 35-4, no on-sale license has been purchased or transferred because such licenses are not transferable in a local option community, but may only be subject to an operating agreement, then the license fee shall nonetheless be set at or above the minimum of $1.00 for each person residing within the city as measured by the last preceding decennial federal census. 
(h)  Registry of full-service restaurant on-sale licensees: The city shall maintain a registry of each full-service on-sale restaurant license that is being offered for sale and the city shall furnish a copy of the registry to anyone who requests a new-full service restaurant on-sale license. The existing full-service restaurant on-sale licensee is responsible for registering with the city that the full-service restaurant on-sale license is for sale. 
(i)  Issuance of new full-service restaurant licenses restricted: The city may only issue a new license pursuant to this section if no on-sale license is on the registry or a person desiring to purchase an on-sale license listed on the registry provides documentation showing that the person is unable to purchase the on-sale license at the price established in subsection (g) of this article and on terms satisfactory to both the potential buyer and seller. The price of any on-sale license registered as "for sale" with the city shall be sold at the current fair market price set by the city pursuant to a resolution adopted in accordance with subsection (g)(2) of this section.

(2)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(3)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4)  Variances may only be issued upon a determination that, considering the flood hazard, the variance is the minimum necessary variance to afford relief. 
(5)  Variances may only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights or additional threats to public safety, will not result in extraordinary public expenses, will not create a nuisance, cause damage to the public as identified in subsection (d) of this section or conflict with existing ordinances. 
(6)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted must be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

(10)  Require until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the city's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city. 
(11)  Require within zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(12)  Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (a)(6) be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and are securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(13)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of section 38-82, the city may approve certain development in zones A1-30, AE, and AH, on the city's FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the city first applies for a conditional FIRM revision, fulfills the requirements for such a revision as established under the provisions of section 65.12 of the current NFIP regulations (44 CFR parts 59-78), and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator. 
(14)  Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's FIRM either: 
(i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, 
(ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or

(c)  When the Federal Insurance Administrator provides notice of final base flood elevations within zones A1-30 and/or AE on the city's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated AO zones, AH zones, A99 zones, and A zones on the city's FIRM, and has provided data from which the city shall designate its regulatory floodway, the city shall: 
(1)  Meet the requirements of subsection (a)(1) through (14); 
(2)  Select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point; 
(3)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
(4)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of section 38-82, the city may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided the city first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of section 65.12 of the current NFIP regulations (44 CFR Parts 59-78) and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.

    Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The following standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility: 
(1)  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property must be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings shall not be undertaken. 
(4)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting that cause damage to historic materials must not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, must be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(8)  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction must not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
    State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). The South Dakota State Historical Society located in the South Dakota Department of Tourism. The office that has the responsibility for administering the state's historic preservation program as authorized by state law and conducted according to the guidelines of the United States Department of the Interior. 
    State Register of Historic Places. An official list, authorized by SDCL 1-19A-5, and prepared and maintained by the South Dakota Office of History. The list identifies the properties and areas that are significant to South Dakota's historical, architectural, archeological, and cultural landscape, and therefore should be protected and preserved.

Any variance granted by the planning commission shall be noted in its official minutes. 
(a)  Hardship. Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, it may, after written application by the developer, grant variances to the regulations subject to specified conditions so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Such variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations or the comprehensive plan. The planning commission shall not grant variances to these regulations unless they make findings based upon evidence presented to them in each specific case that: 
1.  Because of unusual surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were adhered to. 
2.  The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property and are not applicable, generally, to other property and have not been created by any person having an interest in the property. 
3.  The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire for financial gain. 
4.  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public's health, safety or welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(b)  Large scale residential developments. The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified by the planning commission in the case of a plan for a new residential neighborhood which, in the judgment of the planning commission, complies with the objectives of the comprehensive plan and section 94-341 of the zoning ordinance. 
(c)  Design innovations. From time to time subdivisions may be designed to provide unusual amenities and at the same time fail to conform strictly to the provisions of these regulations. The planning commission may waive certain requirements of these regulations in approving subdivisions involving detailed and workable design innovations that would yield an enhanced living environment for future occupants.

ARTICLE IX. - OFFENSES INVOLVING GRAFFITI 

Sec. 58-240. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city council is enacting this ordinance to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The city council is authorized to adopt this ordinance pursuant to its police powers, which authorize the city, under certain circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti from private and public property. 
    The city council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and is destructive to the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods may be affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. 
    The city council intends, through the adoption of this ordinance, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement. 
(Ord. No. 27-08,  I, 5-27-2008) 
Sec. 58-241. - Definitions. 
    Graffiti means any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, painting or other defacement that is written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of public or private property by any graffiti implement, to the extent that the graffiti was not authorized in advance by the owner or occupant of the property, or, despite advance authorization, is otherwise deemed a public nuisance by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 27-08,  I, 5-27-2008)

Sec. 58-243. - Graffiti as nuisance. 
(a)  The existence of graffiti on public or private property in violation of this article is expressly declared to be a public nuisance and, therefore, is subject to the removal and abatement provisions specified in this article as well as any other law which permits abatement of a public nuisance. 
(b)  It is the duty of both the owner of the property to which the graffiti has been applied and any person who may be in possession or who has the right to possess such property to at all times keep the property clear of graffiti.

    If graffiti is not removed by the perpetrator according to section 58-244, graffiti will be removed pursuant to the following provisions: 
(1)  Property owner responsibility. It is unlawful for any person who is the owner or who has primary responsibility for control of property or for repair or maintenance of property in the city to permit property that is defaced with graffiti to remain defaced for a period of ten days after service by the city of notice of the defacement. The notice shall contain the following information: 
a.  The street address or legal description of the property sufficient for identification of the property; 
b.  A statement that the property is a potential graffiti nuisance property with a concise description of the conditions leading to the finding; 
c.  A statement that the graffiti must be removed within ten days after receipt of the notice and that if the graffiti is not abated within that time the city may declare the property to be a public nuisance, subject to nuisance abatement; and 
d.  An information sheet identifying any graffiti removal assistance programs available through the city and private graffiti removal contractors. 
(2)  Exceptions to property owner responsibility. The removal requirements of subsection (1) above shall not apply if the property owner or responsible party can demonstrate that: 
a.  The property owner or responsible party lacks the financial ability to remove the defacing graffiti; or 
b.  The property owner or responsible party has an active program for the removal of graffiti and has scheduled the removal of the graffiti as part of that program, in which case it shall be unlawful to permit such property to remain defaced with graffiti for a period of 15 days after service by the city of notice of the defacement. 
(3)  Right of city to remove. 
a.  Use of public funds. Whenever the city becomes aware of graffiti or is notified and determines that graffiti is located on publicly or privately owned property viewable from a public place, the city shall be authorized to use public funds for the removal of the graffiti, or for the painting or repairing of the article affected by the graffiti, but shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive an area than that where the graffiti is located, unless the city manager or designee determines in writing that a more extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement to the area or neighborhood, or unless the property owner or responsible party agrees to pay for the costs of repainting or repairing the more extensive area. 
b.  Right of entry on private property. Prior to entering upon private property or property owned by a public entity other than the city for the purpose of graffiti removal, the city shall attempt to secure the consent of the property owner or responsible party and to obtain a release of the city from liability for property damage. If the property owner or responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time specified by this ordinance, or if the city has requested consent to remove or paint over the offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the city and consistent with the terms of this section, the city may commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal according to state law or city ordinances which provide further abatement procedures for public nuisances.

Examples of structural BMPs may include permanent detention or retention ponds constructed to control and minimize stormwater runoff rates and volumes and to prevent, control, and minimize stormwater pollution. Non-structural BMPs may include ongoing treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or water disposal, or drainage from raw materials storage. BMPs may also be temporary, such as BMPs put into place during construction and maintained until the site is permanently stabilized. 
    Clean Water Act (CWA) means the 1972 amendment to the Federal Pollution Control Act which provides the statutory basis for the NPDES permit program and the basic structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from point sources to waters of the United States. 
    Concrete washout means any wash waters derived from the cleaning of concrete trucks and/or equipment. 
    Control measures means any BMP or other method used to minimize erosion and sedimentation, and thereby minimize the discharge of pollutants to waters of the state.

    Drainage way means any channel or conduit that conveys stormwater runoff. 
    Final stabilization means one of the following: 
(1)  All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70 percent of the native cover for unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures has been established, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures (such as the use of gravel, riprap, gabions, geotextiles, etc.) have been employed; or 
(2)  When background native vegetation will cover less than 100 percent of the ground (e.g., arid areas, beaches), the 70 percent coverage criteria is adjusted as follows: if the native vegetation covers 50 percent of the ground, 70 percent of 50 percent (0.70  0.50 = 0.35) would require 35 percent total cover for final stabilization. On sites with no natural vegetation, no vegetative stabilization is required; or 
(3)  For construction projects on land used for agricultural purposes, final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its pre-construction agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not previously used for agricultural activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to waters of the state, and areas that are not being returned to their pre-construction agricultural use shall meet the final stabilization criteria in subsections (1) or (2) immediately above. 
    Flood means an overflow of surface water onto lands not normally covered by water.

(d)  Request for site study; calculation of runoff weighting factor by Table II. Upon written request from a property owner, a detailed site study will be conducted by the city engineering department to determine the runoff weighting factor. This written request must be submitted to the city engineer on or before April 30 of the year the fees are charged to the subject land parcel. Upon receipt of a written request, the engineering department will calculate the percentage of impervious area for the subject parcel which contributes stormwater runoff to the drainage system of the city. This system includes the storm sewer system, drainageways and all ditches and waterways within and flowing away from the city. The runoff weighting factor is then determined through utilization of Table II.

**These values are derived from the "STORM" equation (Figure 5-20, page 5-49), which is made a part hereof and is referred to as "A Statistical Method for the Assessment of Urban Storm Drainage," EPA, Washington, D.C., January 1979. For low percentage impervious surfaces (0 percent to 20 percent), a linear relationship is assumed between the "STORM" equation and empirical data derived from drainage runoff in high depression storage, loose soils and flat areas. Interpolation of the runoff weighting factor for a given percentage to impervious area not listed in Table II may be obtained by assuming a linear relationship between the values listed. The city engineer may direct that the runoff weighting factor for a given parcel be calculated by a detailed site investigation and the use of Table II, where an obvious departure from the percentage of impervious surfaces of similar land uses exists. A determination of the runoff weighting factor resulting from a detailed site investigation and use of Table II, brought about either by the written request of a property owner or by direction from the city, will be used in the calculation of the storm drainage fee of the subject parcel and will replace the factor previously derived from Table I, even if the resulting value is higher. 
(e)  Parcel area. The parcel area will be obtained from the records of the city engineer's office. 
(f)  Unit financial charge. The unit financial charge is established by resolution of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-18. - Collection. 
    The storm drainage fee established in section 72-17 shall be an annual charge. The first one-half of such fee is due on May 1 and the second one-half is due on November 1 of the same year, payable at the office of the county finance department and remitted to the city. 
    Refund procedure: Upon written request from a property owner, the city may issue a refund if the incorrect drainage fee has been charged to the property owner. The engineering department will calculate the drainage fee and determine the amount of any refund owed to the property owner. The maximum refund the city may issue is the fee for the current year and the preceding two years. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-19. - Fund established. 
    The drainage fees paid to the city shall be maintained in a separate fund to be known as the drainage and storm sewer fund. This fund shall be used to pay the cost of financing the operation, maintenance or construction of the drainage and storm sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-20. - Annual review. 
    The unit financial charge may be reviewed annually and revised as necessary so that revenues are reasonably in balance with anticipated expenditures. Excess funds may be carried forward from year to year in order to build sufficient funds for large drainage construction projects which are scheduled or programmed for the near future. In addition, funds may be carried over to provide sufficient monies for unanticipated repairs, replacements or maintenance of the drainage system.

(4)  Any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), provided the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the NPDES permit, waiver or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the municipal separate storm drain system. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-33. - Prohibition of illicit connections. 
(a)  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the municipal separate storm drain system is prohibited. 
(b)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under prior law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(c)  A person is in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-34. - Suspension of MS4 access due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. 
    The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-35. - Suspension of MS4 access due to the detection of illicit discharge. 
    Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. 
    A person commits a violation of this ordinance if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this article without the prior approval of the city. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-36. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city prior to allowing discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-37. - Monitoring and inspection of discharges. 
    This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial and construction activity. 
(1)  The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. 
(2)  The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary, in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency, to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(3)  The city has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter. 
(5)  If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged where there is probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the city, then the city or authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-38. - Requirements to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
    The city requires best management practices (BMP's) for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMP's to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, may constitute compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMP's shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-39. - Watercourse protection. 
    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee or tenant, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse located within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other obstacles that may pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-40. - Notification of spills. 
    In addition to other reporting requirements which may be required by applicable law, as soon as any person responsible for property or a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the U.S., the responsible person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, the responsible person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, the responsible person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the verbal notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-41. - Enforcement. 
    Whenever the city or state or federal authorized enforcement agency finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation: 
(1)  The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting; 
(2)  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
(3)  That violating discharges, practices or operations shall cease and desist; 
(4)  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
(5)  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and 
(6)  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
    If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that should the violator fail to remediate or restore the affected property by the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
    In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties and remedies authorized by this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-42. - Appeal of notice of violation. 
    Any person receiving a notice of violation from the city may appeal the determination. The notice of appeal must be received within five days from the date of the notice of violation. A hearing of the appeal will be held by the city manager or designee, and shall take place within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the city manager or designee shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-43. - Cost of abatement of the violation. 
    Within ten days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within five days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the city or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter is liable to the city for the cost of abatement as a result of such violation. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-44. - Injunctive relief. 
    It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision of this chapter or to fail to comply with any of its requirements. If a person violates or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the city may petition for abatement and for a preliminary and permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or to compel the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation. 
(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010) 
Sec. 72-45. - Remedies not exclusive.

Secs. 94-8-94-40. - Reserved 
ARTICLE II. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 94-41. - Nonconforming and nonstandard uses, buildings and structures. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming uses, buildings and structures, and to specify those circumstances under which they shall be permitted to continue. 
(b)  Scope of regulations. This chapter establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of those districts that those nonconforming uses, buildings and structures which substantially and adversely affect the orderly development or property value of other property in the district be either discontinued, reduced to conformity as soon as the fair interests of the parties will permit, or be permitted to continue with certain restrictions. 
(c)  Continuation of nonconforming use. Whenever a use, building or premises becomes a nonconforming use through a change in the zoning ordinance or district boundaries, such use may be continued although the use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter. The continuance of nonconforming uses, structures or land is subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  Expansion. A building containing a nonconforming use shall be allowed a 25 percent maximum expansion based on its gross floor area, excluding any basement. Such enlargement shall be permitted provided the yard, height, landscaping, parking and loading requirements of the zoning district in which it is located are complied with. 
Example computation: 
N = existing gross floor area in square feet 
N sq. ft.  .25 = maximum enlargement 
(2)  Reconstruction/restoration. 
a.  When the use of a building or structure is nonconforming and such a building or structure is destroyed by fire, explosion, or natural disaster, such building or structure must be reconstructed or restored in accordance with the applicable requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. For the purpose of this chapter, a structure shall be considered to be destroyed when the cost of restoration exceeds one-half the current assessed valuation of the building or structure prior to destruction. 
b.  When a building or structure is damaged but not destroyed by fire, explosion, or natural disaster, such building or structure may be repaired or reconstructed and may subsequently have the same or a more restrictive use. 
(3)  Change in use. A nonconforming use may not be changed except to a permitted use, permitted special use or conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located. A change to a permitted special use or conditional use is subject to all additional regulations and procedures as required by this chapter. 
(4)  Repairs and maintenance. 
a.  Ordinary repairs to a building or structure containing a nonconforming use shall be permitted provided that no structural alterations may be made in or to such building or structure except those required by law or to make the building or structure and use thereof conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
b.  For purposes of this chapter, "ordinary repairs" includes normal maintenance of a building or structure and other replacements of, or substitutions for, machinery or equipment. Ordinary repairs does not mean the replacement or restoration of foundations or structural elements. 
(d)  Discontinuance of nonconforming use. Nonconforming uses, structures and land are not permitted to continue if such use is discontinued for more than one year. The city council may adopt, after notice by certified mail to the property owner, an amortization schedule to bring about the gradual elimination of such nonconforming use. 
(e)  Nonconforming uses in general. In general, nonconforming uses shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  The existence of a nonconforming use on a part of a lot shall not be construed to establish a nonconforming use upon the entire lot. 
(2)  A nonconforming building or structure may be moved in whole or in part to another location on the lot as long as said building or structure would not be nonstandard as defined in this chapter after such move is completed. 
(3)  Accessory buildings and uses customarily incidental to the operation of the nonconforming use may be constructed on the property provided they are constructed according to all applicable codes and regulations and further provided that said construction does not exceed the 25 percent expansion allowed for enlargements of nonconforming uses in accordance with subsection (c)(1) of this section. 
(f)  Nonstandard uses. Nonstandard uses may be continued although such uses do not conform to the provisions of this chapter. Nonstandard structures and buildings may be enlarged, extended, reconstructed or altered if such changes comply with the yard, height and parking requirements for the district in which they are located. 
(g)  Effect on use which is illegal under prior law. Nothing in this chapter authorizes or permits the continuance of the use of a building, structure or premises in violation of zoning regulations in effect prior to the effective date of this chapter. Accordingly, the use shall have been lawfully established.

Sec. 94-164. - Brookings Regional Airport Overlay District. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to create an airport overlay district that considers safety issues around the Brookings Regional Airport, regulates and restricts the heights of constructed structures and objects of natural growth, creates appropriate zones, establishing the boundaries thereof and providing for changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such zones, creates the permitting process for uses within said zones and provides for enforcement, assessment of violation penalties, an appeals process, and judicial review. 
(b)  Relation to other zone districts. The Brookings Regional Airport Overlay District shall not modify the boundaries of any underlying zoning district. Where identified, the airport overlay district shall impose certain requirements on land use and construction in addition to those contained in the underlying zoning district. 
(c)  Definitions. The following words and phrases when used in this ordinance shall have the meaning given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
    Airport elevation: The highest point of an airport's useable landing area measured in feet above sea level. The airport elevation of the Brookings Regional Airport is 1,646 feet. 
    Airport hazard: Any structure or object, natural or manmade, or use of land which obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off at an airport. 
    Airport hazard area: Any area of land or water upon which an airport hazard might be established if not prevented as provided for in this ordinance. 
    Approach surface (zone): An imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. An approach surface is applied to each end of the runway based on the planned approach. The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface and expands uniformly depending on the planned approach. The approach surface zone is derived from the approach surface. 
    Conical surface (zone): An imaginary surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 feet horizontally to one foot vertically for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical surface zone is derived from the conical surface. 
    FAA: Federal Aviation Administration of the United States Department of Transportation. 
    Height: For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this ordinance and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified. 
    Horizontal surface (zone): An imaginary plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation that is constructed by swinging arcs of various radii from the center of the end of the primary surface and then connecting the adjacent arc by tangent lines. The radius of each arc is based on the planned approach. The horizontal surface zone is derived from the horizontal surface. 
    Nonconforming use: Any pre-existing structure, object of natural growth, or use of land which is inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance or an amendment thereto. 
    Non-precision instrument runway: A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only horizontal guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in non-precision instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned. 
    Obstruction: Any structure, growth, or other object, including a mobile object, which exceeds a limiting height set forth by this ordinance. 
    Other than utility runway: A runway that is constricted for and intended to be used by propeller driven aircraft of greater than 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight and jet powered aircraft. 
    Precision instrument runway: A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing an instrument landing system (ILS) or a precisions approach radar (PAR). It also means a runway for which a precision approach system is planned and is so indicated on an approved airport layout plan or any other planning document. 
    Primary surface: An imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the runway, extending 200 feet beyond the end of paved runways or ending at each end of turf runways. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
    Runway: A defined area of an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
    Runway protection zone (RPZ): A trapezoidal-shaped area centered about the extended runway centerline that is used to enhance the safety of aircraft operations. It begins 200 feet beyond the end of the runway or area usable for takeoff or landing. The dimensions of the zone are dependent upon the design aircraft, type of operation, and visibility minimums. The area of an RPZ is dimensioned at the ground elevation and extends vertically. 
    Structure: An object, including a mobile object, constructed or installed by man, including, but not limited to, buildings, towers, cranes, smokestacks, earth formations and overhead transmission lines. 
    Transitional surface (zone): An imaginary surface that extends outward and upward from the edge of the primary and approach surfaces to the horizontal surface at a slope of seven feet horizontally to one foot vertically (7:1). The transitional surface zone is derived from the transitional surface. 
    Tree: Any object of natural growth. 
    Utility runway: A runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by propeller driven aircraft of 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight or less. 
    Visual runway: A runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures. 
(d)  Establishment of runway protection zones. There are hereby created and established runway protection zones within the Brookings Regional Airport Overlay District, defined in subsection (c), and depicted on the Runway Protection Zones Map which is attached to this ordinance and made a part thereof. The dimensions of the runway protection zones are as follows: 
(1)  Runways 17 and 35: 
Length - 1,000' 
Inner width - 250' 
Outer width - 450'

Outer width - 1,010' 
(e)  Establishment of airport surface zones. In order to carry out the provisions of this ordinance, there are hereby created and established airport surface zones which include all the land lying beneath the approach, transitional, horizontal, and conical surfaces as they apply to the Brookings Regional Airport. Such zones are shown on the Isometric View of Imaginary Surfaces Map, which is attached to this ordinance and made a part thereof. Airspace located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitations. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Approach surface zone. 
a.  Runway 30-Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as 3/4 mile non-precision instrument approach surface zone. Established beneath the non-precision instrument approach surface. The inner edge of the zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. This approach surface slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface. 
b.  Runways 17 and 35-Utility runway visual approach surface zone. Established beneath the visual approach surface. The inner edge of this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. This approach surface slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface. 
c.  Runway 12-Precision instrument runway approach surface zone. Established beneath the precision instrument approach surface. The inner edge of this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. This approach surface slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface. 
(2)  Transitional surface zone. Established beneath the transitional surfaces adjacent to each runway and approach surface as indicated on the Isometric View of Imaginary Surfaces Map. 
(3)  Horizontal surface zone. Established beneath the horizontal surface, which is 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of the zone is constructed by swinging arcs of a specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal surface zone does not include the approach surface and transitional surface zones. When a 5,000 foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent 10,000 foot arcs, the 5,000 foot arc shall be disregarded in the construction of the perimeter of the zone. The horizontal surface zone location is depicted on the Isometric View of Imaginary Surfaces Map. The radius of the arc at each end of the runway is as follows: 
Runways 12 and 30 - 10,000' 
Runways 17 and 35 - 5,000' 
(4)  Conical surface zone. Established beneath the conical surface. This zone commences at the periphery of the horizontal surface and extends outward for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical surface zone is depicted on the Isometric View of Imaginary Surfaces Map. 
(f)  Establishment of use restrictions and height limitations. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, no use shall be made of land or water within the Brookings Regional Airport Overlay District in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the Brookings Regional Airport. Uses within the following zones are permitted as follows: 
(1)  Runway protection zone (RPZ). Areas within the RPZ shall contain no buildings or temporary structures, aboveground utility lines and cables, other similar land use structural hazards, or uses that create, attract, or bring together an assembly of persons thereon. 
a.  Permitted uses. 
1.  Seasonal crops. 
(2)  Imaginary surface zones. Subject at all times to the regulations of the underlying zoning district, no use shall be established and no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any approach, transitional, horizontal, or conical surface zone created by this ordinance to a height that would penetrate the surface elevation herein established for such zone and depicted on the Isometric View of Imaginary Surfaces Map. 
(g)  Permit applications. Any person who plans to erect a new structure, to add to an existing structure, or to erect and maintain any object (natural or manmade), in the vicinity of the airport, shall first notify the City of Brookings. All applications must comply with chapter 22, article VII, construction or alteration of objects that may affect navigable airspace, of the Municipal Code. No permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the height of an existing structure. 
(h)  Variance. Any request for a variance shall include documentation in compliance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 77 Subpart B (FAA Form 7460-I as amended or replaced). Determinations of whether to grant a variance will depend on the determinations made by the FAA and the City of Brookings as to the effect of the proposal in the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable air space. In particular, the request for a variance shall consider which of the following categories the FAA has placed the proposed construction in: 
(1)  No objection. The subject construction is determined not to exceed obstruction standards and marking/lighting is not required to mitigate a potential hazard. Under this determination a variance shall be granted. 
(2)  Conditional determination. The proposed construction/alteration is determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport hazard area which can be effectively mitigated. Under this determination, a variance shall be granted contingent upon implementation of mitigating measures as described in subsection (j): Obstruction marking and lighting. 
(3)  Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A variance shall be denied and the reasons for this determination shall be outlined to the applicant. 
    Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this ordinance. 
(i)  Pre-existing nonconforming uses. The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this ordinance, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. No nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to grow higher, so as to increase the nonconformity, and a nonconforming use, once substantially abated (subject to the underlying zoning ordinance,) may only be reestablished consistent with the provisions herein. 
(j)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance may be conditioned according to the process described in subsection (h) to require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate, and maintain such marking or lighting as deemed necessary to assure both ground and air safety. 
(k)  Violations and penalties. Section 94-6 of this chapter shall govern all violations of the provisions of this ordinance. 
(l)  Appeals. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter or of any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto. 
(m)  Conflicting regulations. Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations prescribed in this ordinance and any other regulation applicable to the same area, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail. 
(n)  Severability. If any of the provisions of this ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstance are held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the ordinance which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end, the provisions of this ordinance are declared to be severable.

    The regulations set forth in this section supplement the district regulations appearing elsewhere in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 21-03, 8-26-2003) 
Sec. 94-362. - Home occupations. 
(a)  Permit required; permit objective. The City of Brookings recognizes the need for some citizens to use their place of residence for limited nonresidential activities. However, the city believes that the need to protect the integrity of its residential districts is the primary concern. A zoning and use registration permit and a conditional use permit are the methods used to allow and regulate nonresidential activity within a residential district. The objective of these permits is to allow a limited commercial type activity in a residential district only to an extent that either neighbors or passersby will not be aware of the activity by any outward appearance or may be aware of the occupation because of the existence of a sign or additional traffic. It is therefore necessary to categorize home occupations as minor home occupations and major home occupations. 
(b)  Minor home occupation. A minor home occupation shall be allowed upon a premises provided the occupation complies with the following:

The city shall issue a written decision concerning the application within 60 days of submission of the initial application unless (a) the city notified the applicant that its application was incomplete within 30 days of filing. If so, the remaining time from the 60-day total review time is suspended until the applicant provides the missing information, (b) extension of time is agreed to by the applicant, or (c) additional time required by processes of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the state historic preservation office or the historic preservation commission, if applicable to the proposed installation, and to the extent that the same are beyond the control of the city. The running of the aforementioned 60-day period shall not otherwise be tolled. 
2.  Failure to issue a written decision within 60 days shall constitute an approval of the application. 
3.  The provisions of this subsection (c) do not apply to applications for facilities outside of the public rights-of-way in the municipality. 
(5)  Development standards. 
a.  Location and setback. 
1.  Antenna: Antenna(s) that are attached to support structures are exempt from the setback requirements in the district in which they are located. The antenna(s) may extend up to five feet horizontally beyond the edge of the support structure provided it does not encroach over the property line. 
2.  Telecommunication towers: A telecommunication tower shall meet the setback requirements for the district in which it is located. A telecommunication tower shall also be constructed on a lot so that it is as far away as possible from existing off-site buildings, and in no event nearer to any residential building than a distance of 100 percent of the height of the tower. A telecommunications tower shall not be closer to a residential district boundary line than 100 percent of its height. Where telecommunication towers are required to meet FAA paint and/or lighting regulations, the distance between them shall not be less than one-half mile. 
3.  Equipment facilities: All equipment facilities shall meet the setback requirements for the district in which they are located. 
4.  Amateur radio operator tower: All amateur radio operator towers shall meet the setback requirements for the district in which they are located.

Sec. 94-472. - Computation of area and height. 
    The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height: 
(1)  Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
(2)  Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. 
(3)  Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade is defined as the lower of: 
a.  The existing grade prior to construction. 
b.  The newly established grade after construction. 
(Ord. No. 21-03, 8-26-2003) 
Sec. 94-473. - Tables. 
    Signs shall be allowed on private property in accordance with Table 1. If the letter "P" appears for a sign type in a column, such sign is allowed without prior permit approval in the zoning districts represented by that column. If the letter "S" appears for a sign type in a column, such sign is allowed only with prior permit approval in the zoning districts represented by that column. Special conditions may apply in some cases. If the letter "N" appears for a sign type in a column, such a sign is not allowed in the zoning districts represented by that column under any circumstances. A sign designated by a "P" or "S" may be allowed only if it conforms to all other applicable requirements of this chapter.
