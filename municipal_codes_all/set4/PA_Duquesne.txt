§ 302. Zoning District Map and Boundaries.
A. Boundaries Established.
1. The boundaries of the various zoning districts are hereby established on the map entitled
"Official Zoning Map" on file in the office of the Zoning Officer. This map with all
explanatory matter thereon is hereby made part of this Chapter. The Official Zoning Map
shall be dated and signed by the City Clerk certifying that it is the true map adopted by
City Council. All amendments shall be identified on the map and similarly certified.
2. The boundaries between districts are, unless otherwise indicated, either the centerline of
streets or such lines extended, or parallel lines thereto, or property lines or other physical
boundaries and delineations. Where streets, property lines, or other physical boundaries
and delineations are not applicable, boundaries shall be determined by the scale shown on
the Official Zoning Map.
City of Duquesne
27-34
B. Interpretation. Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance
with those shown on the Official Zoning Map or in other circumstances not specifically
covered above, the Zoning Hearing Board shall interpret the district boundaries.
C. Future Street Vacation. In the event that a street, alley or other way shown on the Zoning
District Map is vacated, the property formerly in said street right-of-way shall be included
within the zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of said vacated street or
way. Where said street forms a zoning district boundary, the new district boundary shall be
the new property line created by the former centerline of said vacated street.
§ 303. Statement of Purpose for Zoning Districts.
A. R-1 Single-Family District. This district designates neighborhoods that typically contain
single-family dwellings built on moderately sized lots. Other residentially related uses are
also conditionally permitted, subject to certain compatibility standards.
B. R-2 General Residential District. This district includes established neighborhoods which
offer a variety of housing types. Special housing types, such as personal care homes, are
conditionally permitted in this district along with other residentially related uses, subject to
certain criteria.
C. C-1 Central Business District. This district encompasses the City's main business district and
provides for a wide variety of retail and service commercial uses along with business,
professional and governmental offices and other related business uses. Residential uses are
also permitted, consistent with the established character of this district.
D. C-2 Planned Commercial District. This district designates suitable areas in the City, usually
abutting major thoroughfares, where larger shopping centers and similar planned commercial
complexes may be located.
E. C-3 General Commercial District. This district denotes areas along major roadways that are
suitable for the development of highway oriented businesses which require convenient
automobile and/or truck access and off-street parking and loading. Site design standards
include provisions to avoid traffic congestion and assure that these areas will blend
attractively with adjoining residential and business areas.
F. M-1 General Manufacturing District. This district provides for a wide range of
manufacturing and other industrial uses including rail, truck, public and other transportation
services.
G. OZO Opportunity Zone Overlay. This overlay zone relates to portions of the R-1 and R-2
districts and permits a selection of appropriately scaled commercial and light industrial land
uses and requires appropriately scaled buffer yards to separate the light industrial from
residential uses. This overlay encourages development that does not currently exist within the
area.
H. LWO Live-Work Overlay. This overlay zone’s intent is to promote the redevelopment of
Article III – Schedule of District Regulations
Zoning
27-35
Second Street, as a corridor where on-premises business enterprises and residential living can
occur simultaneously. Addressing this need is a reflection of a recommendation from the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of the Cities of Duquesne and McKeesport.
I. CCD City Center Development District. This overlay zone encompasses the site of the
former U.S. Steel Duquesne Works. The long range objective is to redevelop this area into a
compatible mix of manufacturing, light industrial, railroad and related uses so that it will
once again be a major economic generator for the City and surrounding region. Standards for
this district, in conjunction with those contained in the City's Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance [Chapter 22], encourage creative and high quality site planning and
design while minimizing adverse environmental impacts. They also encourage recognition of
the site's riverfront and improved public access to the riverfront for leisure-time activities.
§ 304. District Regulations.
A. Authorized Uses. Except as provided by law or this Chapter, in each district a building,
structure or lot shall be used or occupied only for the purposes specified in Table 300-1,

A. Authority. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear a request for a variance where it is alleged
that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the Applicant. The
Zoning Hearing Board may rule prescribe the form of application and may require
preliminary application to the zoning officer.
B. Standards. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance only if the Applicant
demonstrates and the Zoning Hearing Board finds:
1. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions including irregularity,
narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship
is due to such conditions and not to be circumstances generally created by the provisions
of this Chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
2. That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this Chapter; and
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
3. That such unnecessary hardship had not been created by the appellant.
4. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
5. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance which will afford
relief and represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
C. Planning Commission Comments. The Zoning Hearing Board shall request the review and
comments of the Planning Commission on any variance application, which shall be made part
of the public record.
D. Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board may attach to any variance such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this
Chapter.

requirement of this Chapter by more than fifteen (15) percent.
2. Permit an increase in the otherwise allowable area of the sign by more than ten (10)
percent.

maintained, under state regulations.
“Existing uses” are those attained as of November, 1975, regardless whether they have been
designated in Chapter 93. Land development must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all
streams, and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical characteristics of surface water
bodies. After land development these characteristics can be impacted by addition of
pollutants such as sediment, and changes in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or
rates. Therefore, discharges to surface waters must be designed and managed to protect the

C. Performance Standards.
1. General. The following shall be considered the overriding performance standards
against which all proposed stormwater control measures shall be evaluated:
a. Any Applicant engaged in the alteration or development of land which may affect
stormwater runoff characteristics shall implement such measures as are
reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety or other property. Such
measures shall include such actions as are required:
1) To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no greater after
development than prior to development activities.
2) To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting stormwater runoff
in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health and property from
possible injury.
2. Watershed Standards.
a. If the proposed development is located in a watershed for which a stormwater
management plan has been approved in accordance with the Monongahela River
Watershed Plan, then stormwater runoff shall be handled in accordance with the
standards and criteria contained in the Watershed Plan.
b. If the proposed development is located in a watershed for which a Stateapproved
stormwater management plan is not yet completed, then stormwater management
facilities for the site shall control peak stormwater discharge for a range of design
storms from the two (2) to one hundred (100) year storm. The Applicant's
City of Duquesne
22-60
engineer in consultation with the City Engineer shall determine the design storms
which shall be used, based on the capacity of existing obstructions and system
components. Type II Rainfall Distribution shall be used for analyzing runoff in
pre- and post- development conditions as well as for designing runoff control
facilities (except collection and conveyance systems).
D. Runoff Calculations.
1. For the purpose of computing peak flow rates and runoff hydrographs from
development sites and drainage areas larger than one (1) acre, calculations shall be
performed using the methodologies presented in SCS publication, Technical Release
55 (TR 55). For development sites less than one (1) acre, the Rational Method shall
be utilized.
2. For the purposes of designing storm sewers, open swales and other runoff collection
and conveyance facilities, the Rational Method shall be applied. Rainfall intensities
for design should be obtained from the PennDOT rainfall charts, as per Appendix A
of Chapter 7 of the 2015 PennDOT Drainage Manual, as amended.
E. Stormwater Detention Facilities.
1. When detention facilities are utilized, the facility(s) shall be designed such that postdevelopment
peak runoff rates from the developed site are controlled to those rates
which shall be shown to prevent downstream harm under selected design storms.
2. All detention facilities shall be designed and equipped to safely pass the postdevelopment
one hundred (100) year storm runoff flows without damaging (i.e.,
impairing the continued function of) the facilities.
3. Facilities which provide detention of runoff for more than one (1) development site
may be considered. Such facilities shall meet the criteria contained in this Section. In
addition, runoff from the development sites involved shall be conveyed to the facility
in a manner that avoid adverse impacts (such as flooding or erosion) to channels and
properties located between the development site and the shared-storage facilities.
4. The use of lakes, ponds, ballfields or similar recreational areas to serve as detention
facilities is encouraged wherever feasible, subject to approval of the City.
5. Other considerations which should be incorporated into the design of the detention
facilities include:
a. Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and installed to prevent erosion,
and bottoms of impoundment type structures should be protected from soil
erosion.
b. Control and removal of debris both in storage structures and all inlet or outlet
devices shall be a design consideration.
Article VI – General Design Principles
Subdivision and Land Development
22-61
c. Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations and other structures shall be
protected and designed to minimize safety hazards.
d. The water depth of a storage pond shall be limited to that which is safe for
children. Otherwise, appropriately landscaped fencing at least six (6) feet in
height shall be required.

other open or closed channels, shall be designed in accordance with the Pennsylvania
Uniform Construction Code and the following basic standards:
a. All sites shall be graded to provide drainage away from and around the structure
in order to prevent any potential flooding damage.
b. Lots located on the high side of streets shall extend roof and french drains to the
curb line storm sewer (if applicable). Low side lots shall extend roof and french
drains to a stormwater collection/conveyance system or natural watercourse in
accordance with the approved stormwater management plan for the development
site.
c. Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel and close to the
top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid the possibility failing or causing
the embankment to fail.
d. All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey the twenty-five
(25) year storm peak flow rate from the contributing drainage area and to carry it
to the nearest suitable outlet such as a curbed street, storm sewer or natural
watercourse.
e. Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall be suitably lined to
prevent erosion and designed to avoid excessive velocities.
2. Wherever utilized, storm sewers shall comply with the Pennsylvania Uniform
Construction Code and the following:
a. Where practical, designed to traverse under seeded and planted areas. If
constructed within ten (10) feet of road paving, walks or other surfaced areas,
City of Duquesne

accounts in such lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for the
purposes of this section.
D. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or federal or
commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the financial
City of Duquesne
22-74
security, provided said bonding company or lending institution is authorized to conduct
such business within the Commonwealth.
E. Such bond or other security shall provide for and secure to the public the completion of
any improvements which may be required on or before the date fixed in the formal action
of approval or accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements.
F. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the required
improvements shall be equal to one hundred (100) percent of the cost of completion
estimated as of ninety (90) days following the date scheduled for completion by the
Applicant. Annually, the City of Duquesne may adjust the amount of the financial
security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have been completed
and the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the ninety (90) day after either the original date scheduled for completion or
a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the City of Duquesne
may require the Applicant to post additional security in order to ensure that the financial
security equals said one hundred ten (110) percent. Any additional security shall be
posted by the Applicant in accordance with this section.
G. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of
completion of the required improvements, submitted by the Applicant and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and certified by such
engineer to be fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The City of Duquesne, upon the
recommendation of the City Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause
shown. If the Applicant and the City of Duquesne are unable to agree upon an estimate,
then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer
licensed as such in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the City of Duquesne and
the Applicant. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen,
fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the City of Duquesne and
the Applicant.
H. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one (1) year from the date of
posting of the financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount of
financial security may be increased by an additional ten (10) percent for each one (1) year
period beyond the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an
amount not exceeding one hundred ten (110) percent of the cost of completing the
required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one
(1) year period using the above bidding procedure.
I. In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the City Council may
authorize submission of final plats by sections or stages of development subject to such
requirements or guarantees as to improvement in future sections or stages of development
as it finds essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the development.
J. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the
financial security may request the City Council to release or authorize the release, from
Article VII – Required Improvements
Subdivision and Land Development
22-75
time to time, of such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing
addressed to the City Council and the City Council shall have forty-five (45) days from
receipt of such request within which to allow the City Engineer to certify, in writing, to
the City Council that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been
completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon such certification, the City
Council shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an
amount as estimated by the City Engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed or, if the City Council fails to act within said forty-five (45) day
period, the City Council shall be deemed to have approved the release of funds as
requested. The City Council may, prior to final release at the time of completion and
certification by its engineer, require retention of ten (10) percent of the estimated cost of
the aforesaid improvements.
K. Where the City Council accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements
following completion, the City Council may require the posting of financial security to
secure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final
plat for a term not to exceed eighteen (18) months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in this
section with regard to installation of such improvements and the amount of the financial
security shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements.
L. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or facilities related
thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations
of a public utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from the City of Duquesne,
financial security to ensure proper completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in
accordance with the regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority
and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise required by this
section.
M. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of improvements
required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as set forth in this section, the City
of Duquesne shall not condition the issuance of building, grading or other permits
relating to the erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots
or land as depicted upon the final plat upon actual completion of the improvements
depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said financial security has been
provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall not be
withheld following the improvement of the streets providing access to and from public
roads to such building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon the
approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in question if such
improvements are necessary for the reasonable use or occupancy of the building or
buildings. Any ordinance or statute inconsistent herewith is hereby expressly repealed.

§ 713. Release from improvement bond.
A. When the Applicant has completed all of the necessary and appropriate improvements,
the Applicant shall notify the City Council, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of
the completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the City
Engineer. The City Council shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, direct
and authorize the City Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The City
Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report in writing with the City Council and shall
promptly mail a copy of the same to the Applicant by certified or registered mail. The
report shall be made and mailed within thirty (30) days after receipt by the City Engineer
of the aforesaid authorization from the City Council; said report shall be detailed and
shall indicate approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and
if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall be rejected by the City Engineer, said
report shall contain a statement of reasons for such non-approval or rejection.
B. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Engineer's report, the City Council shall notify
the Applicant, in writing by certified or registered mail, of the action of the City of
Duquesne with relation thereto.
C. If the City Council or the City Engineer fails to comply with the time limitation
provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to have been approved and
the Applicant shall be released from all liability, pursuant to its performance guarantee
bond or other security agreement.
D. If any portion of the said improvement shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the
City Council, the Applicant shall proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the
same procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed. Such completion
shall satisfactorily meet the City of Duquesne's statement of reasons for non-approval or
rejection.
E. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the Applicant's right to
contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise, any determination of the City
Council or the City Engineer.
F. Where herein reference is made to the City Engineer, he shall be as a consultant thereto.
G. The Applicant shall reimburse the City of Duquesne for the reasonable and necessary
expense incurred for the inspection of improvements according to a schedule of fees
adopted by resolution of the City of Duquesne and as from time to time amended. Such
expense shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees
charged by the City Engineer or consultant for work performed for similar services in the
community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the engineer
or consultant to the City of Duquesne when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed
on the Applicant.
1. In the event the Applicant disputes the amount of any such expense in connection
with the inspection or improvements, the Applicant shall, within ten (10) working
Article VII – Required Improvements
Subdivision and Land Development
22-77
days of the date of billing, notify the City of Duquesne that such expenses are
disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case, the City of Duquesne shall
not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development application or any
approval or permit related to development due to the Applicant's request over
disputed engineer expenses.
2. If, within twenty (20) days from the date of billing, the City of Duquesne and the
Applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are reasonable and
necessary, then the Applicant and the City of Duquesne shall jointly, by mutual
agreement, appoint another professional engineer licensed as such in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to review the said expenses and make a
determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable and necessary.
3. The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence and review such
documentation as the professional engineer in his or her sole opinion deems necessary
and render a decision within fifty (50) days of the billing date. The Applicant shall be
required to pay the entire amount determined in the decision immediately.
4. In the event that the City of Duquesne and Applicant cannot agree upon the
professional engineer to be appointed within twenty (20) days of the billing date,
then, upon application of either party, the Court of Common Pleas shall appoint such
engineer, who, in that case, shall be neither the City Engineer nor any professional
engineer who has been retained by, or performed services for, the City of Duquesne
or the Applicant within the preceding five (5) years.
5. The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining the reasonable and
necessary expenses shall be paid by the Applicant if the amount of payment required
in the decision is equal to or greater than the original bill. If the amount of payment
required in the decision is less than the original bill by $1,000 or more, the City of
Duquesne shall pay the fee of the professional engineer, but otherwise the City of
Duquesne and the Applicant shall each pay one-half (1/2) of the fee of the appointed
professional engineer.
§ 714. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
In the event that improvements which may be required have not been installed as provided in this
Chapter or in accord with the approved final plat, the City Council are hereby granted the power
to enforce any corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and equitable means. If the
proceeds of such bond or other security are sufficient to pay the cost of installing or making
repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said security, the City Council may, at
its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development
and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary to
complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the
security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the Applicant, or both, shall be
used solely for the installation of the improvements covered by such security and not for any
other City of Duquesne purpose.
City of Duquesne
