PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of the City of Seneca of a general and permanent nature, and is the first codification since 1960. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. This Code was subsequently republished in 1996. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixteenth section of Chapter 4 is 4-16. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 6-4 and 6-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-4.1, 6-4.2 and 6-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof, as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and James S. Vaught, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. H. Jerry Balding, City Administrator, Mr. John W. Fields, City Attorney, and Ms. Barbara J. B. Whitney, Municipal Clerk and Treasurer, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
    The city authorized the republication of this Code in May 1995, and this volume is issued as a replacement copy to replace all existing copies of the Code as published in 1983 and supplemented through Supplement Number 4. 
    This republication was under the supervision of Lori A.S. Hood, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, and credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff who provided assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Walter R. Smith, City Clerk-Treasurer, for his participation, cooperation and interest during the preparation of this republication of the Code.

    The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted. 
Sec. 1-8. - Parenthetical and reference matter.

(b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code. Such amendments may be in the following language: "That section ____________ of the Code of Ordinances, City of Seneca, South Carolina, is hereby amended to read as follows:..." The new provisions may then be set out in full as desired. 
(c)  In the event a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language may be used: "That the Code of Ordinances, City of Seneca, South Carolina, is hereby amended by adding a section, to be numbered ____________ , which section shall read as follows:..." The new section may then be set out in full as desired. 
(d)  All sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed shall be specifically repealed by section, article or chapter number, as the case may be. 
Sec. 1-11. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, when necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-12. - Unauthorized alteration or tampering with Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. 
Sec. 1-13. - Police power extended to city property. 
    The police power of the city is hereby extended to include, as well as land within the city, all lands or property outside the city owned or leased by the city or any agency of the city and the general ordinances of the city shall be applicable on such property.

(b)  Opening. Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices. 
(c)  Tabulation. A tabulation of all bids received shall be available for public inspection. 
(d)  Rejection of bids. The city shall have the authority to reject all bids, parts of all bids, or all bids for any one or more supplies or contractual services included in the proposed contract, when the public interest will be served thereby. 
(e)  Bidders in default to the city. The city shall not accept the bid of a vendor or contractor who is delinquent in the payment of taxes, license or other moneys due the city. 
(f)  Award of contract. 
(1)  Reserved. 
(2)  Lowest responsible bidder. Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. In determining "lowest responsible bidder," in addition to price, the city shall consider: 
a.  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
b.  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
c.  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the bidder; 
d.  The quality or performance of previous contracts or services; 
e.  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or services; 
f.  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service; 
g.  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or contractual services to the particular use required; 
h.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract; 
i.  The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid. 
(g)  Award to other than low bidder. When the award is not given to the lowest bidder, a full and complete statement of the reasons for placing the order elsewhere shall be prepared by the city and filed with the papers relating to the transaction and held for a period of no less than twelve (12) months. 
(h)  Tie bids; local vendors. If all bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, the contract shall be awarded to the local bidder. If two (2) or more of such bids are submitted by local bidders, the city shall award the contract to one of the local tie bidders by drawing lots in public. If local bidders are not involved in the tie bids, the city shall award the contract to one of the outside tie bidders by drawing lots in public. The city, local bidders, and vendors should bear in mind, however, that to award a contract to a local vendor where he is not the lowest responsible bidder, or where price, quality and service are not equal, is to give preference to one minute segment of the citizenry against the best interest of the community as a whole. 
(i)  Performance bonds. The city shall have the authority to require a performance bond, before entering into a contract, in such form and amount as he shall find reasonably necessary to protect the best interest of the city. 
(j)  Payment bond/labor and material bond. The city may require a payment bond and a labor and material bond, before entering into a contract, in such form and amount as he/she shall deem necessary to protect the best interest of the city.

(a)  Notice. Upon the adoption of this article and the certification of the city by the FCC, the city shall immediately notify all cable operators in the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992. 
(b)  Cable operator response. Within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the city, a cable operator shall file with the city its current rates for basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates. 
(c)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the city council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operators rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark, the city council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rates within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city. 
(2)  If the city council takes no action within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic rates with the city, the proposed rates will continue in effect. 
(d)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the city council is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city council shall, within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety (90) days if the city council needs more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or 
b.  One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark. 
(2)  If the city council has not made a decision within the ninety- or one hundred fifty-day period, the city council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the proposed rate, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(f)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed initial basic rate may submit the objection in writing any time before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city clerk with the objector's name and address. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the city council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rates on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten (10) percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number occurring between September 30, 1992 and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic cable rate above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The city council will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates minus ten (10) percent, [the city council] will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the city council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following: 
a.  If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the city council shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or 
b.  If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the city council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the city council determines that the initial basic cable rates [that] are submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the city council may order the rates reduced in accordance with paragraph (g) or (h), as applicable. In addition, the city council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city council's decision resolution. 
(3)  Statement of reasons for decisions and public notice.

(a)  Notice. A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the city and notify all subscribers at least thirty (30) days before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of the initial basic cable rates. 
(b)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the city council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the city council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rate within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city. 
(2)  If the city council takes no action within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go into effect. 
(c)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the city council is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety (90) days if the city council needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and 
b.  One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap. 
(2)  The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period. 
(3)  If the city council has not made a decision within the ninety- or one hundred fifty-day period, the city council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(d)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before action on the requested rate increase, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections.

(f)  Delayed determination. If the city council is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the city council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price gap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the city council shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the city council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the city council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The city council's decision concerning the requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted. 
(j)  Refunds. 
(1)  The city council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments with interest if:

(k)  Appeal. The city council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 93-24, § 3, 12-14-93) 
Sec. 7.5-24. - Cable operator information. 
(a)  City may require. 
(1)  In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the city council may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the city council may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting information to the city council may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection shall not be considered. 
(c)  City council action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b) will be acted upon by the city council. The city council will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a preponderance of the evidence a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from the public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the city council denies the request, the city council shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the city return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the city council, the information will be made available for public inspection.

Sec. 7.5-25. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. The factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the city at least thirty (30) days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The city shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the city makes no objection within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect. 
(Ord. No. 93-24, § 5, 12-14-93) 
Sec. 7.5-26. - Enforcement.

Sec. 10.5-21. - Declaration of purpose and intent. 
    The city and Seneca Light and Water understands the fundamental need to make efficient use of the limited and valuable water resource under its stewardship in order to protect the public's health and safety and environmental integrity. The purpose of this article is to establish a plan and procedures for managing water demand and evaluating supply options before and during a drought-related water shortage. The intent is to satisfy the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000 (Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1976, Section 49-23-10, et seq., as amended) with the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from domestic water use, sanitation, and fire protection and to provide water for other purposes in an equitable manner. Therefore, the city and Seneca Light and Water has adopted this Drought Management Plan and Drought Response Ordinance that provide the policies and the authority to fulfill this obligation. The Drought Management Plan outlines the framework by which the city and Seneca Light and Water will internally prepare for water shortages. The article provides the regulations by which the city and Seneca Light and Water will manage and control its customer water usage during various levels of a drought. 
(Ord. No. 2003-13, Exh. A, 5-13-2003) 
Sec. 10.5-22. - Definition of terms.

(Ord. No. 2003-13, Exh. A, 5-13-2003) 
Sec. 10.5-23. - Drought management plan. 
(a)  Introduction: To ensure that the city and Seneca Light and Water adequately manages its water system during drought-related conditions, an organized plan is necessary for system operation and reliability, proper communications, effective coordination and ultimate allocation of water use. Prior planning will compliment the city and Seneca Light and Water's ability to respond to drought conditions and to enforce the related article. 
(b)  Designation of water system drought response representative: Administrating a drought plan requires the skills needed to undertake a comprehensive public information program and the judgement required to deal with equity issues arising from enforcement of a mandatory program. Someone who has these skills will be selected by the water system to manage the water system's program and serve as the principal contact for the news media as the water system's drought response representative. 
    The drought response representative for the city and Seneca Light and Water is: 
Director of utilities, Robert W. Faires, III. 
Address: 250 E.N. 2 nd Street; Seneca, SC 29679. 
Phone: 864-885-2716 
Email: rwf3@seneca.sc.us 
(c)  Description of water system layout, water sources, capacities and yields: The city and Seneca Light and Water is located in the West or Savannah Drought Response Management Area of South Carolina. The system serves the City of Seneca, Keowee Key, Salem, Pioneer Water District and surrounding areas in Oconee County. The water supply source to the system is Lake Keowee. The SCDHEC total permitted capacity of the water system operated by Seneca Light and Water is twelve million (12,000,000) gallons per day. Ground storage capacity at the plant site is approximately four million (4,000,000) gallons. Off site elevated storage is approximately one million five hundred seventy0five thousand (1,575,000) gallons. Three (3) main transmission lines carry water from the plant; two (2) lines are twenty-four (24) inches diameter and another at sixteen (16) inches. 
(d)  Identification of water system specific drought or water shortage indicators: Operators of every water system must develop historical trends that are valuable indicators of a system's ability to meet demand when demand begins to outpace supply. Seneca Light and Water has developed triggers for use during drought or demand water shortages that describe when specific phases of the drought response ordinance are implemented. The system triggers are as follows: 
Moderate drought phase 
(1)  Storage falls below thirty-five (35) percentage of capacity. 
(2)  Average daily use greater than twelve (12) mgd for two (2) consecutive days. 
Severe drought phase 
(1)  Reservoir at fifteen (15) feet below full. 
(2)  Storage falls below thirty-five (35) percentage of capacity. 
(3)  Average daily use greater than twelve (12) mgd for two (2) consecutive days. 
Extreme drought phase 
(1)  Reservoir at twenty (20) feet below full. 
(2)  Storage falls below thirty-five (35) percentage of capacity. 
(3)  Average daily use greater than twelve (12) mgd for two (2) consecutive days. 
(e)  Cooperative agreements and alternative water supply sources: Successful drought management requires a comprehensive program by the water utility. In many situations administrative agreements are required with other agencies to fully implement the plan. Agreements with other water purveyors may be necessary for alternative water supply sources. Other agreements that strengthen conservation efforts by large users may be necessary. The city and Seneca Light and Water has agreements that are in place with the City of Westminster, SC and the City of Walhalla, SC to facilitate the implementation of this plan. However, because of the size of systems, these agreements were developed primarily to aid the aforementioned cities. There are presently no agreements that are being negotiated or considered with other entities. 
(f)  Description of pre-drought planning efforts: Before the occurrence of a water supply shortage and the need to implement the emergency provisions of the article, it is important that certain pre-response measures be taken with the aim of conserving the system's source water, as well as the water distributed to the customer. In regards to the conservation measures listed below, the city and Seneca Light and Water have taken the following actions: 
(1)  Identification of all major water users of the system: Pioneer Water District, Keowee Key, Engelhard, J P Stevens, Oconee Memorial Hospital, Town of Salem, Kendall Co., Cryovac, Metromont, Amoco, Hamilton Career Center, Lila Doyle, Wal-Mart, Seneca High School, Ryan's, Borg Warner, Zupan Concrete, Parkway Products. 
(2)  There are presently no users who have a conservation agreement. 
(3)  A vigorous public education program is critical for achieving substantial water use reductions. An effective public outreach program will keep the public informed about the water supply situation, what actions will mitigate drought emergency problems, and how well the public is doing in terms of meeting the program goals. Keeping the public involved, informed, and participating in the decision-making process is key to implementing an effective drought management plan. Drought condition information is conveyed to the public by means of public radio, newspaper, television, and utility bills. Water plant personnel conduct site visits and school classroom presentations. Information is also conveyed to the public about water usage through the annual Consumer Confidence Report which is mailed to all of Seneca Light and Water's customers. 
(g)  Description of capital planning and investment for system reliability and demand forecasting: Water utilities routinely find that capital improvements to the system strongly enhance their ability to get through times of drought. It is important that every water utility aggressively plan and build for future needs. The utility must continue to provide for system operation flexibility, improved pumping and storage capacity and new technologies to meet the demands of tomorrow. Describe the utility's capital improvement program and how past efforts have enhanced your system's ability to meet demand during drought conditions: Presently the water plant is beginning an expansion project to increase capacity from twelve (12) mgd to fourteen (14) mgd. Concurrently, two (2) elevated storage tanks with a storage capacity of one million (1,000,000) gallons each are being considered for installation in 2004. 
(Ord. No. 2003-13, Exh. A, 5-13-2003) 
Sec. 10.5-24. - Drought response ordinance. 
(a)  Declaration of policy and authority: The objective of this drought response ordinance is to establish authority, policy and procedure by which the city and Seneca Light and Water will take the proper actions to manage water demand during a drought-related shortage. The ordinance satisfies the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000 and has the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use, sanitation, and fire protection and of allocating water for other purposes in an equitable manner. 
    This article outlines the actions to be taken for the conservation of water supplied by the city and Seneca Light and Water. These actions are directed both towards an overall reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply. 
    To satisfy these goals, the city and Seneca Light and Water hereby adopts the following regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water. This article is hereby declared necessary for the protection of public health, safety and welfare and shall take effect upon its adoption by the city and Seneca Light and Water. 
    If it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to drought, the city and Seneca Light and Water is authorized to issue a proclamation (a "Proclamation") that existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual water-use demands. The Proclamation is an attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent that water-use for human consumption, sanitation, fire protection, and other essential needs becomes endangered. 
    Immediately upon issuance of such a proclamation, regulations and restrictions set forth under this article shall become effective and remain in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the Proclamation rescinded. 
    Water uses that are regulated or prohibited under this article are considered to be non-essential and continuation of such uses during times of water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water, subjecting the offender(s) to penalties. 
    The drought management plan as outlined in sections 10.5-21 through 10.5-24 is hereby approved. 
(b)  Moderate drought phase: Upon notification by the drought response committee that a moderate drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or upon determination by the city and Seneca Light and Water that a moderate water supply shortage exists based on trigger levels, the city and Seneca Light and Water will seek voluntary reductions from its customers in the use of water for all purposes and voluntary reductions on using water during certain peak water demand periods. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of twenty (20) percent in residential water use and fifteen (15) percent in other water uses such as commercial, industrial, institutional and irrigation; and a reduction in overall water use of fifteen (15) percent. To accomplish this, the city and Seneca Light and Water will take the following actions: 
(1)  Issue a proclamation to be released to local media, the city and Seneca Light and Water's customers and to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center that moderate drought conditions are present. 
(2)  Provide written notification to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the service area of the water system the voluntary conservation measures that the customers are requested to follow during Moderate drought conditions, including: 
a.  Reduce residential water use to sixty-five (65) gallons per person per day and a maximum of two hundred (200) gallons per household per day; 
b.  Eliminate the washing down of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, tennis courts and other hard surfaced areas; 
c.  Eliminate the washing down of buildings for purposes other than immediate fire protection; 
d.  Eliminate the flushing of gutters; 
e.  Eliminate the domestic washing of motorbikes, boats, cars, etc.; 
f.  Eliminate the use of water to maintain fountains, reflection ponds and decorative water bodies for aesthetic or scenic purposes, except where necessary to support aquatic life; 
g.  Reduce watering of lawns, plants, trees, gardens, shrubbery and flora on private or public property to the minimum necessary. Encourage outdoor watering to be done during off-peak hours. 
h.  Reduce the amount of water obtained from fire hydrants for construction purposes, fire drills or for any purpose other than fire-fighting or flushing necessary to maintain water quality; and 
i.  Limit normal water use by commercial and individual customers including, but not limited to, the following:

(7)  Provide written notification monthly to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center regarding the success of the voluntary and mandatory restrictions. 
(d)  Extreme drought phase: Upon notification by the drought response committee that an extreme drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or upon determination by the city and Seneca Light and Water that an extreme water supply shortage exists based on the trigger levels, the city and Seneca Light and Water will impose mandatory restrictions in the use of water for all purposes and on the times when certain water usage is allowed. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of thirty (30) percent in residential water use, twenty-five (25) percent in all other categories of water uses and a reduction in overall water use of twenty-five (25) percent. To accomplish these goals, the city of Seneca and Seneca Light and Water will take the following actions: 
(1)  Issue a Proclamation to be released to the local media, the city and Seneca Light and Water customers and to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center that extreme drought conditions are present; 
(2)  Provide written notification to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the service area of the water system the mandatory restrictions to be placed on the use of water supplied by the utility, including: 
a.  Limiting residential water use to fifty-five (55) gallons per person per day and a maximum of two hundred twenty-five (225) gallons per household or REU per day. 
b.  Eliminate landscape irrigation by the utility's customers. 
c.  Mandatory restrictions on the use of water supplied by the utility for activities including: 
1.  Eliminate the washing down of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, tennis courts and other hard surfaced areas; 
2.  Eliminate the washing down of buildings for purposes other than immediate fire protection; 
3.  Eliminate the flushing of gutters; 
4.  No domestic washing of motorbikes, boats, cars, etc.; 
5.  Eliminate the use of water to maintain fountains, reflection ponds, and decorative water bodies for aesthetic or scenic purposes, except where necessary to support aquatic life; 
6.  Eliminate filling or maintaining public or private swimming pools; 
7.  Eliminate obtaining water from fire hydrants for construction purposes, fire drills, or any purpose other than firefighting or flushing necessary to maintain water quality; and 
d.  Limit normal water use by commercial and individual customers including, but not limited to, the following: 
1.  Stop serving water in addition to another beverage routinely in restaurants; 
2.  Stop maintaining water levels in scenic and recreational ponds and lakes, except for the minimum amount required to support fish and wildlife; 
3.  Limit irrigating golf courses and any portion of their grounds; 
4.  Cease water service to customers who have been given a ten-day notice to repair one or more leaks and have failed to do so; and 
5.  Limit expanding commercial nursery facilities, placing new irrigated agricultural land in production, or planting or landscaping when required by site design review process. 
(3)  Intensify maintenance efforts to identify and correct water leaks in the distribution system. 
(4)  Continue to cease installation of new irrigation taps on the water system. 
(5)  Outline other conservation measures, examples are: 
a.  Place a moratorium on the issuance of all new water service connections and contracts for all new water main extensions. As part of the public information process, provide notice to developers of the moratorium; 
b.  Encourage all residential water customers to voluntarily reduce overall monthly water usage to seventy (70) percent of the customer's monthly average. If voluntary reduction of usage is not successful, the city and Seneca Light and Water may, at its option, implement the following excessive use rate schedule for water: 
Tier I 0 - 225 gallons/REU regular rate Tier II 226 - 400 gallons/REU Two (2) times regular rate Tier III Over 400 gallons/REU Three (3) times regular rate  
c.  Impose a drought surcharge per thousand gallons of water that increases with higher usage. The general principle behind the drought surcharge is that the fee is imposed on water use in excess of seventy (70) percent of normal monthly use. The drought surcharge is a temporary fee imposed during the current water supply shortage and is not a cost-based rate. The drought surcharge is temporary and will be terminated at such time as the city and Seneca Light and Water determines the water supply is above the trigger levels. 
d.  If the conservation measures of the article or plan prove inadequate to mitigate the effects of the drought conditions or water supply availability, the city and Seneca Light and Water may take additional actions including, but not limited to: 
1.  Decreasing the gallon/REU limits in the different tiers; and 
2.  Reduction of water system pressure as needed. 
(6)  Publicize widely the penalties to be imposed for violations of mandatory restrictions and the procedures to be followed if a variance in the restrictions is requested. 
(7)  Expand the use of education and public relations efforts as conducted under the moderate and severe drought phase and emphasize the penalties associated with violating the mandatory restrictions. 
(8)  Provide written notification monthly to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center regarding the success of the mandatory restrictions. 
(e)  Rationing. If a drought threatens the protection of public health and safety, the city and Seneca Light and Water is hereby authorized to ration water. 
(f)  Enforcement of restrictions. If any customer of the city and Seneca Light and Water fails to comply with the mandatory water use restrictions of this article, the customer shall be given a written notice of such failure to comply, which cites the date of said violation, and shall be assessed surcharges in accordance with the following schedule: 
First violation-Fifty dollars ($50.00) surcharge shall be added to the customer's water bill; 
Second violation-An additional one hundred dollars ($100.00) surcharge shall be added to the customer's water bill; 
Third violation-The customer's water service shall be terminated and restored only after payment of a surcharge of two hundred dollars ($200.00) in addition to all previously assessed surcharges. 
    Law enforcement agencies and other authorized agencies or designated employees in the respective jurisdiction which is being supplied water by the city and Seneca Light and Water shall diligently enforce the provisions of the Drought Response Ordinance. 
(g)  Variances.

Secs. 10.5-33-10.5-60. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

Sec. 10.5-61. - General provisions. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in SC Code of Laws, Title 5 and Title 6 and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Seneca, South Carolina does ordain as follows: 
(b)  Findings of fact. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Statement of purpose and objectives. It is the purpose of this article to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the article prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    The objectives of this article are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of the article are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this article is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
    Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs. 
(d)  Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study, dated September 11, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data, which are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study for the unincorporated areas of Oconee County, with accompanying map and other data, and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared part of this article. 
(e)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(f)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(g)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(h)  Partial invalidity and severability. If any part of this article is declared invalid, the remainder of the article shall not be affected and shall remain in force. 
(i)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(j)  Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more that five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days, or both. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent City of Seneca from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(Ord. No. 2003-18, Art. III, 7-15-2003; Ord. No. 2004-01, 7-8-2003; Amd. of 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 10.5-64. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
(a)  General standards. Development may not occur in the floodplain where alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures cannot be located out of the floodplain and that encroachments onto the floodplain are minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure; 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; 
(4)  Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This requirement does not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses, etc., as long as cut off devices and back flow devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to the building; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(8)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure which is in compliance with the provisions of this article, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this article. This includes post-FIRM development and structures. 
(9)  Non-conforming buildings or uses. Non-conforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this article. Provided, however, nothing in this article shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this article. 
(10)  American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in subsection (b) below, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in subsection 10.5-61(d) or subsection 10.5-63(c)(10), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one and one-half (11/2) feet above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with subsection (5) below. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one and one-half (11/2) feet above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with subsection (5) below. No basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in subsections 10.5-63(b)(7) and (9). A variance may be considered for wet floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in subsection 10.5-65(d). Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of subsection 10.5-65(d) must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this article. Structures which are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The maintenance plan must be approved by the local administrator and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to same. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or sub-division, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one and a half (11/2) feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (a) above, must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one and a half (11/2) feet above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance with Section 19-425.39 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, effective date May 25, 1990, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis at least thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the sight, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height an engineering certification is required. 
d.  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator. 
(4)  Recreational vehicles. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the requirements of subsection 10.5-63(b) and subsections (a) and (b)(3) above. 
(5)  Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and 
4.  Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building. 
b.  Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five (5) feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized. 
c.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
d.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except to enclose a single storage area and must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required, and cannot be temperature controlled. One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in subsections (b)(1), (2) and (3). 
e.  All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in subsections (b)(1), (2) and (3) shall be of flood resistant materials. 
(6)  Temporary development. Certain types of structures (e.g. fruit stands, construction site offices, portable toilets, etc.) may be situated temporarily on flood-prone property without having to comply with the elevation or floodproofing criteria of subsections (b)(1) and (2), respectively, provided that the following criteria are met: 
a.  All applicants must submit to the local administrator, prior to the issuance of the development permit, a written plan for the removal of any temporary structures or development in the event of a hurricane or flash flood warning notification. The plan shall be reviewed and approved in writing, and must include the following information: 
1.  A specified time period for which the temporary use will be permitted; 
2.  The name, address and phone number of the individual responsible for the removal of temporary structures or development; 
3.  The time frame prior to the event at which any structures will be removed (i.e. minimum of seventy-two (72) hours before landfall of a hurricane or immediately upon flood warning notification); 
4.  A copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with a trucking company to insure the availability of removal equipment when needed; 
5.  Designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside the floodplain to which any temporary structure will be moved; 
6.  A determination of permanent structures which would be adversely affected by increased flooding upstream or downstream, and a method for covering this liability, such as a performance bond; and 
7.  A plan to restore the area to its natural condition once the temporary permit expires or the temporary use is terminated, whichever is first. 
b.  The structure is mobile, or can be made so, and is capable of being removed from the site with a maximum of four (4) hours warning. 
c.  The structure will not remain on the property for more than one hundred eighty (180) days. 
(7)  Accessory structures. An accessory structure or garage, the cost of which is greater than three thousand dollars ($3000.00), must comply with the elevated structure requirements of subsections (b)(2) and (5). When accessory structures of three thousand dollars ($3000.00) or less are to be placed in the floodplain, the following criteria shall be met: 
a.  Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation (including work, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas); 
b.  Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential; 
c.  Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters; 
d.  Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure; 
e.  Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be installed in accordance with subsection (a)(4); and 
f.  Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be provided below base flood elevation in conformance with subsection (b)(5). 
(8)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 10.5-61(c), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local administrator. 
b.  If subsection a. above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 10.5-64. 
c.  Stream crossings for any purpose (i.e.., timber harvesting operations), if temporary, shall be permitted in accordance with subsection (b)(6) above. Otherwise, the development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 10.5-64. 
d.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection (b)(3) are met. 
e.  Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-rise certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations. 
(9)  Fill. Fill is discouraged because storage capacity is removed from floodplains. Elevating buildings by other methods must be considered. An applicant shall demonstrate that fill is the only alternative to raising the building to at least one and a half (11/2) feet above the base flood elevation, and that the amount of fill used will not affect the flood storage capacity or adversely affect adjacent properties. The following provisions shall apply to all fill placed in the special flood hazard area: 
a.  Fill may not be placed in the floodway unless it is in accordance with subsection (b)(8)a.; 
b.  Fill may not be placed in tidal or nontidal wetlands without the required state and federal permits; 
c.  Fill must consist of soil and rock materials only. Dredged material may be used as fill only upon certification of suitability by a registered professional geotechnical engineer. Landfills, rubble fills, dumps, and sanitary fills are not permitted in the floodplain; 
d.  Fill used to support structures must comply with ASTM Standard D-698, and its suitability to support structures certified by a registered, professional engineer; 
e.  Fill slopes shall be no greater than two (2) horizontal to one vertical. Flatter slopes may be required where velocities may result in erosion; and 
f.  The use of fill shall not increase flooding or cause drainage problems on neighboring properties. 
(c)  Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 10.5-61(d), are small streams where no base flood data has been provided or where no floodways have been identified. The following provisions apply within such areas: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within one hundred (100) feet of the stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered, professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (c)(1) is satisfied and base flood elevation data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions of section 10.5-64 and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established in accordance with subsection 10.5-63(c)(10). Data from preliminary, draft, and final flood insurance studies constitutes best available data. If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used. When base flood elevation data is not available from a federal, state, or other source, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(d)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and are subject to all applicable standards in these regulations. 
(2)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development which is greater than the lesser of five (5) lots or five (5) acres. Development of detailed floodway data will be required should the applicant wish to appeal the setbacks requirements of subsection (c)(1) above. 
(e)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 10.5-61(d), are areas designated as shallow flooding. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade; or 
b.  Be completely floodproofed together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(Ord. No. 2003-18, Art. IV, 7-15-2003; Amd. of 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 10.5-65. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  Establishment of appeal board. The construction maintenance and aesthetic board of adjustment and appeals as established by the city shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Right to appeal. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the court. 
(c)  Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair of rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(d)  Agricultural structures. Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure in accordance with Technical Bulletin 7-93, Wet Floodproofing Requirements for Structures Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Program, document number FIA-TB-7, dated 12/93, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In order to minimize flood damages during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure must meet all of the conditions and considerations of subsection (h)(4) below, and the following standards: 
(1)  Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed below: 
a.  Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for the storage of farm machinery and equipment; 
b.  Steel grain bins and steel frame corn cribs; 
c.  General purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock which are open on at least one side; 
d.  For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be issued for structures which were substantially damaged. New construction or substantial improvement of such structures must meet the elevation requirements of subsection 10.5-64(b)(2); and 
e.  Detached garages and storage sheds solely used for parking and limited storage in connection with agricultural uses only, which are no greater than four hundred (400) square feet in area. 
(2)  The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an existing building which is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials for the exterior and interior building components and elements below the base flood elevation; 
(3)  The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood velocities exceed five (5) feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls; 
(4)  The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of subsection 10.5-64(b)(5)a.; 
(5)  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure which is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions. The structure must comply with subsection 10.5-64(a)(4); 
(6)  The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of subsection 10.5-64(b)(8); and 
(7)  Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain in accordance with the temporary development provisions of subsection 10.5-64(b)(6). 
(e)  Considerations. In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(9)  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and 
(10)  Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available. 
(f)  Findings. Findings listed above shall be submitted to the appeal board, in writing, and included in the application for a variance. Additionally, comments from the department of natural resources, land resources and conservation districts division, state coordinator's office, must be taken into account and included in the permit file. 
(g)  Floodways. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(h)  Conditions. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. The following conditions shall apply to all variances: 
(1)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this article. Violations must be corrected in accordance with subsection 10.5-63(d)(5).

Editor's note- Ordinance No. 94-16, adopted Nov. 8, 1994, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, codification of §§ I, II and IV of said ordinance as §§ 23-101-23-103 herein was at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 23-101. - Purpose, definition and determination of subdivision. 
(a)  The purpose of this division is to establish a policy for the acceptance by the city of streets and roads in subdivisions located within the boundaries of the city. Recognizing the need for the cooperation of developers of real property, in order to encourage an orderly growth of the population of the city, and to encourage the acquisition by its citizens of dwellings and other places of residence, it is the purpose of this division and the policy of the city to regulate streets, roads and highways located in such subdivisions, to insure reasonable access to dwellings built along such streets, roads and highways, not only by the owners of the dwellings themselves but of other members of the traveling public. 
(b)  For purposes of this division, a subdivision shall be defined as a piece of property divided by the owner into two (2) or more separate parcels restricted for residential use with the intent and purpose of selling same for profit. 
(c)  The office of planning and community development shall be the designated authority for determining whether an area is a subdivision within the meaning of this division. In all cases wherein it has been determined by the assessor's office that an area is a subdivision, the burden of proving otherwise shall be upon the landowner or person claiming the contrary. 
(Ord. No. 94-16, § I, 11-8-94) 
Sec. 23-102. - Procedure. 
(a)  No street or road in any subdivision shall be accepted by the city for maintenance and incorporated within the city road system, unless the same be shown and delineated upon a plat of survey duly recorded as a subdivision in the office of the clerk of court for the county. 
(b)  A construction plan with sufficient detail, to include a cross section of proposed roadway, shall be furnished to the public works department and the planning and community development department prior to commencement of construction of any subdivision roadway and no construction shall commence until such plan is approved by the supervisor or his designated agent. 
(c)  No street, road or highway shall be accepted by the city for maintenance and incorporated into the city, unless the right(s)-of-way for the same is at least fifty (50) feet excepting further additional width may be required as to toe of cut and fill or beyond to include access easements for purposes of maintaining drainage ditches and pipe culverts. 
(d)  All dead-end roads shall contain a cul-de-sac (turnaround) of not less than one hundred (100) feet in diameter and shall be so documented on plat. 
(e)  No road, street or highway in any subdivision in the city shall be accepted by the city for maintenance and incorporation into the city road system unless the developer or owner of such subdivision shall tender to the city a deed to the right-of-way of such street, road or highway. The right-of-way tendered to the city shall contain a permanent easement for all water runoff from the road right-of-way as deemed necessary by the city. It will be the responsibility of the owner-developer to acquire easements for water runoff from private landowners. Upon acceptance of such deed or right-of-way, the owner thereof shall be notified in writing of the fact of such acceptance, and the same writing shall constitute an agreement on the part of the county to maintain and incorporate said road into its systems. 
(f)  No road, street or highway may be accepted for maintenance by the city and incorporated into its city road system unless the following conditions are met and exist at the time of the tender of the deed of conveyance from the owner or developer of such property, to-wit: 
(1)  All conditions of this division shall be satisfied and met. 
(2)  Clearing and grubbing. Clearing and grubbing shall consist of removal of all debris from roadway, including removal of all brush and stumps, and shall be removed from the entire right-of-way. All unstable material, stumps and debris shall be removed before an embankment is started. 
(3)  Unclassified excavation. This shall consist of removal of all debris and unsuitable material before the cut excavation is placed in the fills. All suitable material shall be placed in the embankment for the formation, compaction and shaping of all embankments, subgrades, shoulders, slopes, intersections, approaches and private entrances to conform to the typical cross section shown. Compaction in six-inch layers shall begin at zero with a minimum of ninety-five (95) percent through finished grade. A compaction test by a certified inspector shall be conducted and a copy of these results [shall be] furnished [to] the city prior to setup. Also a compaction test shall be conducted after roadway has been setup for surface treatment and a copy of test [shall be] furnished to the city. Compaction on setup shall be ninety-five (95) percent to one hundred (100) percent to include areas disturbed for placement of utilities. No grade [is] to exceed twelve (12) percent. Upon completion of road, all fills shall be protected by either seeding or riprap. Shoulders and other disturbed soil along the entire cleared right-of-way shall be seeded in a manner to ensure uniform sod. All fill of 21/2 to 1 slope or steeper shall be protected by riprap. 
(4)  Embankments. When embankment is to be on a hillside or against an existing embankment sloping more than twenty (20) degrees from the horizontal, the slope of the hillside or existing embankment shall be plowed deeply or cut into steps before filling is commenced. All embankments shall be formed by placing and spreading the material in successive, uniform, horizontal layers of not more than six (6) inches in depth for the full width of the cross sections and shall be kept level by the use of blade graders, bulldozers or other approved equipment. Embankment over and around pipes, culverts, arches and bridges or other structure shall be of selected materials placed and tamped thoroughly. 
(5)  Pipe culverts. Alternate #1 R.C. pipe culverts shall be of reinforced concrete. Pipe shall conform to the requirements of the AASHO M 170 Class 3 pipe. (Am. Assn. of State High. Official) 
Alternate #2 corrugated metal pipe shall meet requirements of AASHO M 36. 
All pipe culverts shall be of sufficient size to adequately insure proper drainage as determined by the Federal Soil and Conservation Service. Riprap is required to high water mark around the inlet end of all pipe culverts. 
In the event the water shed is of such a size that causes it to be necessary to install a bridge rather than a pipe culvert, then such bridge and installation shall conform to current state highway department specifications for steel reinforced concrete bridges of at least twenty-four (24) feet in width. Such bridges shall be of such elevation as to be approved by the Federal Soil and Conservation Service. 
(6)  All drainage inlets and outlets must include a permanent easement to include right by city to use adjacent property to obtain equipment access to inlets and outlets when inlets and outlets are not accessible from road right-of-way in order to allow for maintenance work to be performed on drainage inlets and outlets. For high water or flash flood conditions, city will not be responsible for any damage off the right-of-way. 
(7)  Macadam base course. Shall consist of crushed gravel aggregates, "type #2," placed upon the roadway not less than four (4) inches compacted. Suitable equipment must be used to get the required compaction. 
(8)  The city shall not accept any street or road for further maintenance within a subdivision until or unless the road is surface treated of such width and in the manner using such materials as approved by the public works director. The public works director shall furnish specification requirements upon request. The public works director shall be notified prior to any construction beginning, as well as during intervals or phases of the construction and approval of each phase is required before commencement of next construction phase. 
As a general rule the first date for surface treating a roadway for acceptance into the city road system is March 15, but this shall be determined, based upon weather conditions, annually by the public works director and the last date for surface treating a roadway with tar and gravel for acceptance into the city road system is September 15 and the last date for surface treating a roadway for acceptance into the city road system with hot mix is October 15; any variance to these dates must be approved in writing by the public works director. 
(9)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the owner-developer may cause the same to be paved by an independent contractor and, in such case, the owner shall be fully responsible to such paving contractor for the work performed by the contractor on said roads. Recognizing that from time to time the city may subcontract paving work to private firms, business or individuals, the subdivider-developer may, upon application to the mayor, be included in a general contract covering the roads in the particular subdivision as well as other paving projects, but in such an event the paving contractor shall look to the owner-developer for payment of all work performed in the subdivision. Upon paving according to the terms and conditions of this division, the city will undertake to accept the streets and roads and maintain the same and incorporate the same in the city road system. Upon acceptance of a street or a road all materials and workmanship used, grading and paving must carry a full one-year warranty from the contractor who constructed the road and/or the contractor responsible for paving and in addition a maintenance bond in the penal sum equal to the contract for the above-mentioned work performed with the city named as a beneficiary. 
(10)  When hot mix is going to be applied, specifications for setup and primer are same as for surface treatment. Asphalt shall be applied at no less than one and one-half (11/2) inches compacted of type as specified by public works director. 
(11)  All cost including, but not limited to, the full cost of the crushed gravel aggregates, including transportation and spreading thereof; the full cost of labor, materials and equipment for surface treatment; the full cost of pipe culverts and/or bridges and installation thereof; seeding and/or riprapping; the full cost of providing city with proper deed of right-of-way and plat shall be borne by the owner-developer. There will be no fee for inspection by the city as required by this division. 
(12)  In addition, the mayor shall promulgate such rules and regulations pertaining to subdivision roads and acceptance thereof as he deems necessary and desirable so long as the same are not inconsistent therewith and provide for regulations of all subdivision and developers in the same or similar circumstances. 
Such rules and regulations when furnished to a member of city council shall have full force of law unless revoked by majority of the city council within thirty (30) days after such notification. 
(Ord. No. 94-16, § II, 11-8-94) 
Sec. 23-103. - Construction phases. 
    Phases of construction not specifically covered under this division shall meet or exceed state highway department standard specifications for highway construction and any variance must be consistent with the intent of this division and be in writing by the mayor.

(Ord. No. 94-15, § V, 11-8-94) 
Sec. 23-126. - Surface treatment of county roadways. 
    Further, the city presently has dirt city-maintained roadways. Therefore, any and all roadways accepted under this division shall not be considered for surface treatment at the city's expense during the probationary period after which time the roadway shall be given the same consideration as all other city-maintained roadways. 
(Ord. No. 94-15, § VI, 11-8-94) 
Sec. 23-127. - Extension of existing county roadways. 
    An extension to an existing city-maintained roadway may be accepted into the city system for maintenance when the extension serves at least one qualifying unit per two-tenths (0.2) mile, scores at least twenty-two and five-tenths (22.5) per qualifying unit using the above-referenced formula and meets or exceeds requirements of this division and/or other applicable ordinances.

(2)  Be fifty (50) or more years old and have been designated as historic by the city council either individually or as contributing property in a local historic district.

(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of this time, place and use. Change that creates a false sense of historical development shall not be undertaken.

(5)  Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.

After the state department of archives and history gives final approval, the property owner shall notify the department of any additional work, other than ordinary maintenance, before the ten-year expiration of the special property assessment. The department shall notify the property owner in writing if the overall project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation. If the additional work is found to be inconsistent, the department shall notify the owner in writing of its decision to rescind approval within thirty (30) days. The property owner may withdraw his request and cancel or revise the proposed additional work.

In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the superintendent will give consideration to such factors as quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are: 
(a)  Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred sixty (160) degrees Fahrenheit (seventy (70) degrees Celsius). 
(b)  Any waste or water containing fats, wax, grease or oil in excess of fifty (50) mg/l, as determined by results of the freon extractable test, and the reasonable interpretation of test results, and/or auxiliary tests, to exclude from the measurement values which do not represent fats, wax, grease and oil. 
(c)  Any garbage other than ground residential garbage. 
(d)  Any acidic or alkaline wastewaters having pH values outside the range of 6.0 to 10. 
(e)  Heavy metals and toxic, refractory, organic chemicals in concentrations or quantities sufficient to limit treatment plant capability or efficiency, adversely affect effluent quality by their presence or effects, or to limit the means of disposal or utilization of treatment plant sludge by their presence. The superintendent may issue lists of prohibited metals and toxic chemicals and guidelines and criteria for limiting their acceptance as required for operation of the treatment system. 
(f)  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half life or concentrations as may exceed public safety limits or cause the plant effluent or sludge to exceed any applicable state or federal regulations. 
(g)  Any materials which exert or cause: 
(1)  Unusual oxygen demand or chlorine demand in such amounts as to constitute a significant load or an operating problem. 
(2)  Excessive discoloration of treatment plant effluence. 
(3)  Unusual odors in the treatment plant effluent or unusual odors in the sewerage system. 
(Ord. No. 79-4, Art. VI, § 3, 7-10-79) 
Sec. 25-120. - Limitations on compatible wastes. 
(a)  No person shall discharge large quantities of compatible wastewaters to public sewers which, by reason of volume, flow rate, concentrations or total loads of compatible constituents, are in excess of the capacity of a part of the sewerage system or are inconsistent with the most beneficial use of the system in the opinion of the superintendent. In consideration of these factors, the superintendent will limit the following: 
(1)  Volume and flow rate from any individual source to the capacity of sewers, pump stations and force mains and the treatment system, less the capacity committed to serve the general public and other users, and the reserve capacity to serve anticipated needs of the general public until the time of a planned expansion of facilities. 
(2)  Loads of compatible pollutants, such as BOD, suspended solids, nitrogen and phosphorus from any individual source to the capacity of the treatment facilities, less the capacity committed to serve the general public and other users and reserve capacity to serve the anticipated needs of the general public until the time of a planned expansion of the treatment facilities. 
(b)  The superintendent may require flow equalization or pretreatment for load reduction as condition of a service permit or he may decline to receive high loads or highly concentrated wastewaters into the system if, in his opinion, this would not be the most beneficial use of the system, by reason of the cost of services, technical considerations relating to operation and maintenance of the system, or conflicting alternatives for the provision of services. 
(Ord. No. 79-4, Art. VI, § 4, 7-10-79) 
Sec. 25-121. - Required installation of backflow preventers. 
(a)  Any user of the city sanitary sewer system who has a private sewer service line which:

DIVISION 6. - USE CHARGES 

Sec. 25-132. - Generally. 
    Sewer use charges are based upon the proposition that costs of services are to be distributed equitably among users of the services. The principle is embodied in the Federal Clean Water Act and underlies agreements between the commission and EPA in funding the construction of facilities, and agreements between the commission and the city and the Towns of Westminster and Walhalla for the provisions of services and payment of costs. According to these agreements, there will be three (3) rates for payment for services by users, as follows: 
(1)  Household rate(s); 
(2)  Industrial base rate; 
(3)  Industrial wastewater surcharges. 
(Ord. No. 79-4, Art. VII, § 1, 7-10-79) 
Sec. 25-133. - Household rate(s). 
(a)  Inside city. Householders and persons discharging only normal sanitary wastewaters, who are water-sewer customers of the city shall be charged such rates as the city shall determine. Such rates shall be stated in terms of cents per thousand (1,000) gallons of wastewater and shall include any charge which the city may make to cover the costs, etc., as well as the charge by the commission for the transportation and treatment of wastewater. 
(b)  Outside city. Householders and persons discharging only normal sanitary wastewater who are not water-sewer customers of the city will likewise be charged with an estimated volume of sewage at the household rates stated in terms of cents per thousand (1,000) gallons of wastewater. In the event there is no meter or method of determining the amount of water consumed by such person(s), it shall be presumed that there will be a minimum of sixty (60) gallons of wastewater per person residing in the household, per day, discharged into the system. 
(c)  Adjustments. The volume of sewage will be estimated to be the same as the volume of water used for household users if metered, or the assumed amount if unmetered, unless it can be demonstrated that the two (2) volumes are substantially different in a greater proportion than is normal. Metered water volume intake will be the usual value used for billing sewer use charges, where applicable. Procedures for requesting variances and appeal of billings for non-municipal users are included in division 2 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 79-4, Art. VII, § 2, 7-10-79) 
Sec. 25-134. - Industrial base rate. 
(a)  Persons discharging industrial wastewaters will be charged for estimated volume of wastewater sewered on industrial base rate stated in terms of cents per thousand (1,000) gallons. The rate is made up of three (3) parts, to wit: 
(1)  The costs of collection, transport and treatment; 
(2)  Industrial cost recovery (ICR), which is a charge to recover capital cost contributions made by the federal government for construction of wastewater treatment works, in proportion to the fraction of the capacity used by the individual industrial user; 
(3)  Costs of flow measurements, sampling analyses, administration and billing industrial wastewater accounts by the city. 
(b)  Wastewater volumes will be estimated to be equal to metered water use, unless it can be demonstrated that they are substantially different in proportion than is normal, and alternative measurements such as direct measurement of wastewater volume are available. 
(Ord. No. 79-4, Art. VII, § 3, 7-10-79) 
Sec. 25-135. - Industrial waste surcharge. 
(a)  Persons discharging industrial wastes will be charged for loads of BOD, suspended solids, total Kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus in the wastewater in concentrations in excess of those normal for sanitary sewage and allowed for in the industrial base rate. 
Maximum concentration of parameters allowed in the base rate are: 
(1)  BOD 5 , two hundred ten (210) mg/l; 
(2)  Suspended solids, two hundred thirty (230) mg/l; 
(3)  Total Kjeldahl, nitrogen, thirty (30) mg/l; 
(4)  Total phosphorus, twelve (12) mg/l. 
(b)  Surcharge rates will be stated in terms of cents per pound for each parameter. Quantities of surchargeable materials will be determined by flow measurements (or estimates) sampling, analyses and calculation. Sampling and analyses will be done by the commission and/or the city, using twenty-four hour composite samples, taken during a representative operating day of the industry. The minimum sampling frequency will be one day for each three-month billing period. Wastewater analyses will be performed according to procedures of the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, ADHA, AWWA, WPCF. Average results of sample analyses will be used for calculating surcharges for each parameter over the billing period according to the following example calculation: 
Assume Average Measured BOD = 600 mg/l = (600 lb/10 6 lb. WW) 
Assumed Measured Volume = 900,000 gal./quarter 
Limit of Base Rate BOD = 210 mg/l = (200 lb/10 6 lb. WW) 
Assume BOD Surcharge = ¢/lb. 
Wastewater weights 8.34 lb/gal. 
BOD Surcharge = 600 / minus 210 × 900,000 × 8.34 × ¢/lb. 10 6 × 100 
= $/quarter 
(c)  Administration for the industrial monitoring program and billings to industrial accounts will be made by the city and will include statements of base rate billings, surcharge billings and the basis of billings. 
(d)  The city will enter into agreement with industries specifying alternate methods of sewage flow determination and sampling as conditions of an industry service permit. Procedures for variances and appeals are described in division 2 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 79-4, Art. VII, § 4, 7-10-79)

(j)  Each wrecker service shall be responsible for securing personal property in a vehicle at an accident scene as best it can and the wrecker service shall be responsible for reasonably attempting to preserve personal property in a vehicle which is about to be towed from an accident scene. 
(k)  All wrecker service personnel must wear appropriate clothing when responding to a wrecker request from the police department. Appropriate clothing includes (but is not limited to) shirts which bear the name of the wrecker service and the employee, and trousers which have a leg length that touches the ankles. 
(Ord. No. 81-12, § 1, 9-8-81, Ord. No. 98-9, 8-11-98) 
Sec. 26-88. - Same-Rules for administering the wrecker rotation list. 
(a)  No police department employee shall hold any financial interest or any form of ownership interest in any wrecker service included on the wrecker rotation list. 
(b)  Police department employees shall not recommend any wrecker service to the owner or operator of a wrecked or disabled vehicle, nor shall any police department employee ever recommend the services of a particular wrecker service in the performance of their duties. 
(c)  The wrecker rotation list shall be administered fairly and in a manner designed to insure that all wrecker services on the list have an equal opportunity to the towing business arising from the rotation list. 
(d)  Wrecker services shall be called from the rotation list in the order in which they appear on the list. If a particular wrecker service is unavailable when called, it shall be passed over and the next wrecker service on the list shall be called to the scene. 
(e)  When the services of wrecker rotation list companies are needed for more than one vehicle, a separate wrecker service will be called for each vehicle to be towed. 
(f)  The wrecker service must be approved by the state highway patrol and must have a wrecker of sufficient size and strength to handle the job. The police department shall have the right not to call a wrecker service which, in its opinion, fails to meet this qualification. Under these conditions, the wrecker service not called shall remain on the top of the rotation list. 
(g)  A wrecker service may secure assistance from another wrecker service on the rotation list when necessary to do the job. Only one (1) bill is to be submitted to the owner or operator for the work performed. 
(h)  When a wrecker service or wrecker driver is unable to answer a call, the police department shall be promptly notified of the reason for the unavailability. 
(i)  Wrecker companies who do not properly care for customer's vehicles or property may be removed from the wrecker rotation list. 
(j)  Complaints from wrecker services regarding an incident involving the police department or its operation of the wrecker list must be received within ten (10) days of the alleged incident. Complaints should be directed to the chief of police of the police department. 
(k)  Failure of any wrecker service to comply with the requirements set forth in this article may result in the removal from the wrecker rotation list. 
(l)  The chief of police, or his designee, has the authority to add or remove wrecker companies from the wrecker rotation list based on the provisions of this article. In the event that a wrecker service is removed from the wrecker rotation list, the chief of police, or his designee, will inform the wrecker service when they may reapply for inclusion to the list. 
(m)  Any wrecker service who is denied inclusion to the wrecker rotation list, or any wrecker service who is removed from the wrecker rotation list may appeal the decision to the mayor of the city. All appeals must be received by the mayor within ten (10) working days of the date the action was taken against the wrecker service. The mayor shall respond to the appeal within ten (10) working days after receiving the appeal.

interrelationships, buffer treatments, separation of uses with potentially incompatible characteristics of use, design
of access patterns, and relationships of uses within Planned Development with uses in adjacent districts. It is the

shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeals the entire record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from
whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Zoning Appeals, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed
with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, or other matter

904.2 To hear and decide appeals for variance from the requirement of the zoning ordinance when strict
application of the provisions of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance may be granted in
an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the Board of Zoning Appeals makes and explains in writing the
following findings:
a) There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question
because of its size, shape, or topography;
b) Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved and do not generally apply to other
property in the vicinity;
c) Because of these conditions, the application of the Ordinance on this particular piece of property would
effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property;
d) The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or to the public
good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance.
e) The board may not grant a variance the effect of which would be to allow the establishment of a use not
otherwise permitted in a zoning district, to extend physically a non-conforming use of land, or to change the zoning district boundaries shown on the official zoning map. The fact that property may be utilized more profitably, should a variance be granted, may not be considered grounds for a variance.

SECTION 1003 PROCEDURE FOR AMENDMENTS
Requests to amend the Zoning Ordinance shall be processed in accordance with the following requirements:
1003.1 Initiation of Amendments. A proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance may be initiated by the City
Council, the Planning Commission or by application filed with the Planning Department by the owner or owners
of the property proposed to be changed, provided, however, that action shall not be initiated for a zoning
amendment affecting the same parcel or parcels of property, or any part thereof, and requesting the same change
in district classification by a property owner or owners more often than once every twelve (12) months.
Initiation commences upon payment of an application fee to be established by the City Council of the City of
Seneca, and the submission of a completed application form with all required attached documents.
1003.2 Application Procedure. Application forms for amendment requests shall be obtained from the Zoning
Administrator. Completed forms, together with an application fee to cover administrative costs, plus any
additional information the applicant feels to be pertinent, will be filed with the Zoning Administrator. Any
communication purporting to be an application for an amendment shall be regarded as mere notice to seek relief
until it is made in the form required.
1003.3 Hearing by the Planning Commission. All papers and other data submitted by the applicant on behalf of the amendment request shall be transmitted to the Planning Commission by the Zoning Administrator. The Planning Commission, at its regular meeting, shall review and prepare a report, including its recommendation, for
transmittal to the City Council. All meetings of the Planning Commission shall be open to the public. At a
meeting, any party may appear in person, or by agent, or by attorney. No member of the Planning Commission
shall participate in a matter in which he has any pecuniary or special interest. Following action by the Planning
Commission, all records and data pertinent to the application shall be transmitted to the City Council for final
action.
1003.4 Public Hearing by the City Council. Before enacting an amendment to this Ordinance, the City Council
shall hold a public hearing thereon at least fifteen (15) days notice of the time and place of which shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. Fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the
public hearing, conspicuous notice shall be posted on or adjacent to the property affected, with at least one such
notice being visible from each public thoroughfare that abuts the property.
The City Council may, at its discretion, delegate the power and responsibility to hold the required public hearing
to the Planning Commission for any or all amendments. In such cases as the Planning Commission conducts the
Public Hearing, the City Council shall not be required to hold another before acting on the recommendation.
This is permissive, however, and expressly does not preclude the City Council from conducting its own public
hearing on the amendment.
1003.5 Changes in the Zoning Map. Following final action by the City Council, any necessary changes shall be
made in the Zoning Map. A written record of the type and date of such change shall be maintained by the
Zoning Administrator. Until such change is made, no action by the City Council on map amendments to the
Zoning Ordinance shall be considered official, unless the Zoning Administrator fails to make the change within
seven (7) days after formal action by the City Council. In the latter event, action by the City Council shall be
considered official seven (7) days after the date of the action even if the Zoning Administrator has failed to
make the appropriate changes.

(Ord. 2005.12)
City of Seneca
115
1210.6 Submission of a New Application. If the Board determines that a Certificate of Appropriateness should be denied, a new application affecting the same property may be submitted only if substantial change is made in the plans for the proposed work.
1210.7 Maintenance, Repair, and Interior Projects. Nothing in this document shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature of structures designated as historic when that repair does not involve a change in design, material, color, or outer appearance of the structure. The Board shall not consider the interior arrangements or alterations to the interior of a building unless the interior of a public building or the public space of a private building is specifically described and designated as historic. The Board may authorize a staff member to approve minor projects involving repairs and ordinary maintenance that do not alter design, materials, color or the outer appearance of a structure or interior projects not subject to design review.
1210.8 Fines and Penalties. The system of fines applied by the City of Seneca for violation of the zoning ordinance will apply to violations of this ordinance.
1210.9 Substantial Hardship. In the event a Certificate of Appropriateness is denied, the property owner may apply for an exemption based on the substantial hardship of maintaining the property according to the design guidelines for historic properties. Substantial hardship is to be considered by the Board where one or more of the following unusual and compelling circumstances exist:
a. the property cannot reasonably be maintained in the manner dictated by the ordinance,
b. there are no other reasonable means of saving the property from deterioration, or collapse, or
c. the property is owned by a nonprofit organization and it is not feasible financially or physically to achieve
the charitable purposes of the organization while maintaining the property appropriately.
The owner may be required to submit documents to show that he cannot comply with the design guidelines and earn a reasonable rate of return on his investment in the property. Information required may include:
a. costs of the proposed development with and without modification needed to comply with the design
guidelines as determined by the Board,
b. structural report and/or a feasibility report,
c. market value of the property in its present condition and after completion of the proposed project,
d. cost of the property, date purchased, relationship, if any, between seller and buyer, terms of financing,
e. for the past two years, annual gross income from the property with operating and maintenance expenses,
depreciation, and annual cash flow before and after debt service during that time, and
f. other information considered necessary by the Board to determine whether or not the property may yield a
reasonable return.
1210.10 Demolition. If the Board denies, or postpones for 180 days, a request to demolish a historic building, the Board shall work closely with the owner to find an appropriate use for the property, to help find a buyer or to obtain funding for rehabilitation, including low interest loans or grants. The Board shall inform the community concerning the threat to the building, it value as part of the fabric of the community and, through publicity and contacts with civic groups, seek to provide assistance in preserving the property.
SECTION 1211 DESIGN GUIDELINES
1211.1 Intent. It is the intent of this ordinance to ensure, insofar as possible, that properties designated as historic shall be in harmony with the architectural and historical character of the City of Seneca. In granting a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Board shall take into account the architectural and historical significance of the structure
City of Seneca
116
under consideration and the exterior form and appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that structure as well as the effect of such change or additions upon other structures in the vicinity.
1211.2 Seneca Design Review Guidelines. When considering an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness for new construction, alteration, repair, or restoration, the Board shall use the Seneca Design Review Guidelines dated June 2002, as hereby adopted by reference as though they were copied herein fully, in making its decisions. These guidelines serve as the basis for determining the approval, approval with modifications, or denial of an application. (Ord. 2002-09)
SECTION 1212 APPEALS
Any person may appeal a decision of the Board to the Courts of South Carolina pursuant to the South Carolina
Code of Laws, Section 6-29-900 et sequitur.
