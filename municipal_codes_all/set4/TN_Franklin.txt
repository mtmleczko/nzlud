PREFACE 
    This Code is a republication of the 1995 Code of Ordinances as supplemented through December 2006. Ordinances were added in this republication through Ordinance No. 2008-50, adopted October 14, 2008. 
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

    This republication was prepared under the supervision of A. Lawton Langford, Corporate President, and Linda Davis, Editor, with the able assistance of the MCC staff. Portions of the preface as it appears in the 1993 codification are reprinted herein as follows: 
    The Franklin Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of the ordinances of the City of Franklin, Tennessee. By referring to the historical citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the origin of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means that the section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical citation indicates significant modification of the original ordinance. 
    The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit, followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106. 
    By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for a comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances. 
    Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures, if any, prescribed by the city's charter. 
ORDINANCE ADOPTION PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED 
BY THE CITY CHARTER [Article V] 

Section 4. - Ordinance Adoption. 
    All ordinances shall begin with the enacting clause, "BE IT ORDAINED BY THE BOARD OF MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF FRANKLIN". Every proposed ordinance shall be introduced in writing, in the form required for final adoption and, as nearly as practicable, as amending, repealing or adding sections or chapters to the city code. Upon introduction, the city administrator shall distribute a copy to each member of the board. The body of ordinances may be omitted from the journal, but reference shall be made to the ordinance by number and subject matter. No appropriation of money, levy or taxes, or zoning change shall be made unless the ordinance authorizing the same be passed on three (3) different days, and shall have received on its final passage an affirmative vote of a majority of the entire board. Annexation or de-annexation of property shall be accomplished by ordinance or resolution as provided by state law, and the same shall be passed on three (3) different days, and shall have received on its final passage an affirmative vote of a majority of the entire board. All other ordinances shall be passed on two (2) separate days. Every ordinance shall be effective upon final passage unless by its terms the effective date is deferred. Ordinances shall be authenticated by the recorder or in such manner as the board by resolution shall direct. A summary of the material provisions of every ordinance and a notice that it is on file in the recorder's office shall be published in a newspaper circulating in the city. 
SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
  
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

HOUSE BILL NO. 1308 
By Frensley, Hobbs 
Substituted for: Senate Bill No. 1320 
By Richardson 
AN ACT to authorize the city of Franklin to levy and collect a privilege tax on new development in the city in order to provide that new development contribute its fair share of the cost of providing public facilities and services made necessary by such new development. 
    WHEREAS, Williamson County, Tennessee, where Franklin is the county seat has been the fastest growing county in the state for the past fifteen (15) years, having been impacted by the rapid growth in the standard metropolitan area of Nashville; and 
    WHEREAS, anticipated continued growth from the expansion of Nashville is expected to accelerate due to the location of the hub of American Airlines in the Nashville area, and from other factors; and 
    WHEREAS, after an intense national competition, the state of Tennessee successfully negotiated with the General Motors Corporation to locate its Saturn plant in Tennessee; and 
    WHEREAS, General Motors Corporation selected and is presently constructing the Saturn automotive assembly plant in an unincorporated area of Maury County just south of the Williamson County line at Spring Hill; and 
    WHEREAS, the investment in said plant is anticipated to be approximately $3.5 billion when the plant is complete; and 
    WHEREAS, Maury County has negotiated a Payment in Lieu of Tax (PILOT) Agreement with General Motors whereby the Saturn plant will make payments in lieu of property tax in the amount of $43.430 million over the next fifteen (15) years, but the city of Franklin, lying within a few miles of the plant has no such agreement, and will receive no such benefit; and 
    WHEREAS, the Saturn plant is anticipated to stimulate commercial, office, industrial and warehouse development in Franklin in the vicinity of the Saturn plant; and 
    WHEREAS, the projected non-residential development and the availability of jobs is anticipated to stimulate a significant demand for new dwelling units in Franklin; and 
    WHEREAS, current projections show that: 
(1)  County population will be 129,000 persons in year 2005, an increase of 122% from 1980 to 2005; there will be a demand for approximately 22,000 additional dwelling units between 1980 and 2005; and new residential and non-residential development shall consume an additional 14,000 acres of land in Williamson County; 
(2)  projected growth and land use development will cause a demand for county provided capital facilities (schools, roads, jails, parks, etc.) in an amount well in excess of $50 million over the next fifteen (15) years; 
(3)  the city's present revenue raising authority is limited and relies heavily on intergovernmental transfers which are not subject to city control and on property taxes, which would impose the costs of new growth on existing residents rather than on new residents and businesses who create the demand for the additional expenditures; and 
    WHEREAS, Franklin is committed to both present and future county residents in maintaining a level of public facilities and services commensurate with those presently provided; and 
    WHEREAS, Franklin is prepared to impose a fair, equitable and reasonable share of the costs of providing the necessary public facilities and services on existing residents of the county; and 
    WHEREAS, the city's present population employment base, tax base and budget cannot alone support the additional revenues needed to supply facilities to serve new growth without a substantial increase in the property tax rate on existing development; and 
    WHEREAS, the introduction of the Saturn plant in Maury County, the American Airlines Hub in Davidson County, and the continued expansion of the Nashville Metropolitan area represent both an extraordinary economic opportunity for the state of Tennessee as well as a potential economic burden on the existing residents of Franklin; and 
    WHEREAS, due to these unique circumstances, it is necessary and appropriate that Franklin be given authorization to extend its taxing power to enable the city to impose a fair and reasonable share of the costs of public facilities necessitated by new development on that development so as not to create an unfair and inequitable burden on existing city residents; and 
    WHEREAS, there is precedent in the state of Tennessee for such additional tax measures to impose costs on those who benefit from improvements and where the result would otherwise be to impose an unfair burden on existing residents; and 
    WHEREAS, the most logical and effective mechanism to accomplish the intended result would be the imposition of a new privilege tax on new development in Franklin; now, therefore, 
    BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:

    WHEREAS, tremendous growth in construction of houses, condominiums, apartments, and businesses is occurring in many areas of the state and the construction of new residences and businesses and the expansion of existing businesses has created and imposes severe financial pressure on the municipality of Franklin to provide urban type services, such as water, sewage, drainage, parks and roads; and 
    WHEREAS, Franklin lacks the financial base capable of generating the funds required to provide services and capital improvements to new residences and businesses that such new growth demands; and 
    WHEREAS, in order to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens and residents of Franklin, it is necessary that an additional method of financing public improvements for urban type services be granted and that Franklin be authorized to levy impact fees upon new developments, with the fees collected and earmarked for the funding of such services necessitated by the new development; now, therefore,

(d)  "Developer" means the person, corporation, partnership, or other entity responsible for any new land development. 
    SECTION 3.

    SECTION 4. Franklin may perform or order the construction, reconstruction, building, replacement, extension, enlargement, or repair of any capital or public improvement and provide for the payment of the cost of any such public improvements by and collecting an impact fee on new land development.

CHAPTER 4. - ADEQUATE FACILITIES TAX 

Sec. 5-401. - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known and cited as the Franklin Adequate Facilities Tax. 
(1976 Code, § 6-201) 
Sec. 5-402. - Purpose. 
    This chapter is intended to assure the provision of adequate park, police, fire safety and sanitation facilities to serve new development in the city by requiring each new development to pay a tax proportionate to the need for new facilities created by such development, the proceeds of which shall be used exclusively to fund capital improvements made necessary by new growth. 
(1976 Code, § 6-202) 
Sec. 5-403. - Findings. 
    The board of mayor and aldermen (hereinafter "board") hereby finds and declares that: 
(1)  Williamson County, a suburban County of metropolitan Nashville, of which the City of Franklin is the county seat, is the fastest growing county in the State of Tennessee. 
(2)  The county is experiencing rapid population and employment growth, in part as a result of the location of regional employment facilities, such as the American Airlines hub and the General Motors Corporation's Saturn plant. 
(3)  The City of Franklin will experience an increase of 2,155 residential dwelling units and 1.4 million square feet of nonresidential development by the year 1993. 
(4)  The anticipated population and employment growth in Franklin creates the demand for additional park and recreational facilities, police and fire safety facilities and sanitation facilities. 
(5)  The city is responsible for and committed to the provision of such public facilities and services at levels of service necessary to support anticipated residential and employment growth. 
(6)  The city has prepared a five-year capital improvements plan which identifies such facilities and service levels, and which designates the sources of funding the same. 
(7)  The capital improvements costs of providing additional park and recreational facilities, police and fire safety facilities and sanitation facilities to serve new growth for the next 20 years will be approximately $17.5 million.

For the purposes of this chapter, the "bounds of the permittee's business" means that furniture must be located alongside, but not beyond, the corners or ends of the permitted establishment's outside walls. This prohibition shall create a zone that keeps sidewalk and street corners clear for pedestrian travel. 
(c)  The sidewalk dining area shall not be designated by any type of physical barrier; however, the sidewalk dining area's border may be marked by the owner with materials approved by the streets director and design approved by the building and neighborhood services department administrator.

(3)  Arrange the cafe furniture so as to impede the efficiency of or pose a hazard to the pedestrian path or street corners.

(4)  Place or allow single or multiple tables or displays by organizations, establishments or businesses for vending goods, for distributing information or for displaying goods in the permitted sidewalk dining area as these activities encourage people to stop, loiter, overcrowd the sidewalk or obtain correct change, all of which potentially impedes the efficiency of the pedestrian path, and conflicts with the city's style and ambience which the city seeks to preserve, unless sidewalk sale, special event or other appropriate permits have been granted pursuant to this Code.

Also, the permittee's trash receptacles and bussing equipment shall not be permitted to remain in the sidewalk dining area, but shall be stored indoors.

    Any motor vehicle parked upon any public street, alley, properly designated fire lane situated on either public or private land, or sidewalk of the city, at a place, in a manner, or for a length of time prohibited by any provision of the Franklin Municipal Code is, if unattended, hereby declared to be an obstruction in such way and a public nuisance. Any police officer of the city is hereby authorized to cause such vehicle to be removed and impounded in a place designated by the city for such purpose. 
    Any vehicle impounded pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be surrendered to the duly identified owner thereof only after he or she has paid an impoundment fee as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, for each day, or fraction thereof, a vehicle is stored. 
    When any impounded vehicle is not claimed within 48 hours after impoundment, the chief of police shall make a diligent effort to identify and locate the owner thereof and advise him or her of the impoundment of his or her vehicle and where it may be claimed. Inquiries shall be made in the neighborhood or area where the vehicle was found and information obtained from papers in the vehicle shall be investigated.

    Prior to the sale the chief of police shall certify that the provisions of this section have been strictly observed, that the motor vehicle has not been claimed, and is, therefore, authorized to be sold as an abandoned vehicle pursuant to the provisions of this section. At any time prior to the sale the duly identified owner of the vehicle may recover his vehicle by paying the impoundment fee and accrued storage costs. 
    The proceeds of the sale, less the impoundment fee and storage costs, shall be paid to the owner of the vehicle sold, if known, unless there is a known lien of record of such vehicle.

If the identity or location of the owner has not been determined after diligent search the net proceeds of the sale shall be held for six months during, which time the owner may establish his title and claim them. Thereafter, such funds shall be paid into the general fund of the city. 
    Impoundment and/or sale of any motor vehicle pursuant to the provisions of this section shall in no way relieve any person of his liability for violating any ordinance of this city. The sole purpose of this section is to provide a means for expeditiously and effectively abating certain public nuisances. It expressly is not intended hereby to assess any forfeiture or penalty for violating any ordinance of this city.

The reference in the schedules to square feet refers to floor area as defined herein. 
(2)  The road impact fee administrator shall be responsible for calculating the appropriate fee for all building permit applications. If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied is not specified on the fee schedule, the road impact fee administrator shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The road impact fee administrator shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Manual (latest edition), studies or reports done by the United States Department of Transportation or the state department of transportation, articles or reports appearing in the ITE Journal or other, similar sources. If the road impact fee administrator determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the fee schedule or that the fee schedule understates the cost to mitigate the road impacts of the development due to the nature, timing or location of the proposed development, the road impact fee administrator shall cause to be prepared an individual assessment pursuant to section 16-411. 
(3)  If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed uses, then the fee shall be determined by apportioning the total space within the building according to the space devoted to each principal use. A shopping area shall be considered a principal use and shall be assessed at the general retail rate. 
(4)  An application for a building permit to create an addition to an existing structure or to build another structure on the same site with an existing structure shall be subject to the payment of an impact fee, provided that only the new residential units or nonresidential square footage to be added to the existing structure or site shall be subject to the fee. Remodeling activity that does not increase the number of residential units or the amount of nonresidential square footage shall not require payment of an impact fee. 
(5)  When a change or expansion of a land use or the redevelopment, replacement or modification of an existing building or structure requires the issuance of a permit the road impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. No impact fee credits or refunds will be granted if a net decrease results. The previous use or structure shall be the most recent use of the site within the nine years prior to the application for the building permit, provided that the applicant can provide records to confirm the previous building size and land use. 
(6)  If the road impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated and the difference refunded to the original fee payer or collected by the city, whichever is applicable. If road impact fees are owed, no permits of any type may be issued for the building structure in question, or for any other portion of a development of which the building or structure in question is a part, until impact fees are paid. The road impact fee administrator may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees. 
(7)  Residential development projects consisting of single-family or townhouse dwelling units whose final plat have been approved prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 2017-02 shall be entitled to pay the fee in effect at the time of final plat approval, for so long as the final plat is valid. 
(8)  Nonresidential development projects and residential development projects consisting solely of apartments or condominiums whose site plans have been approved prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 2017-02 shall be entitled to pay the fee in effect at the time of site plan approval, for so long as the site plan is valid and provided all of the buildings and structures associated with the site plan have been issued a valid building permit within three years from the date of the building permit issued for the first building or structure within the site plan. 
(9)  Nonresidential development projects and residential development projects consisting solely of apartments or condominiums whose site plans have been submitted prior to July 1, 2017, and approved prior to October 1, 2017, shall be entitled to pay the fee in effect at the time of submission of the site plan so long as all application and plan review fees have been paid to the city and provided all of the buildings associated with the site plan have been issued a valid building permit within three years from the date of the building permit issued for the first building within the site plan. All development projects whose site plans have been submitted after July 1, 2017, shall pay fees in accordance with this chapter.

Sec. 16-411. - Individual assessment of road impacts. 
(1)  The road impact fee for a proposed new development shall be calculated by the use of an individual assessment of road impacts if: 
(a)  The type of new development is not of the type or reasonable equivalent thereof listed on the fee schedules attached as Exhibit A; or 
(b)  The road impact fee administrator determines that the nature, timing or location of the proposed development makes it likely to generate impacts costing substantially more to mitigate than the costs attributable to the development in the fee schedule; or 
(c)  The developer chooses to have the amount of the fee determined by such method. 
(2)  The developer shall be responsible for preparation of the individual assessment of road impacts if the developer chooses to conduct such analysis. The road impact fee administrator shall be responsible for preparation of the individual assessment if the type of new development being proposed is not of the type listed on the fee schedule, or the nature, timing of location of the proposed new development makes it likely that arterial or collector road improvements will be necessary to serve the development, the cost of which exceed the costs attributable to the development in the fee schedule. 
(3)  The person preparing the individual assessment of road impacts shall be a qualified professional, and shall be approved by the road impact fee administrator on the basis of professional training and experience. 
(4)  The individual assessment of road impacts shall compute the impact fee per residential unit or, in the case of nonresidential development, the impact fee per 1,000 square feet of floor area, using the following formula: 
IMPACT FEE       = VMT × COST/VMT - VMT × CREDIT/VMT VMT       = DAILY TRIPS × % NEW × LENGTH/2 COST/VMT       = COST/VMC × VMC/VMT CREDIT/VMT       = Revenue credit per VMT Where: DAILY TRIPS       = Trip ends during average weekday %NEW       = Percent of trips that are primary, as opposed to Pass-by or diverted-link trips LENGTH       = Average length of a trip on the major road system 2       = Dividing by two avoids double-counting trips for origin and destination COST/VMC       = Average cost to add a new daily vehicle-mile of capacity VMC/VMT       = System-wide ratio of vehicle-miles of capacity to vehicle-miles of travel on major road system (assumed 1:1)  
(5)  The determination of the appropriate impact fee for the development, based on the above formula, the information provided by the applicant and any other information determined to be relevant by the road impact fee administrator, shall be made by the road impact fee administrator. 
(6)  The applicant may appeal the decision of the road impact fee administrator on the individual assessment to the board of mayor and aldermen pursuant to section 16-423, Appeals.

( Ord. No. 2018-26 , § I, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 18-106. - Assessment and collection of impact fees. 
    Before a new connection is made to the water system or an existing customer increases requirements by expansion of the original served facilities, fees shall be assessed and collected by the city. 
    The impact fee and installation fee for all customers is assessed and shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
    The impact fee shall be based on the size of the meter needed to serve each customer. The smallest meter shall be a five-eighths by three-fourths-inch meter, which has a capacity of 12.5 gallons per minute. The impact fee for developments requiring larger meters will be based on its capacity in relation to the capacity of the five-eighths by three-fourths-inch meter. The developer's engineer shall determine meter sizes. The director will accept or reject the size of the meter based on: 
(1)  Information furnished to the director by the person or entity desiring to connect to the waterlines or facilities; 
(2)  Information contained in recognized state or national publications; 
(3)  Records of similar installations; or 
(4)  Information provided from other reliable sources approved by the director. 
    Where applicable, the charges as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, shall be collected by the city at the time the permit is issued. 
    These fees will be assessed for any connection inside or outside the corporate limits. 
TEMPORARY FIRE HYDRANT METERS 
    Temporary fire hydrant meters will be available for a deposit as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, and a nonrefundable setup fee as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, payable by certified check or money order. Water use will be billed at the inside commercial rate. If the meter is damaged, the cost of the damaged meter will be deducted from the deposit. Use of the fire meter will be for no more than 30 days. Temporary fire hydrant meters will be assigned to a designated fire hydrant. Removal of the fire hydrant meter to any other location will revoke the deposit fee. 
PRIVATE FIRE HYDRANTS AND SPRINKLER SYSTEMS 
    An impact fee for connection of private fire hydrants and sprinkler system lines to the city's lines shall be as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties. 
    Radio-read meters will be required on all private fire hydrants and sprinkler systems, at the discretion of the city. 
METER INSTALLATION CHARGE 
    A double-check backflow preventer with a leak detection meter shall be required on private fire lines. Should any unauthorized water flow be detected through the leak detection meter, the city reserves the right to mandate at the owner's expense installation of a fire line meter with radio read capabilities. In addition, upon determination of the director, radio read meters will be required on all private fire hydrants and sprinkler systems that are deemed inaccessible by the city always. The meter installation fee shall be as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties. 
    In the event the city does any installation work not covered in the installation fees, the cost of such work shall be charged to the customer according to a schedule of rates established by the department. 
    The standard connection charge and the private fire service connection charge shall be paid prior to the issuance of a construction permit for the installation of water facilities to serve the customer(s), prior to the issuance of a building permit, or prior to the issuance of a permit to tap a water main, whichever occurs first. 
    Service lines connected to the public water system shall be located and installed in accordance with the established standards of the city. When a service line is completed and accepted by the city as part of the public water system, the city shall be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of such service line from the water main to and including the water meter and meter box, and such portion of the service line shall belong to the city. The remaining portion of the service line beyond the meter to the customer's premises shall belong to and be the maintenance responsibility of the customer. When a service line that may not require a meter, as in the case of a dedicated fire line, is completed and accepted by the city as part of the public water system, the city shall be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of such service line from the water main to the property line, and such portion of the service line shall belong to the city. The remaining portion of the service line beyond the property line to the customer's premises shall belong to and be the maintenance responsibility of the customer. 
LOW FLOW-HIGH FLOW METERS 
    A low flow-high flow meter is two meters installed parallel to each other in the same meter box and tied to the same service line. One meter is smaller than the other and measures the normal usage of the customer. The other meter is much larger and is used to measured high flows as in fire flows or other usage through a fire hydrant. In such cases, the impact fees are calculated on one-meter size larger than the small or low flow meter. By example, if the low flow meter is a two-inch meter and the high flow meter is a six-inch meter the fees will be calculated for a three-inch domestic meter. In addition, applicable fire line access and SDF access shall be paid at the rate of the larger meter. Each proposed application for this type meter shall be reviewed and approved by the director before final construction plans are submitted and approved. 
IRRIGATION METERS 
    An irrigation meter is a meter designated for measuring the flow of water off the normal domestic water service line, intended for outdoor watering. The intended use for this meter is to allow for deduction of charges for sanitary sewer service when such water is not returned to the sanitary sewer system.

Sec. 18-107. - Reserved. 
Sec. 18-108. - Main extensions and facilities funded in whole or in part by developers. 
    If a person has been required to pay all or a part of the cost of constructing water lines or facilities (hereinafter "improvements"), which improvements become part of the Franklin Water System and are available for use and benefit of the customers of the Franklin Water System, that person may be eligible to be reimbursed a portion of its costs of construction of the said improvements. 
    Reimbursement shall be allowed only by the board of mayor and aldermen and shall be paid from a revenue source established by the board of mayor and aldermen. Cost reimbursement will not be allowed for improvements constructed, on or off-site, for the sole benefit of the development. Costs eligible for reimbursement include labor, equipment, supplies, materials, engineering design, supervision, inspection, legal, and acquisition costs for easements and right-of-way. Fiscal costs, including interest, finance charges, and other similar costs are ineligible for reimbursement. 
    The person requesting reimbursement must enter into a written agreement with the city prior to commencement of construction of any improvements for which reimbursement is sought. This agreement shall set out: 
(1)  A description of the improvements; 
(2)  The estimated total eligible costs, as above defined; 
(3)  The portion of the cost of such improvements for which reimbursement will be allowed. The latter determination shall be based generally upon the difference in sizing or capacity of the line or facility needed for the development and the size or capacity needed for the system as a whole. However, the board may in its reasonable discretion consider such other factors as are necessary for an equitable sharing of costs of any system improvements so constructed. 
    Further, prior to dedication and acceptance of the improvements by the city, the person requesting reimbursement must present to the board a detailed statement of the actual eligible costs and the board in its discretion may amend the agreement, and the reimbursement amount, to reflect the actual project costs.

    Board of mayor and aldermen may grant a variance or waiver from requirement of this chapter, upon written request by a developer or owner of property subject to this chapter. The board of mayor and aldermen shall grant the waiver or variance only upon finding that a strict application of such requirement would result in confiscation of the property. 
    The authority to make water main extensions under section 18-108 is permissive only and nothing contained therein shall be construed as requiring the city to make water main extensions or to furnish service to any person or persons. 
( Ord. No. 2018-26 , § I, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 18-110. - Construction of water lines.

    Upon completion of the construction of any such water line, and upon approval by the city, such water lines and mains shall become the property of the city. The persons paying the cost of constructing such lines and mains shall execute all written instruments required by the city that are necessary to provide evidence of the city's ownership of such lines and mains. In consideration of such lines and mains being transferred to the city, the city shall incorporate said mains as an integral part of the city's water system and shall furnish water therefrom in accordance with this chapter. 
    When for cause shown, the board of mayor and aldermen determines that it is in the best interest of the water system and the general public to extend water service, without requiring strict compliance with this section, and/or the requirements of the standard water and sewer specifications, such extension may be constructed upon such terms and conditions as shall be approved by a majority of the members of the board of mayor and aldermen. 
    The authority to extend water service is permissive only, and nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the city to provide water service to any person or entity. 
( Ord. No. 2018-26 , § I, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 18-111. - Water meters. 
(1)  All water meters shall be installed, tested, repaired, and removed by the city, or pursuant to the specifications, regulations and requirements of the city. No meter shall be installed without the consent of the city. No meter shall be tampered with or removed. 
(2)  In the event that any water meter is obstructed, blocked, covered, damaged, destroyed, concealed from view or otherwise rendered unreadable or inaccessible by the City of Franklin for purposes of monitoring water usage, or if the meter is not brought up to grade according to city specifications, the customer responsible for the meter shall be fined as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, for each month in which the meter is unreadable, or not otherwise in compliance, for any period of time. During the time that the meter is obstructed, blocked, covered, damaged, destroyed, concealed from view or otherwise rendered unreadable or inaccessible, or otherwise not in compliance, the customer shall pay to the city the minimum monthly payment for water service. 
    In addition, upon either discovery or notice by the city of the fact that the meter is obstructed, blocked, covered, damaged, destroyed, concealed from view or otherwise rendered unreadable, inaccessible, or not brought to grade, the customer shall immediately take measures to have the meter unobstructed and or uncovered so that it may be read and is accessible by the city. In addition, when the meter is uncovered and or unobstructed, the customer responsible shall pay for the total consumption since the last available reading. 
    If any damage results from the meter being obstructed, blocked, covered, damaged, destroyed, concealed from view or otherwise rendered unreadable or inaccessible, or otherwise not in compliance with city specifications, the customer shall be billed for the repairs and/or replacement of the meter, but shall not be billed less than as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties. 
    Any repairs, replacement or relocation of meters, boxes, service lines or associated utilities, necessitated by damage to meters, boxes, service lines or associated utilities, or failure to install according to city specifications, shall be paid by the responsible customer and shall be billed at full replacement price. All materials shall be billed at full retail value along with associated equipment and labor costs. There shall be a one-hour minimum labor charge for repair replacement or relocation of any damaged water utilities. 
    The costs of any relocation of an existing service requested by a customer shall be billed to such customer. All materials shall be billed at full retail value along with associated labor and equipment costs. There shall be a one-hour minimum labor charge for relocation of any water utilities. 
(3)  Service shall not commence to any new customer if the meter is obstructed, covered, damaged, or otherwise unreadable or inaccessible by the city, or is not brought to grade or otherwise not installed according to city specifications. In addition, the monthly bill for service shall remain the responsibility of the builder, and there shall be a fine as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, for each month in which the meter is obstructed, covered, damaged or otherwise unreadable or inaccessible by the city or is not brought to grade or otherwise not installed according to city specifications. 
(4)  If a customer in whose name new service has been extended fails, after reasonable notice by the city, to correct any improperly installed water, as herein before described, the city reserves the right to refuse new service to the builder at other locations in the city until the deficiency is corrected. 
(5)  Any unauthorized removal or tampering with the meter shall result in a fine as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, per occurrence.

Sec. 18-112. - Meter tests. 
    The city will, at its own expense, make routine tests of meters when it considers such tests desirable. 
    In testing meters, the water passing through a meter will be measured at various rates of discharge and under varying pressures. To be considered accurate, the meter registration shall check with the measured amounts of water within the percentage shown in the following table: 
Meter Size Percentage 5/8 ", 3/4", 1", 2" 2% 3" 3% 4" 4% 6" 5%  
    If a customer requests a meter test, and the test results indicate that the meter is reading lower than actual water flow or reads within these percentages, the customer must pay all expenses related to testing the meter. 
( Ord. No. 2018-26 , § I, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 18-113. - Multiple services through a single meter. 
    No customer shall supply water service to more than one dwelling or premise from a single service line. 
( Ord. No. 2018-26 , § I, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 18-114. - Billing for water service. 
    All water bills may be rendered weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly, at the option of the city. 
    The bills will consist of charges for the user service fee, consisting of the availability charge, the customer service charge and the consumption service charge, as well as other services obtained by the customer from the city in accord with the agreement between the customer and the city and the provisions of the Municipal Code. 
    The water service bill is based on gallons of water delivered. An availability charge applies if water is available, even if the customer has not connected to the sewer or there is no consumption for the period. 
    Water bills must be paid on or before the due date shown thereon to obtain the net or discount rate, otherwise the gross rate shall apply which includes a penalty of ten percent of the net amount billed for water. Failure to receive a bill will not release a customer from payment obligation, nor extend the due date. 
    In the event a bill is not paid on or before 15 days after the discount date, the customer's service may be discontinued without further notice. The city shall not be liable for any damages resulting from discontinued service under the provisions of this section, even though payment of the bill is made at any time on the day that service is discontinued. 
    Should the final date of payment of bill at the net rate fall on a weekend or a holiday, the business day next following the final date will be the last day to obtain the net rate. A net remittance received by mail after the time limit for payment at the net rate will be accepted by the city if the envelope is date-stamped on or before the final date for payment of the net amount. 
    If a water meter fails to register properly, or if a meter is removed to be tested or repaired, or if water is received other than through a meter, the city reserves the right to render an estimated bill based on the best information available. Any unauthorized removal or tampering with the meter will result in a fine as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, per occurrence. 
    The wastewater (sewer) service charge shall not apply to separately metered water delivery points that are owned, maintained and read by the water provider where there is no potential for the wastewater stream of entering the wastewater stream (e.g., separately metered irrigation and cooling tower applications). All irrigation and reclaimed service shall be priced under nonresidential rates. 
    Bills will be issued to the party or parties who obtain service under the provisions of section 18-103 of this Code ("obtaining service"). Residential customers will have consolidated bills presented for other services including, but not limited to, wastewater, solid waste, and stormwater in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 
    Service pricing will be as either residential or nonresidential (commercial) as shown in appendix A as follows: 
A.  Residential is for a residential property owner whose property meets all the following criteria and will have water service provided and billed under residential rate provisions using residential rates: 
1.  The property is used as a detached single-family residential living unit by an owner or tenant and is intended to be used as a residential dwelling; and 
2.  The property is classified by the Williamson County Assessor as a residential or homebelt property; and 
3.  Is served by a single water meter serving a single residential living unit; and 
4.  The development consists primarily of similar units and not mixed-use or attached dwellings which are classified as "multi-residential". 
5.  The occupant (owner or tenant) has a unique utility service contract with the city or water district. An addendum to the water supply contract authorizes the city to provide and be paid for city provided services if served water from MVUD, Milcrofton, HB&TS or Brentwood (specific addendums are in their contracts for city services). 
B.  Multi-residential customers are those that live in residential living units containing the following characteristics. Service is priced at residential rates using "multiple minimums". Multiple minimums apply when more than one living unit is served from one water meter. This allows for water service to be priced as if each living unit were measured and billed separately. The effect is that total consumption is divided by total units to determine the pricing per unit and billed to the party contracting for service. Living units with one meter/unit will result in being priced as if they are residential. 
1.  The property is used as an attached or detached multi-family residential living unit by an owner or tenant and is intended to be used as residential dwellings; and 
2.  The property is classified by the Williamson County Assessor as a residential (condominiums, townhomes, duplexes, triplexes) or commercial property (apartments, duplexes, triplexes) or governmental property (Franklin Housing Authority); and 
3.  The development consists primarily of similar mixed-use or attached dwellings which are not classified as "residential" above. 
4.  The occupant (owner or tenant) typically does not have a utility service contract with the city or water district and the contract for service is typically with a commercial enterprise, an agent of the owner/tenant (e.g. an homeowner's association or property management firm) or a government entity (Franklin Housing Authority). An addendum to the water supply contract authorizes the city to provide and be paid for city provided services if served water from MVUD, Milcrofton, HB&TS or Brentwood (specific addendums are in their contracts for city services). 
C.  Nonresidential is a customer who does not meet the requirements as a residential or multi-residential customer but may have living units on the property. Included are farms, healthcare facilities, hospitals, assisted living facilities, hotels (including extended stay facilities) and common properties for residential and multi-residential developments. All "irrigation water" shall be classified as nonresidential even if delivered to a residential customer. Water pricing will be under nonresidential (commercial) rate provisions.

(2)  If in the opinion of the director or his designee, after appropriate inspection, any work inspected under the terms of this chapter fails to comply with the law, and notice is given to the permittee or his agent, and any reinspection of the same work is required, then a fee as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, per reinspection may be assessed against and collected from the permittee or his agent. No portion of the permitted work shall continue without first paying the reinspection fee. 
(3)  The city reserves the right to refuse service or to discontinue service to any premises not meeting standards fixed by city ordinances regulating building and plumbing, or not in accordance with any special contract, these rules and regulations, or other requirements of the city. 
(4)  Any failure to inspect or reject a customer's installation or plumbing system shall not render the city liable nor responsible for any loss or damage that might have been avoided, had such inspection or rejection been made.

The installation fee shall be paid within ten days after the service line or lines have been laid and before service is received by the customer. 
(c)  Connections to the public sanitary sewage system shall be made in accordance with the established standards of the city. The city shall be responsible for installing that portion of the service line from the sewer main to the customer's property line unless there is approval by the city for the customer or its agent to install that portion of the service line. When a service line is completed and accepted by the city as part of the public sewer system, the city shall be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of such service line from the main to the customer's property line and that portion of the line shall belong to the city. The remaining portion of the service line beyond the customer's property line and extending into the customer's property shall belong to and be the maintenance responsibility of the customer. Maintenance shall include repairs or corrections to correct infiltration or inflow of rainwater or groundwater. 
(d)  A separate and independent building sewer or service line shall be provided for every building. Except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and a service line cannot be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway, the building sewer service line from the building may be extended to the rear building and the whole is considered as one building sewer service line. 
(e)  In case application is made to connect multiple units (such as would be contained in a shopping center, trailer park, apartment complex, condominium, duplex, triplex, etc.) to the sanitary sewage system, no privilege shall be granted unless a wastewater impact fee as above set out is paid for each individual unit to be served within said development. 
(3)  Schedule of rates. Wastewater impact fees as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, will be assessed for any connection inside or outside the corporate limits and shall be based upon single-family unit equivalent (SFUE) of 350 gallons/day discharge. 
( Ord. No. 2018-26 , § I, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 18-207. - Wastewater impact fee. 
(1)  In order to provide additional funds for additions, replacements and improvements to the Franklin Wastewater System the city hereby establishes a wastewater impact fee, hereinafter referred to as the "impact fee." The impact fee shall be assessed to any person or entity connecting to the sanitary sewer lines or facilities of the city for furnishing sanitary sewer service to a new or expanded demands of residential or nonresidential sites. 
(2)  For the purposes of this section, the point of connection to the system shall be that point at which any new line or service tap is connected to an existing line in the Franklin Wastewater System. Such point may be remote from the site of the development or customer requiring service. 
(3)  The impact fee shall be based on the anticipated wastewater discharge for the development. Such anticipated discharge shall be determined by the director, and shall be based on the following: 
(a)  Information furnished to the director by the person or entity desiring to connect to the sewer lines or facilities; 
(b)  Information contained in recognized state or national publications; 
(c)  Records or similar installations; or 
(d)  Information supplied from other reliable sources approved by the director. 
(4)  The unit of measure shall be the single-family unit equivalent (SFUE) which shall be equivalent to a daily wastewater discharge of 350 gallons. 
(5)  The impact fee shall be no less than as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, per SFUE; however, an impact fee greater than the SFUE as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, for access to any specific section of a sewer main may be established by resolution of the board of mayor and aldermen upon recommendation of the appropriate committee. 
( Ord. No. 2018-26 , § I, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 18-208. - Main extensions or facilities funded in whole or in part by developers. 
    If a person has been required to pay all or a part of the cost of constructing wastewater lines and facilities (hereinafter "improvements"), which improvements become part of the Franklin Sewer System and are available for use and benefit of the customers of the Franklin Sewer System, that person may be eligible to be reimbursed a portion of its costs of construction of the said improvements. 
    Reimbursement shall be allowed only by the board of mayor and aldermen and shall be paid from revenue generated from the wastewater impact fee account or other source established by the board of mayor and aldermen. Cost reimbursement will not be allowed for improvements constructed, on or off-site, for the sole benefit of the development. Costs eligible for reimbursement include labor, equipment, supplies, materials, engineering design, supervision, inspection, legal, and acquisition costs for easements and right-of-way. Fiscal costs, including interest, finance charges, and other similar costs are ineligible for reimbursement. 
    The person requesting reimbursement must enter into a written agreement with the city prior to commencement of construction of any improvements for which reimbursement is sought. This agreement shall set out: 
(1)  A description of the improvements; 
(2)  The estimated total eligible costs, as above defined; 
(3)  The portion of the cost of such improvements for which reimbursement will be allowed. The latter determination shall be based generally upon the difference in sizing or capacity of the line or facility needed for the development and the size or capacity needed for the system as a whole. However, the board may in its reasonable discretion consider such other factors as are necessary for an equitable sharing of costs of any system improvements so constructed. 
    Further, prior to dedication and acceptance of the improvements by the city, the person requesting reimbursement must present to the board a detailed statement of the actual eligible costs and the board in its discretion may amend the agreement, and the reimbursement amount, to reflect the actual project costs. 
( Ord. No. 2018-26 , § I, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 18-209. - Construction of sewer lines. 
(1)  All persons who undertake the construction of sewer lines located in or affecting sanitary sewer service provided by the city shall comply with the requirements and regulations set forth in the "General Requirements and Technical Specifications, Water Management Department, City, Tennessee," latest edition, along with any amendments, additions, or alterations that may hereafter be adopted by the board of mayor and aldermen by resolution, or the latest edition thereof or amendment thereto, copies of which may be purchased in the office of the city recorder. 
(2)  Upon completion of the construction of any such wastewater line, and upon acceptance by the city, such wastewater lines and mains shall become the property of the city. The persons paying the cost of constructing such lines and the mains shall execute all written instruments required by the city that are necessary to provide evidence of the city's ownership of such lines and mains. In consideration of such lines and mains being transferred to the city, the city shall incorporate said mains as an integral part of the city's wastewater system and shall furnish sewer service therefrom in accordance with this chapter. 
(3)  When for cause shown, the board of mayor and aldermen determines that it is to the best interest of the wastewater system and the general public to extend sewer service, without requiring strict compliance with this section, such extension may be constructed upon such terms and conditions as shall be approved by a majority of the members of the board of mayor and alderman. 
(4)  The authority to extend wastewater service is permissive only, and nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the city to provide sewer service to any person or entity. 
( Ord. No. 2018-26 , § I, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 18-210. - Billing for sanitary sewer service. 
    All sewer bills may be rendered weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly, at the option of the city. 
    The bills will consist of charges for the user service fee, consisting of the availability charge, the customer service charge and the consumption service charge, as well as other services obtained by the customer from the city in accord with the agreement between the customer and the city. 
    The sewer service bill is based on gallons of water delivered by the water provider through the potable water meter. An availability charge applies if sewer is available, even if the customer has not connected to the sewer or there is no consumption for the period. 
    Sewer bills must be paid on or before the due date shown thereon to obtain the net or discount rate, otherwise the gross rate shall apply which includes a penalty of ten percent of the net amount billed for sewer. Failure to receive a bill will not release a customer from payment obligation, nor extend the due date. 
    In the event a bill is not paid on or before 15 days after the discount or due date, the customer's water service may be discontinued without further notice. The city shall not be liable for any damages resulting from discontinued service under the provisions of this section, even though payment of the bill is made at any time on the day that service is discontinued. 
    Should the final date of payment of bill at the net rate fall on a weekend or a holiday, the business day next following the final date will be the last day to obtain the net rate. 
    If a water meter fails to register properly, or if a meter is removed to be tested or repaired, or if water is received other than through a meter, the city reserves the right to render an estimated bill based on the best information available. Any unauthorized removal or tampering with the meter will result in a fine as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, per occurrence. 
    Any unauthorized removal or tampering with the water meter shall result in a remedial fine as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties. 
    The wastewater (sewer) service charge shall not apply to separately metered water and reclaimed water delivery points that are owned, maintained and read by the water provider where there is no potential for the wastewater stream of entering the wastewater stream (e.g. separately metered irrigation and cooling tower applications). 
    Bills will be issued to the party or parties who obtain service under the provisions of section 18-103 of this Code ("obtaining service"). Residential customers will have consolidated bills presented for other services including, but not limited to, wastewater, solid waste, and stormwater in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 
A.  Residential is for a residential property owner whose property meets all of the following criteria and will have water service provided and billed under residential rate provisions using residential rates: 
1.  The property is used as a detached single-family residential living unit by an owner or tenant and is intended to be used as a residential dwelling; and 
2.  The property is classified by the Williamson County Assessor as a residential or homebelt property; and 
3.  Is served by a single water meter serving a single residential living unit; and 
4.  The development consists primarily of similar units and not mixed-use or attached dwellings which are classified as "multi-residential". 
5.  The occupant (owner or tenant) has a unique utility service contract with the city or water district. An addendum to the water supply contract authorizes the city to provide and be paid for city provided services if served water from MVUD, Milcrofton, HB&TS or Brentwood (specific addendums are in their contracts for city services). 
B.  Multi-residential customers are those that live in residential living units containing the following characteristics. Service is priced at residential rates using "multiple minimums". Multiple minimums apply when more than one living unit is served from one water meter. This allows for water service to be priced as if each living unit were measured and billed separately. The effect is that total consumption is divided by total units to determine the pricing per unit and billed to the party contracting for service. Living units with one meter/unit will result in being priced as if they are residential. 
1.  The property is used as an attached or detached multi-family residential living unit by an owner or tenant and is intended to be used as residential dwellings; and 
2.  The property is classified by the Williamson County Assessor as a residential (condominiums, townhomes, duplexes, triplexes) or commercial property (apartments, duplexes, triplexes) or governmental property (Franklin Housing Authority); and 
3.  The development consists primarily of similar mixed-use or attached dwellings which are not classified as "residential" above. 
4.  The occupant (owner or tenant) typically does not have a utility service contract with the city or water district and the contract for service is typically with a commercial enterprise, an agent of the owner/tenant (e.g., a homeowner's association or property management firm) or a government entity (Franklin Housing Authority). An addendum to the water supply contract authorizes the city to provide and be paid for city provided services if served water from MVUD, Milcrofton, HB&TS or Brentwood (specific addendums are in their contracts for city services). 
C.  Nonresidential is a customer who does not meet the requirements as a residential or multi-residential customer but may have living units on the property. Included are farms, healthcare facilities, hospitals, assisted living facilities, hotels (including extended stay facilities) and common properties for residential and multi-residential developments. All "irrigation water" shall be classified as nonresidential even if delivered to a residential customer. Water pricing will be under nonresidential (commercial) rate provisions.

(d)  No waste from garbage disposals shall be discharged into the POTW's sewers except from private garbage disposals used in an individual residence or upon permit issued by the director for preparation of food consumed on premises, and then only when applicable fees are paid. It shall be unlawful for any person to use a garbage disposal grinder connected to the sewer system for grinding and discharging plastic, paper products, inert materials, or anything other than the waste products from normal food preparation and consumption. 
(e)  Any ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, paunch, manure, or any substance capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, capable of coating the sewers or other appurtenances, or causing other interferences with the proper operation of the sewage works. 
(f)  Any water or waste having a pH lower than 6.0 or higher than 10.0 or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and personnel of the sewage works. 
(g)  Any water and waste containing a toxic or poisonous substance in amounts exceeding standards established by the environmental protection agency pursuant to section 307(a) (b) or (c) of the Act. 
(h)  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration that they do not comply with regulations or orders issued by the appropriate authority having control over their use or which may be hazardous to plant facilities or personnel. 
(i)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(j)  Any water or waste containing a pollutant capable of causing a pass-through violation at the POTW or an interference with the operation or performance of the POTW. 
(k)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points specified by the POTW. 
(l)  Any waste known or suspected of being infectious without first undergoing pretreatment to eliminate such pathogens. 
(5)  Regulated wastewater. 
(a)  Wastes having any of the following characteristics may be accepted only under such conditions and/or limitations as may be approved on a case-by-case basis by the director. 
(i)  Any waters or wastes containing constituents in excess of the following concentrations: 
BOD 300 mg/l COD 600 mg/l TKN  60 mg/l NH 3 -N  30 mg/l TSS 300 mg/l Oil and Grease 100 mg/l  
(ii)  Intermittent slugs, or short-time-high volume discharges, at such discharge rates or concentrations as to overload either the public sewers or the treatment facilities. 
(iii)  Any waters or wastes having noxious or malodorous substances which either alone or in combination with other substances which may be present in the wastewater may cause an offensive odor or public nuisance. 
(iv)  Any waters or wastes having color which is not removed by the treatment processes or which could adversely affect plant appearance or performance. 
(b)  Restrictions on wastewater strength. No person or user shall discharge wastewater which exceeds the following set of standards (Table A - user discharge restrictions) unless an exception is permitted as provided for in this chapter or the user's wastewater discharge permit provides a special permit condition temporarily allowing a higher concentration level in conjunction with a requirement that the user construct a pretreatment facility or institute changes in operation and maintenance procedures to reduce the concentration of pollutants to levels not exceeding the standards set forth in the table within a predetermined time frame (compliance schedule).

may be accepted in the public sewer subject to a surcharge to cover the additional cost of treating such wastes. Discharges of extra strength wastes must apply for and operate under a permit from the city. The surcharges will be based on the average of six composite samples collected over a three-month period, at least one of which should have been collected within 30 days of billing date. The director will use independent sampling, split samples, or other means to verify the constituents of the wastewater. 
(b)  The surcharge shall be based on the average concentration and the metered water consumption (or wastewater flows). 
(c)  The surcharge will be calculated according to the following formula with no credit for concentrations less than the threshold concentration amounts listed in paragraph (a) above and with the total applied to the monthly bill of affected users: 
[A(E-300) + B(F-300) + C(G-60) + D(H-100) × 0.00834 × I × J = SURCHARGE MONTHLY BILL and where: 
A is the surcharge rate for BOD of $0.35 per pound; 
B is the surcharge rate for TSS of $0.35 per pound; 
C is the surcharge rate for TKN of $1.75 per pound; 
D is the surcharge rate for oil and grease of $1.05 per pound; 
E is the user's effluent BOD concentration (mg/l); 
F is the user's effluent TSS concentration (mg/l); 
G is the user's effluent TKN concentration (mg/l); 
H is the user's effluent oil and grease concentration (mg/l); 
I is the user's flow to the sewer system in 1,000 gallons per day; 
J is the number of days in the billing month.

The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principle executive, general partner, or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued. 
(d)  Compliance order. When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or permit or order issued hereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge, directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued and/or civil penalties will be assessed unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements deemed reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, the director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do one of the following: 
(i)  Comply with the order. 
(ii)  Take the appropriate remedial or preventive action needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
(f)  Emergency termination of service.

On request, the owner, lessee, or occupant of any property so served shall furnish any pertinent information regarding piping system on such property. The refusal of such information or refusal of access, when requested, shall be deemed evidence of the presence of cross-connections. The city may also employ an independent contractor to perform inspection and testing of back-flow prevention devices under this section and may pass the cost of such inspection and testing on to the customer as part of the customer's monthly water bill. Any such independent contractor shall have the same authority, as would a city employee to enter onto any property at reasonable times to perform such inspections. 
(1976 Code, § 8-305; Ord. No. 2001-56, 4- -2002; Ord. No. 2005-66, 10- -2005; Ord. No. 2005-72, 4- -2006; Ord. No. 2010-62, § XIX, 11-23-2010) 
Sec. 18-306. - Correction of violation. 
    Any person who has a cross-connection, auxiliary intake, bypass, or interconnection in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be allowed a reasonable time within which to correct the violation. After a thorough investigation of existing conditions and an appraisal of time required to complete the work, the amount of time shall be designated by the director. 
    The failure to correct conditions threatening the safety of the public water system as prohibited by this chapter and the Tennessee Code Annotated, § 68-221-711, within a reasonable time and within the time limits set by the director, shall be grounds for denial of water service. If proper protection has not been provided after a reasonable time, the director shall give the customer legal notification that water service is to be discontinued, and physically separate the public water system from the customer's on-site piping system in such a manner that the two systems cannot again be connected by an unauthorized person. 
    Where cross-connections, interconnections, auxiliary intakes, or bypasses are found that constitute an extreme hazard of immediate concern for contaminating the public water system, the director shall require that immediate corrective action be taken to eliminate the threat to the public water system. Immediate steps shall be taken to disconnect the public water system from the on-site piping system unless the imminent hazard is corrected immediately. 
(1976 Code, § 8-306; Ord. No. 2001-56, 4- -2002) 
Sec. 18-307. - Required protective device. 
    Where the nature of use of the water supplied to a premises by the water system is such that it is deemed: 
(1)  Impractical to provide an effective air-gap separation; 
(2)  The owner or occupant of the premises cannot, or is not willing to, demonstrate to the director or his designated representative that the water use and protective features of the plumbing are such as to pose no threat to the safety or potability of the water; 
(3)  The nature and mode of operation within a premises are such that frequent alterations are made to the plumbing; or 
(4)  There is a likelihood that protective measures may be subverted, altered, or disconnected, then the director shall require the use of an approved protective device on the service line serving the premises to assure that any contamination that may originate in the customer's premises is contained therein. The protective devices shall be a reduced pressure zone type backflow preventer approved by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation as to manufacture, model, and size. The method of installation of backflow protective devices shall be approved by the director prior to installation and shall comply with the criteria set forth by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. The installation shall be at the expense of the owner or occupant of the premises. 
    Personnel of the Franklin Water System shall have the right to inspect and test the device on an annual basis or whenever deemed necessary by the director. Water service shall not be disrupted to test the device without the knowledge of the occupant of the premises. 
    Where the use of water is critical to the continuance of normal operations or protection of life, property, or equipment, duplicate units shall be provided to avoid the necessity of discontinuing water service to test or repair the protective device. Where it is found that only one unit has been installed and the continuance of service is critical, the director shall notify, in writing, the occupant of the premises of plans to discontinue water service and arrange for a mutually acceptable time to test or repair the device. The director shall require the occupant or owner of the premises to make all repairs indicated promptly and to keep any protective device working properly. The expense of such repairs shall be borne by the owner or occupant of the premises. Repairs shall be made by qualified personnel acceptable to the director. 
    The failure to maintain a backflow prevention device in proper working order shall be grounds for discontinuing water service to a premises. The removal, bypassing, or altering of a protective device, or the installation thereof, so as to render a device ineffective shall constitute grounds for discontinuance of water service. Water service to such premises shall not be restored until the customer has corrected or eliminated such conditions or defects to the satisfaction of the director.

CHAPTER 4. - RECLAIMED WATER 

Sec. 18-401. - Use of system regulated. 
    All persons using, desiring, or required to use the reclaimed water system of the City of Franklin, Tennessee shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and all other provisions in this Code relating to the public water and sanitary sewerage system of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2003-54, 2- -2004) 
Sec. 18-402. - Purposes, objectives and application. 
    The provisions contained in this chapter of the Franklin Municipal Code set forth uniform requirements which regulate the use of the reclaimed water system. 
(Ord. No. 2003-54, 2- -2004) 
Sec. 18-403. - Approved uses of reclaimed water. 
    Sites may use reclaimed water for a variety of uses approved by the City of Franklin. These include, but are not limited to: landscape irrigation, agricultural irrigation, construction water, water for industrial purposes, impoundment (fountains) and indoor toilet and urinal flushing. Each use of reclaimed water must have a permit from the city prior to receiving reclaimed water. The City of Franklin, at their discretion, can require or specify what sites and/or uses of reclaimed water are to be utilized in their service area. Sites may use reclaimed water only for those uses approved by the City of Franklin and State of Tennessee. The design and operation of the reclaimed water system shall be in accordance with the "Policies and Procedures for the Design and Operation of Reclaimed Water Facilities" as adopted by the City of Franklin. 
(Ord. No. 2003-54, 2- -2004) 
Sec. 18-404. - Requirement for the development of reclaimed water system. 
    A reclaimed water system may be required in developments with more than five acres or ten building units and in developments with mandatory landscaping requirements. The potential amount of reclaimed water used by the development and the location of the development in relation to the Franklin reclaimed water system will be the criteria used to determine whether a reclaimed water system will be required for the development. In general, developments that use 7,500 gallons per day or more of reclaimed water (as determined by floor/area ratio and greenspace irrigation requirements) and are located within 1,000 feet of an existing reclaimed water system will be required to install a reclaimed water system. 
    All developments subject to these requirements shall submit to the Franklin Water Management Department an estimate of the potential water reuse quantities within the proposed development (in conjunction with the site plan submittal to the planning and sustainability department). A designated representative of the Franklin Water Management Department shall determine the extent of the reclaimed water system to be installed in the proposed development. 
    Proposed development required to install a reclaimed water system shall be responsible for extending the reclaimed water system to the project site (i.e. extending water/sewer lines), if the city's reclaimed water system is within 1,000 feet of the proposed project/development. If the proposed development is located more than 1,000 feet from the existing reclaimed water system, and the water management department requires the developer to install a reclaimed water system, the City of Franklin may extend the reclaimed water system to within 1000 feet of the proposed development. The development shall be eligible to request cost reimbursement pursuant to the provisions of title 18 of the Franklin Municipal Code. 
    If it is determined by the Franklin Water Management Department the development is required to install a reclaimed water system, dual water systems (potable water and reclaimed water) shall be installed in the development, regardless of whether reclaimed water is currently available in the area. When reclaimed water is available to the site, the Franklin Water Management Department will be responsible for connecting the reclaimed water to the development's reclaimed water system. 
(Ord. No. 2003-54, 2- -2004; Memo of 12-3-2013) 
Sec. 18-405. - Reclaimed water use permit. 
    Every site must obtain a reclaimed water permit from the City of Franklin prior to receiving reclaimed water. Permits will only be issued after the site has met all of the permit conditions. If in the opinion of the director of water and wastewater or his designee, after appropriate inspection, any work inspected under the terms of this chapter fails to comply with the law, and notice is given to the applicant or his agent, and any reinspection of the same work is required, then a fee as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties, per reinspection may be assessed against and collected from the applicant or his agent. No portion of the permitted work shall continue without first paying the reinspection fee.

CHAPTER 1. - JUVENILE CURFEW 

Sec. 20-101. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Juvenile Curfew Ordinance." 
(1976 Code, § 12-601) 
Sec. 20-102. - Definitions. 
    For purpose of this chapter the following terms, phrases, or words used in the present tense include the future, words in the plural number include the singular and words in the singular include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory. 
(1)  City is the City of Franklin, Tennessee. 
(2)  Minor or juvenile is any unemancipated person under the age of 18 or, in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, any person 17 years or less. 
(3)  Parent is any person having legal custody of a minor. 
(a)  As a natural or adoptive parent; 
(b)  As a legal guardian; or 
(c)  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the court. 
(4)  Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregation of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exemptions are expressly defined in § 20-103 so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presence type curfew chapter. 
(5)  Street is a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel. 
(6)  Time, whether Central Standard Time or Central Daylight Savings Time, is the time generally observed at that hour by the public in the city, prima facie the time when observed in the city administrative offices and police department. 
(7)  Year of age continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth, to (but not including the day of) the next, making it clear that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of age," unless specifically defined differently herein. 
(8)  The police department shall refer to the Police Department of the City of Franklin, Tennessee. 
(9)  Public place shall refer to any street, alley, avenue, highway, road, curb area, sidewalk, park, playground, or place to which the general public has access and a right to resort for business, entertainment, or other lawful purpose. A public place shall include but not be limited to any store, shop, restaurant, tavern, bowling alley, cafe, theater, drug store, pool room, shopping center, and any other place devoted to amusement or entertainment of the general public. It shall also include the front or immediate area of the above. 
(10)  Emergency means an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action. The term includes, but is not limited to, a fire, a natural disaster, or an automobile accident, or any situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury or loss of life. 
(11)  Serious bodily injury means bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or impairment of the function, of any bodily member or organ.

    It shall further be unlawful for a parent of a minor to knowingly permit or by inefficient or insufficient control allow such minor to be or remain in any public place within the city under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, curfew chapter. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor child. 
(1976 Code, § 12-603) 
Sec. 20-104. - Exceptions. 
    It shall be a valid exception to the operation of the curfew if the minor was:

(2)  Accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area; 
(3)  Legally employed, for the period from 45 after work, while going directly between his or her home and place of employment without any stop or detour. This exception shall also apply if the minor is in a public place during curfew hours in the course of his or her employment. To come within this exception, the minor must be carrying a written statement of employment issued by employer; 
(4)  On the property of or the sidewalk directly adjacent to the place where such minor resides or the place immediately adjacent thereto if the owner of the adjacent building does not communicate an objection to the minor and the police officer; 
(5)  Returning home by a direct route from (and within 45 minutes of the termination of) a school activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary association or a place of public entertainment, such as a movie, play or sporting event. This exception will not apply beyond 1:30 A.M. If the event is not commercial in nature or does not have a fixed, public known time at which it will or does end, the sponsoring organization must register the event with the chief of police (or his assigned representative) at least 24 hours in advance, informing the police department of the time such event is scheduled to begin, the place at which it shall be held, the time at which is shall end and the name of the sponsoring organization; 
(6)  In the case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent has communicated to the police department personnel the facts establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including place or origin and destination. A copy of such communication, or the police record thereof, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and addresses of such parent and minor shall constitute evidence of qualification under this exception; 
(7)  Exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly; 
(8)  With parental consent in a motor vehicle engaged in a bona fide interstate travel through the city, particularly on Interstate 65, 24, and 40, and all access roads to these interstate systems. This also exempts all interstate travel beginning or ending in the city; and

(10)  Married or had been married or had disability of minority removed in accordance with Tennessee law; 
(11)  Each of the foregoing exemptions, and their several limitations, such as provisions for notification, are severable. 
(1976 Code, § 12-604) 
Sec. 20-105. - Enforcement. 
(1)  A police officer of the city who has probable cause to believe that a minor is in violation of this chapter shall: 
(a)  Ascertain the name and address of the minor; 
(b)  Issue the minor a written warning that the minor is in violation of this chapter; and 
(c)  Order the minor to go promptly home by a direct route. 
(2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this section a police officer who has probable cause to believe that a minor is in violation of this chapter, shall transport the minor to the police department if: 
(a)  The minor has received one previous written warning for violation of this chapter; or 
(b)  Reasonable grounds exist to believe the minor has engaged in delinquent conduct. 
(c)  When a minor is taken to the police department, the minor's parents shall be immediately contacted. If after this contact there is still probable cause to believe that the minor was violating this chapter, the minor shall be held until the parent comes to take the minor home. When the parent arrives, he or she shall be given a copy of this chapter, if no parent has arrived within two hours, the minor shall be turned over to custody of the local juvenile authorities until a parent can take custody of him or her. 
(3)  In case of a second violation by a minor, the chief of police shall, by certified mail, send to the minor's parent written notice of said violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in a full enforcement of the curfew chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. Said notice shall be sent to the minor's parent at his or her last known address and evidence of its mailing by certified mail shall constitute sufficient notice of the minor's violation. 
(4)  If after the mailing of the warning notice set forth in subsection (3) herein of a second violation by a minor, a parent violates section 20-103 (in connection with a third violation by a minor), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental offense a parent shall be fined as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties. For each subsequent offense by a parent the fine shall be increased as specified in appendix A, comprehensive fees and penalties. 
(1976 Code, § 12-605; Ord. No. 2009-67, § I, 12-8-2009) 
Sec. 20-106. - Construction of severability. 
    Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of the Curfew Chapter. If any provision, including inter alia any exception, part phrase or term of the application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. The board of mayor and aldermen does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible to execute or unreasonable. It is intended that the Curfew Chapter be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall be given. The board of mayor and aldermen does not intend to violate the Constitution of the State of Tennessee or the Constitution of the United States of America. 
(1976 Code, § 12-606) 
Sec. 20-107. - Continuing evaluation. 
    The board of mayor and aldermen will continue its evaluation and updating of this Curfew Chapter through methods including, but not limited to: 
    Within six months after the implementation of this chapter, the chief of police shall provide the board of mayor and aldermen with a report concerning the effect of this chapter on crimes committed by and against minors, and of the number of warnings issued and arrest of minors and parents hereunder, and such other information as the board of mayor and aldermen may request. 
    After receipt of the police chief's report to the board the city recorder shall place this matter on the board agenda for discussion, review, and continuing its evaluation. 
(1976 Code, § 12-607)

Sec. 20-109. - Chapter cumulative. 
    This chapter shall be cumulative and in addition to any other laws in force. 
(1976 Code, § 12-610)

    Unless it is apparent from the context that another meaning is intended, the following words when used in this chapter shall have the meanings indicated herein: 
(1)  Alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, arranged to signal the police department that an emergency exists and the police department is needed.

(i)  An engineer shall stamp all proposed plans for construction in the city. This shall include all proposed improvements or modifications to the existing or new stormwater infrastructure, erosion prevention and sediment control practices, and other related improvements or modifications. 
(c)  Stormwater master plan. Each individual project shall be evaluated for consistency with the master stormwater management plan for the major watershed or watersheds within which the project site is located. The individual project evaluation will determine if stormwater quantity and quality management practices can adequately serve the property and limit impacts to downstream public and private properties. The presence of a regional facility(s) will be considered in determining the extent to which quantity and/or quality controls will be necessary. 
(i)  In the absence of such a stormwater quantity and/or quality master plan, a system of uniform requirements shall be applied to each individual project site. In general, these uniform requirements will be based on the criteria that post-development stormwater peak runoff, volume over the critical design-storm period, and water quality must not differ significantly from pre-development conditions. These criteria shall be included in the stormwater management plan for the site. 
(d)  Peak runoff control. Peak runoff control facilities for new development and redevelopment shall be designed to address the rate at which flow is released over the entire runoff discharge period and the volume of discharge over the critical design-storm period. This shall be applied for two- , five-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year 24-hour storm peak discharge rate not to exceed the pre-development (or undisturbed natural conditions) discharge rate. 
(i)  Calculation of peak runoff flow. Acceptable methodologies for computing pre- and post-development conditions shall include: 
A.  The rational method (used when the drainage area is 25 acres or less). 
B.  The peak discharge method as described in USDA Technical Release Number 55 (TR-55) (drainage area is 2,000 acres or less). 
(ii)  Peak runoff flow requirements. If the total land disturbance area is less than 50 percent of the property, then peak runoff control shall be required for the disturbed area only. If the total land disturbance area is greater than 50 percent of the property, then peak runoff control shall be required for the entire site area. 
(iii)  Redevelopment of property without existing detention shall be evaluated using one of the following methods unless otherwise determined by the city engineer:

(ii)  All new development and redevelopment shall be designed and graded so that a minimum ten-foot drainage easement and stormwater conveyance exist between each property. 
(iii)  All new development and redevelopment shall be designed to provide a minimum 20-foot drainage easement on all stormwater infrastructure, including channels, serving more than two properties. 
(g)  Erosion prevention and sediment control. All construction sites regardless of size or disturbed area shall follow proper EP&SC practices to control unwarranted sediment from leaving a site. All construction sites receiving grading or stormwater permits from the City of Franklin shall be subject to the requirements outlined in the State of Tennessee's Construction General Permit, EP&SC Handbook, the city stormwater BMP Manual, and this title (whichever is more stringent), including the following: 
(i)  Construction shall only be permitted after temporary or permanent EP&SC management practices have been placed or constructed and are operational to the city's satisfaction, and a grading and/or stormwater permit has been issued and signed by the city stormwater inspector. 
(ii)  The design-storm for EP&SC practices shall be as described in the City of Franklin Stormwater BMP Manual or the Tennessee EP&SC Handbook and consistent with the Tennessee Construction General Permit. 
(iii)  The city may require more stringent EP&SC practices on properties adjacent to water resources with unavailable parameters, or within watersheds with water resources with unavailable parameters, watersheds with TMDLs, or sites in close proximity to water resources. This may include measures that limit or eliminate, with a greater safety factor, the potential for sediment or other forms of water pollution from entering sensitive areas as designated by TDEC or the city engineer. 
(iv)  Unwarranted acceleration of erosion or sedimentation, or transport of other pollutants or forms of pollution, due to various land development activities shall be controlled. 
(v)  If deemed appropriate, the city may require the addition, removal, or modification of EP&SC measures and/or EP&SC locations at any time during the construction process to ensure proper EP&SC performance. 
(vi)  The city may impose enforcement actions outlined in section 23-111 of this title if any site, development, or construction is found to be in violation of this title or the State of Tennessee's Construction General Permit in order to achieve EP&SC compliance. 
(vii)  The design-storm for erosion prevention and sediment control practices shall be as described in the City of Franklin Stormwater BMP Manual and consistent with the Tennessee General Construction Permit. 
(viii)  Inlet protection shall be specified on all construction plans to include an overflow protection device. Other measures may be approved on a case by case basis by the city engineer. 
(h)  Floodplain alterations. 
(i)  Floodplain alterations or filling shall not cause a net decrease in flood storage capacity below the projected 100-year flood elevation unless it is shown that the proposed alteration or filling will not cause an increase in the high-water level, increase velocities, or aggravate flooding on other properties and will not unduly restrict flood flows. Compensatory cut shall at least be applied to 150 percent (1.5:1) for all fill in floodplains. Floodplain may be used for application of water quality devices. This may only be permitted provided EP&SC, water quality, and cut-fill policies are adequately addressed as determined by the city engineer according to the provisions in section 23-110 of this title. Detention/retention volumes in the floodplain shall count as fill if applied in a manner where floodplain storage is lost. 
(i)  General stormwater regulations. 
(i)  The city encourages regional stormwater management practices, serving 40 to 300 acres of tributary area, which may be consistently and efficiently managed and maintained. These types of practices will be encouraged to replace or reduce the implementation of on-site stormwater management practices redevelopment of properties containing on-site stormwater management practices may be permitted, at the discretion of the city engineer, provided the property and downstream public and private properties, infrastructure or waters of the state are adequately protected by a regional facility(s) from stormwater quantity or quality impacts. 
(ii)  No construction, whether by private or public action, shall be performed in a manner that will negatively impact stormwater quantity or quality in its vicinity or in other areas whether by flow restrictions, increased runoff, or by diminishing channel or floodplain storage capacity. 
(iii)  New construction shall not aggravate upstream or downstream flooding. Existing downstream or upstream problems may be required to be corrected in conjunction with new development or redevelopment. 
(iv)  In no instance shall new development or redevelopment cause or have the potential to cause water quality degradation to immediate or downstream water resources. 
(v)  The construction and financing of any required off-site drainage improvement necessitated by private development within the same watershed shall be the responsibility of the developer. 
(vi)  Under no circumstances shall a site be graded or drained in such a way as to increase surface runoff to sinkholes, dry wells, or drainage wells. 
(vii)  Soil bioengineering, "green" and other "soft" slope and stream bank stabilization methods shall receive preference over riprap, concrete, and other hard armoring techniques. "Hard" alternatives shall only be permitted when their necessity can be demonstrated given site-specific conditions. 
(viii)  The city may require maintenance or modification of stormwater management practices that are not operating within the guidelines established by this title, as determined by the city engineer. 
(ix)  The city encourages the use of greenway rights-of-way for appropriate properties. 
(x)  As new development construction is completed, an "as-built" plan, certified by an engineer and/or land surveyor as appropriate, must be submitted upon completion of the stormwater management facilities included in the stormwater management plan. The licensed professional shall certify that: the facilities have been constructed as shown on the "as-built" plan, and facilities meet the approved stormwater management plan and specifications, or achieve the function for which they were designed. Coordinate data shall be presented in the State of Tennessee Plane System with the North American Datum 1983 (NAD83) and North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. (as added by Ord. No. 2001-53, 2002). 
(j)  Maintenance responsibility. 
(i)  Any stormwater management facility or BMP which services individual property owners or subdivisions shall be privately owned with general routine maintenance (controlling vegetative grown and removing debris) provided for by the owner(s). The owner shall maintain a perpetual, non-exclusive easement, which allows for access for inspection and other maintenance by the city. 
(ii)  Any stormwater management facility or BMP which services an individual subdivision in which the facility or BMP is within designated open areas or an amenity with an established homeowners' association shall be privately owned and maintained consistent with provisions of this title. The owner shall maintain a perpetual, nonexclusive easement, which allows for access for inspection and emergency maintenance by the city.

The stormwater user fee for those properties utilizing city utilities is part of a consolidated statement for utility customers, which is generally paid by a single payment. In the event that a partial payment is received, the payment shall be applied pro-rata to each account billed on the consolidated statement in the proportion that an individual account bears to the total consolidated statement of all current charges for all accounts. The stormwater user fee for unmetered property shall be billed at regular intervals. All bills for stormwater user fees shall become due and payable in accordance with the rules and regulations of the utilities department pertaining to the collection of the stormwater user fees. 
( Ord. No. 2017-41 , § I, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 23-204. - Stormwater user fee determination. 
    There is hereby established the following uniform schedule of rates for the services and use of facilities of the stormwater management system by the owner, tenant, or occupant of the premises using the services and facilities of said system: 
(a)  The board of mayor and aldermen, upon recommendation of the city engineer, shall, by resolution, establish reasonable rates for the use of the system for each single-family residence: each single-family residence shall be billed at a flat fee established by the board of mayor and aldermen for an equivalent residential unit (ERU). 
(b)  Parcels which are undeveloped shall be assessed a stormwater user fee. The bill shall be determined by dividing the total land area of the property, in square feet, by the area of an equivalent residential unit times a correction factor. The correction factor shall be based on the relative volume of runoff from an undeveloped property and that of a typical single-family residence, under typical hydrologic conditions. 
(c)  For all nonresidential properties, that is enterprise, business establishment, building, or other occupancy not covered by subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the ERU rate shall be computed based on the total impervious area of the property divided by the average impervious area of an ERU times the rate established for an ERU. The billing amount shall be updated by the city engineer based on any additions to the impervious areas as approved through the building permit process. 
(d)  Users whose stormwater runoff is not discharged into or through the stormwater and/or flood control facilities of the city shall be exempt from paying the stormwater user fee. 
(e)  Users who construct, or have constructed, facilities to retain and control the quantity and/or quality of stormwater runoff from their property may be entitled to a reduction or adjustment of the stormwater user fee due, based upon reasonable criteria developed by the city engineer. 
(f)  Any person who disagrees with the calculation of the stormwater user fee's determination by the city engineer or who seeks adjustments or exemption of his stormwater user fee, may appeal such determination to the city engineer. An appeal shall be accompanied by a fee as specified in appendix A-Comprehensive fees and penalties, chapter 23-Stormwater management ordinance, filed in writing and include a written statement of the grounds for the appeal, with reference to the Franklin Stormwater Management Credit and Appeal Manual or other appropriate documents available from the engineering department. The city engineer will review the appeal and render a decision within 30 days. The city engineer's decision shall be in writing and mailed, certified return receipt requested, or hand-delivered to the address of the applicant contained in the appeal. In response to an appeal, the city engineer may adjust the stormwater user fee applicable to a property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this title. 
( Ord. No. 2017-41 , § I, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 23-205. - Equivalent residential unit (ERU) established. 
    The equivalent residential unit is hereby established to be 3,350 square feet of impervious area. 
( Ord. No. 2017-41 , § I, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 23-206. - Equivalent residential unit (ERU) rate and tiers established. 
(1)  Intent. The board of mayor and aldermen intends to establish a base ERU rate and tiers of residential properties so that application of the ERU rate and tiers as established leads to a fair and equitable result and such that the collection of fees shall be proportional to the amount of actual use of the stormwater management system. The fee structure reflects different categories of use and tiers using commonly accepted statistical principles to achieve such equitable results. 
(2)  ERU rate established. The ERU rate to be charged for the stormwater user fee for each ERU is as specified in appendix A-Comprehensive fees and penalties, chapter 23-Stormwater management ordinance. 
(a)  Two tier residential ERU established. Residential properties will be separated into two tiers: residential units smaller than or equal to 3,350 square feet will pay 75 percent of the ERU rate per month and residential units larger than 3,350 square feet will pay 120 percent of the ERU rate per month. 
(b)  Non-residential properties established. Non-residential properties will pay monthly the ERU rate times the actual square footage of impervious area divided by the ERU. 
( Ord. No. 2017-41 , § I, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 23-207. - Undisturbed property correction factor established. 
    The undisturbed property correction factor to be used to calculate the stormwater user fee for each acre of undisturbed property is hereby established to be zero percent.

Sec. 23-303. - General duties of the SAB. 
    In addition to any other duty or responsibility otherwise conferred upon the SAB by this title, the SAB shall have the duty and power as follows: 
(1)  To recommend from time to time to the board of mayor and aldermen that it amend or modify the provisions of this title;

( Ord. No. 2017-41 , § I, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 23-304. - Variances. 
(1)  The SAB may grant a variance from the requirements in this title, provided to do so would not result in the violation of any state or federal law or regulation and if exceptional circumstances applicable to the site exist such that strict adherence to the provisions of this title will result in unnecessary hardship and will not result in a condition contrary to the intent of the title. 
(2)  The appellant shall submit a written request containing specific justifications, and any other information necessary to the city engineer for the variance request. The city engineer shall conduct a review of the request for a variance within 25 working days after receipt and may either support the petition or may object to the petition. The city engineer may require additional information or an independent third party study or design analysis. If the city engineer objects to the variance, the reasons therefore shall be stated. If the petition for variance is supported by the city engineer no action shall be required by the SAB. Petitions for variances that are objected to by the city engineer shall be heard by the SAB. Once the city engineer's review is complete or the 25 working days for review have expired, the petition shall be subject to SAB action at the next regularly scheduled meeting or at a special meeting called at the discretion of the chair if needed. 
(3)  Variance requests shall be reviewed by the city engineer and/or SAB and may be granted using the following criteria: 
(a)  Those projects or activities where it can be demonstrated that strict compliance with the ordinance would result in practical difficulty. Each of the following criteria must be satisfied to show practical difficulty: 
i.  The problem is not self-created. 
ii.  The situation of the landowner is due to the unique conditions of the property. A unique condition is a condition that is peculiar to the subject property that relates to a physical aspect of the subject property. 
iii.  Compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions governing physical requirements such as lot area, setbacks, and lot coverage unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. 
(b)  Those projects or activities serving a public need where no feasible alternative is available. 
(c)  The repair and maintenance of public improvements where avoidance and minimization of adverse impacts to water resources have been addressed. 
(d)  Other considerations, such as: 
i.  The proximity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility. 
ii.  The relationship of the proposed use to the Franklin Zoning Ordinance, comprehensive land use plan, and master drainage plans for that area. 
iii.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
iv.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such a sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
v.  Whether issuance of a variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the character and design of a historic building or feature. 
(e)  In approving a variance, the city engineer and/or SAB may impose conditions on the approval. The conditions shall be identified in the variance approval. 
(f)  The decisions of the SAB shall be final and conclusive. 
(4)  Effect of a variance. The issuance of a variance shall authorize only the particular variation that is approved. A variance, including any conditions, shall run with the land and shall not be affected by a change in ownership. 
(5)  Subsequent development. Development authorized by the variance shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other approvals required by this title or any other applicable local, state, or federal law or regulation. A variance shall not ensure that the development feature approved as a variance shall receive subsequent approval for other applications for development approval unless the relevant and applicable portions of this title's other applicable provisions are met. 
(6)  Time limit. Unless otherwise specified in the variance, an application for a stormwater and/or grading permit shall be applied for and approved within one year of the date of the variance approval; the city engineer shall have the authority to extend this time limit for one year as long as significant changes have not occurred in site design or water quality impacts. Following the expiration of these dates the variance shall become invalid. Permitted time frames do not change with successive owners. 
( Ord. No. 2017-41 , § I, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 23-305. - Meetings; quorum. 
(1)  The SAB shall hold regular monthly meetings as needed, but no less than twice per calendar year, and such special meetings as the SAB may find necessary. 
(2)  Four members of the SAB shall constitute a quorum. A concurring vote of a majority of the voting members present shall be necessary to deny or grant any appeal or variance. 
(3)  The SAB meetings, deliberations, and records shall be open to the public. The SAB may elect to provide for public comment on relevant issues. 
( Ord. No. 2017-41 , § I, 9-12-2017)

(1)  When to be held. The SAB shall schedule an adjudicatory hearing to resolve disputed questions of fact and law whenever provided by any provision of this title or regulations. 
(2)  Record of hearing. At any such hearing, all testimony presented shall be under oath or upon solemn affirmation in lieu of oath. The SAB shall make a record of such hearing, but the same need not be a verbatim record. Any party coming before the SAB shall have the right to have such hearing recorded stenographically, but in such event the record need not be transcribed unless any party seeks judicial review of the order or action of the SAB by common law writ of certiorari, and in such event the parties seeking such judicial review shall pay for the transcription and provide the SAB with the original of the transcript so that it may be certified to court. 
(3)  Subpoenas. The chair may issue subpoenas requiring attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence, or both. A request for issuance of a subpoena shall be made by lodging with the chair at least ten days prior to the scheduled hearing date a written request for a subpoena setting forth the name and address of the party to be subpoenaed and identifying any evidence to be produced. Upon endorsement of a subpoena by the chair, the same shall be delivered to the chief of police for service by any police officer of the city, if the witness resides within the city. If the witness does not reside in the city, the chair shall issue a written request that the witness attend the hearing.

Rebuttal witnesses shall be called in the same order. The chair shall rule on any evidentiary questions arising during such hearing and shall make such other rulings as may be necessary or advisable to facilitate an orderly hearing subject to approval of the SAB. The SAB, the city engineer, or his designee, and all parties shall have the right to examine the witness. The SAB shall not be bound by or limited to rules of evidence applicable to legal procedures. 
(5)  Appeal to city engineer's order. Any person aggrieved by any order or determination of the city engineer may appeal said order or determination to the SAB and have such order or determination reviewed by the SAB under the provisions of this title. The appellant shall have 30 days to petition the SAB in order to appeal the city engineer's decision. A written notice of appeal shall be filed with the city engineer, and such notice shall set forthwith particularity the action or inaction of the city engineer complained of and the relief sought by the person filing said appeal. A payment of $750.00 shall accompany this appeal, and the payment shall cover the cost of court reporters, transcripts, plan reviews, and other administrative costs associated with the appeal, and may be refunded to the appellant by the SAB in the event the decision of the city engineer is overturned. A special meeting of the SAB may be called by the chair upon the filing of such appeal, and the SAB may in its discretion suspend the operation of the order or determination of the city engineer until such time as the SAB has acted upon the appeal. 
(6)  Absence of chair. The vice-chair or the chair pro tem shall possess all the authority delegated to the chair by this section when action in his/her absence or in his/her stead is required. 
(7)  Review of SAB's decision. Any person aggrieved by any final order of determination of the SAB hereunder shall have judicial review by common law writ of certiorari.

The lien shall attach to each lot or parcel of benefited property at the time the annual improvement assessment is made, and then shall take precedence over all other liens, whether created prior to or subsequent to the making of such improvement assessment, except state, county and municipal property taxes, and prior special assessments. The lien shall not be defeated or postponed by any private or judicial sale, by any mortgage, or by any error or mistake in the description of the property or in the names of the owners, if the description is sufficient to identify the property subject to the improvement assessment.

The establishing ordinance shall also direct that full details, drawings, plans, specifications, and surveys for the proposed improvement and estimates of costs for the improvement be prepared by the city engineer, or other engineer or engineering firm contracted for such work by the city; or the board may adopt plans for such improvements already prepared. 
(2)  The board shall also have the power to design, or cause to be designed, contract for, execute, or cause to be executed, improvements or alterations for flood control, water management, soil erosion, and disaster relief and to cause not less than two-thirds of the cost or expense of the improvements mentioned in this subsection (2) not paid by federal funds to be assessed against property within the floodplain in which the improvements or alterations are made. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any local charter provision or other law to the contrary, the board may approve the transfer to the city of a public facility that is acquired, improved or constructed by a third party, including a private entity, if the city reasonably anticipates that private investment of not less than $25,000,000.00 will be made on property adjacent to the public facility. 
(A)  (i)  The transfer of any public facility shall be documented by written agreement between the city and the transferor or transferors of the public facility and the agreement shall be approved in substantially final form by the board. As a condition to entering into an agreement, the board shall determine that the city and the citizens of the city will receive a public benefit from entering into such agreement. Before approving any agreement setting forth the terms of the transfer of a public facility pursuant to this chapter and the improvement assessment of any portion of consideration thereof pursuant to section 24-304, the board shall hold a public hearing relating to the proposed agreement and improvement assessment. 
(ii)  Notice of the public hearing shall be published by the city in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least two weeks prior to the date of such public hearing.

(C)  Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, sections 24-303-24-306 shall not apply to the acquisition of any public facilities pursuant to this subsection 24-302(3) or improvement assessments relating to the acquisition. 
(D)  The authority granted to the city by this subsection 24-302(3) shall not be construed to limit in any manner the authority of the city to acquire a public facility or any other property in accordance with other law or any local charter. 
(E)  Any action taken by the board relating to the transfer or a public facility and the appointment and assessment of the consideration therefor shall be by an ordinance and shall take effect upon adoption on second and final reading. Except as specifically provided in this subsection 24-302(3), the ordinance need not be published or posted, or be subject to veto by the city's mayor, nor shall the ordinance require for its passage more than a majority vote of all members of the board then in office.

    This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by the Tennessee Code Annotated, title 7, and chapter 84, parts 1-5. 
(Ord. No. 2011-12, § I, 9-11-2012) 
Sec. 24-402. - Declaration of necessity. 
    The Tennessee General Assembly has determined and declared that the deterioration of the central business districts of some cities of the state by reason of dilapidation, obsolescence, overcrowding, faulty arrangement or design, deleterious land use, obsolete layout, or any combination of these or other factors, is a threat to the property tax and other revenue sources of such cities and is detrimental to the safety, health, morals, and general and economic welfare of the cities in which they are located; that the elimination of urban blight and decay and the modernization and general improvement of such central business districts by governmental action is considered necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare of such cities; and that restoration of such central business districts is an appropriate subject for remedial legislation. Further, cities should be encouraged to create self-financing central business improvement districts and designate district management corporations to execute self-help programs to enhance their local business climates; and should be given the broadest possible discretion in establishing self-help programs most consistent with their local needs, goals and objectives.

(Ord. No. 2011-12, § I, 9-11-2012)

    This chapter is intended to afford an alternative method for the making of improvements by the city, the creation of special improvement districts for central business districts of the city, the levy of assessments and the issuance of bonds by the city, and shall not be so construed as to deprive the city of the right to make improvements, create special improvement districts, levy assessments or other special taxes or issue bonds under authority of any other law of the State of Tennessee now in effect or hereafter enacted; nevertheless, this chapter shall constitute full authority for the making of improvements, creation of central business improvement districts, levy of assessments and issuance of bonds under Tennessee Code Annotated title 9, chapter 21, to the extend applicable, by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2011-12, § I, 9-11-2012)

Similar petitions for the organization of the same district may be filed, and together shall be regarded as one petition with the original. All such petitions filed prior to the hearing on the first petition filed shall be considered by the city in the same manner as if filed with the first petition placed on file. The initiating petition shall set forth: 
(A)  The name of the proposed district, which shall include the name of the city together with the words, "central business improvement district;" and 
(B)  A general description of the boundaries of the district or the territory to be included in the district, identified with sufficient certainty to enable any and all owners to determine whether their property lies within the district; and 
(C)  A general description of the improvements, services, projects proposed for the district, and other uses of special assessment revenues within the district; and 
(D)  The total estimated costs of the proposed improvements, services, projects and other proposed uses and the estimated rate of levy of the special assessment, with a proposed breakdown by property classification if such classification is to be used; and 
(E)  A statement that the petition is filed pursuant to the terms of this chapter; and 
(F)  A request that a district be established pursuant to this chapter and that the administration of the district be governed by;

The jurisdiction of the city to make and provide, finance and levy assessment for the cost of any improvements and services within a district shall not be impaired by a lack of commonness, unity, or singleness of the location, purpose or character of the improvements of services, of by the fact that any one or more of the properties included in the district are subsequently determined not to be benefited by such improvement or improvements, or by a particular portion of the improvement or improvements, and is not assessed for such improvement, or improvements.

(2)  The filing of protests by owners representing more than one-half of the assessed value of the property to be included in the district shall not bar the board from amending the district boundaries in such manner as to reduce the number of objectors to one-half or less of the assessed value of the district; provided, that a new public hearing shall be held on the amended district pursuant to the same provisions and procedures established in this chapter for the initial public hearing.

Sec. 25-401. - Purpose. 
    It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to establish the regulatory procedure for assessing and collecting parkland impact fees and/or parkland dedication for new development within the City of Franklin to assure the provision of adequate parks to serve such new development, by requiring the developer to pay their pro rata share of the costs of new parks or expansions reasonably attributable to such new development. 
( Ord. No. 2016-25 , § I, 5-22-2018) 
Sec. 25-402. - Authority. 
    This chapter is adopted pursuant to the powers conferred by the Franklin Municipal Charter, art. H, § 1(38), as amended by Priv. Acts 1987, ch. 54 and by Priv. Acts 1987, ch. 117 (HB 1311). 
( Ord. No. 2016-25 , § I, 5-22-2018) 
Sec. 25-403. - Definitions. 
(1)  BOMA means the City of Franklin Board of Mayor and Aldermen. 
(2)  Community park means a park that is larger in size and serves a broader purpose than neighborhood parks. Their focus is on meeting the recreational needs of several neighborhoods or large sections of the community, as well as preserving unique landscapes and open spaces. They allow for group activities and offer other recreational opportunities not feasible, nor desirable, at the neighborhood level. As with neighborhood parks, they should be developed for both active and passive recreation activities. The optimal size for a community park should exceed 25 acres. Design features might include large play structures, informal fields for youth play, tennis courts, volleyball courts, horseshoe areas, swimming pools, disc golf, trails, group picnic areas, open space and unique landscapes/features, nature study areas, ornamental gardens, and facilities for cultural activities such as plays and concerts in the park. 
(3)  Comprehensive parks and recreation master plan means the adopted long-range master plan for park and recreational facilities for the City of Franklin. The plan establishes the city's vision and framework to guide park related facilities and amenities decisions, and includes planning policies and recommendations for the future development of the municipal park and recreation system for the City of Franklin. 
(4)  Developer means any individual, firm, co-partnership, joint venture, association, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, syndicate, or other group, combination or entity responsible for a new development or a new development project. 
(5)  Development means new construction, building, reconstruction, erection, extension, betterment or improvement of land providing a building or structure or the addition to any building or structure, or any part thereof, which provides, adds to or increases the floor area of a residential or nonresidential use. 
(6)  Departmental review team or DRT means the group of department heads, or their designees, from the city departments responsible for the review of all development applications. 
(7)  Dwelling unit or dwelling units means a room, or rooms connected, which constitute a separate, independent housekeeping establishment for owner occupancy, rental or lease on a daily, weekly, monthly, or longer basis; physically separated from any other room(s) or dwelling units which may be in the same structure; and containing independent cooking and sleeping facilities. 
(8)  Floodplain means the relatively flat or lowland area adjoining a river, stream, watercourse, lake, or other body of standing water, which has been or may be covered temporarily by floodwater. For purposes of this chapter, the floodplain is defined as the 100-year floodplain having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and/or any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. 
(9)  Greenway (off-road) means a linear undeveloped area linking various types of development by such facilities as multi-use trails, bicycle paths, footpaths, and bridle paths. Greenways are usually kept in their natural state except for the pathway and areas immediately adjacent to the pathway. 
(10)  Neighborhood park means a park that is a basic unit of the park system and serves as the recreational and social focus of a neighborhood, with both passive and active activities. They are not intended to be used for programmed activities that result in overuse, noise, parking problems, and congestion. They should be geared for those living within the service area. A neighborhood park accommodates a variety of ages, including children, adults, and seniors. Neighborhood parks are usually not smaller than five acres in size and are developed centrally within the neighborhood to encompass a service radius of one-half mile. Neighborhood parks primarily facilitate recreational activities, including play structures, sitting areas, and open space. Ideally, these neighborhood parks are linked to the neighborhood and to each other by a pathway or walk system and respond to the need for basic recreational amenities close to home. 
(11)  HOA means homeowner association which is an incorporated nonprofit organization operating under recorded agreements through which each owner in the development is automatically a member, and each lot is subject to a proportionate share of the expenses of the organization's activities or responsibilities. 
(12)  Park quadrant and/or quadrant means a geographic district of the City of Franklin established by the comprehensive parks and recreation master plan that establishes service areas for parks and the basis for how parkland impact fees or parkland dedication requirements are calculated/determined. The plan divides the city into four quadrants. 
(13)  Parkland dedication means the option where a developer may dedicate land to be used by the city for parkland in lieu of paying parkland impact fees. 
(14)  Parkland impact fee means fees levied and collected by the City of Franklin against new land development to provide that new development contribute its fair share of the cost of providing parkland improvements and services pursuant to the powers conferred by the Franklin Municipal Charter, art. H, § 1(38), as amended by Priv. Acts 1987, ch. 54 and by Priv. Acts 1987, ch. 117 (HB 1311).

1.1.11	Review of Public Improvements
Whenever the Franklin Municipal Planning Commission (FMPC) has adopted a plan of the municipality (for example, Connect  Franklin or the Master Parks Plan) or any part thereof, then and thenceforth no street, park or other public way, ground, place or space, no public building or structure, or no public utility, whether publicly or privately owned, shall be constructed or authorized in the City until and unless the location and extent thereof shall have been submitted to and approved by the FMPC.  In case of disapproval, the FMPC shall
 

 
communicate its reasons to the BOMA, which by a vote of a majority of its membership, shall have the power to overrule such disapproval and, upon such overruling, the BOMA shall have the power to proceed. If the public way, ground, place, space, building, structure or utility is one the authorization or financing of which does not, under the law governing the same, fall within the province of the BOMA, then the submission to the FMPC shall be by the State, County, District, City, or other Board or official having such jurisdiction, and the FMPCs disapproval may be overruled by the chief legislative body by a majority vote of its membership, or by such official. The widening, narrowing, relocation, vacation, change in the use, acceptance, acquisition, sale or lease of any street or public way, ground, place, property or structure shall be subject to similar submission and approval, and the failure to approve may be similarly overruled. The failure of the FMPC to act within 30 days from and after the date of official submission to it shall be deemed approval, unless a longer period is granted by the BOMA or other submitting board or official. The date of official submission shall be the date at which the FMPC first considers the item.

Any violation of previous versions of this Ordinance shall continue to be a violation under this Ordinance and shall be subject to the penalties and enforcement set forth in Chapter 22: Enforcement,  unless the  applicable use, development, improvement, construction, or activity complies with  the provisions  of this Ordinance. Payment shall be  required  for any civil penalty assessed under the previous regulations, even if the original violation is no longer considered to be a violation under this Ordinance.
 
1.1.13	Nonconformities
Any use, building, structure, development, improvement, or lot that legally existed on the effective date of this Ordinance that does not meet all provisions set forth in this Ordinance shall be considered nonconforming and shall be controlled by Chapter 2, Nonconformities.

1.1.14	Severability
It is expressly declared that this Ordinance and each Chapter, Section, Subsection, sentence, phrase, and all other content, is adopted and enforceable regardless of  whether  one or more other portions of this Ordinance are judged invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction. Such judgment shall not affect:

2.1	General Provisions

2.1.1	Applicability
Any principal or accessory use, structure, lot of record, sign, or tower that was lawfully established before the effective date of this Ordinance and no longer complies with this Ordinance is considered nonconforming. Nonconformities shall be allowed to continue pursuant to this Chapter.

2.1.2	Determination of
Nonconformity Status
The burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be on the owner of the property on which the purported nonconformity is located.


2.2	Nonconforming Uses

2.2.1	Change of Use
A.	A nonconforming use shall not be changed
to or replaced with another use unless that use conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance.
B.	A change in occupancy or ownership shall
not, by itself, constitute a change of use.

2.2.2	Discontinuance or Abandonment of a Nonconforming Use
A.	When a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of 30 months, as specified by T.C.A. § 13-7-208, the use shall not thereafter be re-established or resumed.

B.	Operation  only  of  an   accessory   use to the principal  nonconforming  use during the 30-month period shall not constitute continuation of the principal nonconforming use.

2.2.3	Expansion of a Nonconforming Use
Nonconforming uses may be expanded,
provided the following is met:
A.	The nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, expanded, or altered in a way that increases the degree of nonconformity. Any proposed expansion must  conform to all other applicable standards of this Ordinance.  For example:

2.	A duplex use in a single-family residential district is not  permitted to add any additional dwelling units, inclusive of accessory dwellings.
B.	The type, size, and intensity of the proposed expansion, including  such considerations as the size of the site, the location of the nonconforming use upon it, the hours of operation, the amount of noise generated, and the number of people who are likely to patronize the use will be adequate with respect to minimizing any negative impacts on adjoining lots and avoiding nuisances to adjacent landowners; and
C.	The nonconforming use shall not be expanded through the acquisition of additional land beyond that in use by the nonconformity on the effective date of this Ordinance.

B.	In accordance with T.C.A. § 13-7-603, short- term vacation rentals that were legally established and issued a permit prior to the effective date of this Ordinance are subject to the law in place at the time that the property was being used as a short- term vacation rental, until the property is:

2.3	Nonconforming Structures

2.3.1	Applicability
This Section shall apply to nonconforming structures, other than signs and towers. See Subsection 15.1.11, Nonconforming Signs, or Clause 5.1.4.T.15, Nonconforming Towers, as applicable.

A nonconforming structure may be expanded,
provided the following is met:
A.	The nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged, expanded, or altered in a way that increases the degree of nonconformity. Any proposed expansion must  conform to all other applicable standards of this Ordinance.  For example:
1.	For a building that is located five feet from a side lot line, where this Ordinance requires a ten foot minimum side yard setback, any building addition or increase in building height must comply with the ten-foot setback; and
2.	For a  building  that  is  entirely  within a required front yard setback, any building addition must occur only to the rear of the building.
B.	The type, size, and intensity of the proposed expansion, such as the size of the site and the location of the nonconforming structure upon it, will be adequate with respect to minimizing any negative impacts on adjoining lots and avoiding nuisances to
 
 	Nonconforming Lots	02

 
adjacent landowners; and
C.	The nonconforming structure shall  not be expanded through the acquisition of additional land beyond that in use by the nonconformity on the effective date of this Ordinance.

2.3.4	Reconstruction of a New
Structure
A.	An existing structure for a nonconforming
use, other than multifamily residential, may be torn down and a new structure of the same building type or of a building type permitted in the applicable zoning district may be reconstructed, provided the following is met:
1.	There is a reasonable amount  of space on the property so as to avoid nuisances to adjacent landowners. Any reconstruction or redevelopment must conform to all other applicable standards of this Ordinance; and
2.	The type, size, and intensity of the proposed  reconstruction,  such   as the size of the site  and  the  location of the nonconformity upon it, will be adequate with respect to minimizing any negative impacts on adjoining lots.
B.	New structures for a nonconforming multifamily residential use may be reconstructed only in the event of damage, whether partial or complete, by involuntary fire or wind damage or other natural disaster, pursuant to T.C.A. § 13-7-208.

To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new towers, provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the following:
1)	A tower that is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of additional antennas shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower, unless the Department of Building and Neighborhood Services permits reconstruction as a monopole, or otherwise determines that a different tower type would enhance collocation possibilities;
2)	An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed 30 feet over the towers original height,    to     accommodate the collocation of additional antennae. The towers pre- modification height shall be used    to    calculate    distance
 

 
separation requirements; and
3)	A tower that is being rebuilt to accommodate the collocation of an  additional antenna may be moved within 50 feet of its existing location, or elsewhere on the site, as determined by the Department of Building and Neighborhood Services. After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only one tower may remain on the site. The relocation of a tower shall in no way  be  deemed to cause a violation of this Subsection.
10.   Administrative Appeal

Tower or antenna height;
d.	Surrounding topography;
e. Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
f.	Proposed ingress and egress; and
g.	Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technologies that do not require a tower or structure. No new tower shall be permitted unless	the applicant submits evidence that meets one of the following criteria that no existing tower, structure, or alternative technology can accommodate the applicants proposed antenna:
i.	No existing towers or structures are located  within the geographic area that meets the applicants engineering conditions consistent with these requirements;
ii.	Existing towers or structures are of insufficient height to meet the applicants engineering requirements, or they have insufficient structural strength to support the applicants proposed antenna and related equipment;
iii.	The applicants proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicants proposed antenna;
iv.	The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure, or to adapt
 

 
an existing tower or structure for sharing exceed the cost of new tower development;
v.	The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable; or
vi.	The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that  does  not   require   the use of towers or structures is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology un-suitable.
13.	Maintenance
To ensure the structural integrity of towers and antennas, owners shall ensure that they are maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building codes and the applicable standards published by the Electronic Industries Association.
If, upon inspection, the tower or antenna fails to comply with such codes and  standards  and  constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being given, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower or antenna into compliance. Failure to do so shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owners expense.
14.	Removal  of  Abandoned  Towers  and Antennas
Any tower or antenna that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months or more shall be considered to have been abandoned, and the owner
 
shall remove the same within 90 days of receipt of notice of abandonment from the Department  of  Building and Neighborhood  Services.  Failure to remove an abandoned tower or antenna  within  said  90  days   shall be grounds to remove the tower or antenna at the owners expense.
If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users abandon the tower. A performance agreement shall be established with appropriate financial security to defray the costs of removal.
15.	Nonconforming Towers

7.1	General Provisions

7.1.1	Frontage Description
A.	The frontage is the area between (a) the
facade line of a principal building, extended to the side lot line or building site line, (or if there is no building, the front setback line) and (b) the curb (or if there is no curb, the edge) of the vehicular lanes of a public or private street or an internal drive, a pedestrian walkway, or an open space. Corner or through lots or building sites have two frontages.
B.	Frontage types specify the treatment of the frontage. The frontage type must be one of those permitted in the applicable zoning district per Section 7.2, Overview of Frontage Types.


Figure 7.1.1.A Frontage Example


 


7.1.2	Lot and Building Site Frontage
A.	Every  lot  or  building  site  shall  have  a
frontage on a public street, private street, or internal drive, in that priority order, except that:
1.	Residential lots shall front only a public street; however, up to five percent of the lots in a residential development of more than 100 residential lots may
 
front a courtyard, pursuant to Section
11.7, Courtyard.
2.	An internal drive may be an alternative to  a  public  or  private  street  above only when the development contains two	or	more	principal	buildings in a nonresidential, mixed-use, or multifamily  development,  subject  to DRT approval.
B.	A lot with proposed development of two or more principal buildings shall provide building sites that designate the frontage type and location on a public street, private street, or internal drive, as applicable.
C.	New lots on the perimeter of a proposed development, where adjacent to an existing street, shall be oriented so that the front facades of buildings face the existing street.

7.1.3	Exceptions
The following exceptions are permitted to Subsection 7.1.2, Lots and Building Site Frontage:
A.	A residential lot may have a side lot line that fronts an existing collector street or higher classification when the lot:
1.	Fronts a local street by the entrance to the subdivision; or
2.	Is designed around a close.
B.	New lots may be oriented so that the rear facades of buildings face I-65 or Mack Hatcher Parkway when outside of the SCO. See Subsection 12.7.3, Buffers along I-65 and Mack Hatcher Parkway, for additional requirements.

D.	Other techniques that break up the scale of a building to complement existing development patterns, subject to approval by the applicable review body.



8.4	Transitional Features for Nonresidential, Multifamily, and Mixed-Use Development in the CFO

8.4.1	Applicability
A.	This Section shall apply to nonresidential,
multifamily, and mixed-use development in the CFO to achieve design compatibility between new and existing development, where the existing development is established and expected to remain, pursuant to Envision Franklin.
B.	The standards in this Chapter may be used, all or in part, to achieve a transition between land uses, subdivisions, sites, lots, or structures, subject to the approval of	the applicable review body, with consideration given to Envision Franklin and the Historic District Design Guidelines, where applicable.

8.4.2	Conflicting Provisions
A.	In cases where the standards of this Section
and other Chapters conflict, the more restrictive standard shall apply.
B.	In cases where the standards of this Section and Section 8.1, Transition Areas Abutting Residential Lots, conflict, then this Section shall apply.
C.	Within the HPO district, where Historic District Design Guidelines and this Chapter conflict,    the    Historic    District    Design
 
Guidelines shall take precedence.

8.4.3	Building Setbacks
Outside of the R4, R6, MR, OR, CC, DD, 1ST, and 5TH districts, the minimum front yard setback shall be the average setback of existing buildings on the same block face. No new building shall be located closer to the front lot line than the closest adjacent building.

8.4.4	Building Height
A.	Facade   width   and   height   on   facades
of adjacent buildings and buildings on opposing sides of a street shall be consistent with each other such that neither facade exceeds the others dimensions by more than 25 percent. Topography, viewshed analysis, and methods outlined in Paragraph 8.4.4.D may be included in this assessment.
B.	At the edge of an underlying zoning district where the adjacent district has a lower maximum building height, buildings shall transition in height using methods outlined in Paragraph 8.4.4.D.
C.	Proposed multifamily buildings located within 100 feet of houses or duplexes shall not exceed two stories.

A.	The    placement    of    utilities    shall    be
determined pursuant to the General Requirements and Technical Specifications Water Management Department.
B.	Utilities shall be placed to allow for future infill of new buildings on development sites that have infill potential, as determined by the DRT.
C.	Water, sewer, and reclaimed water mains shall	be extended to property lines designated by the Water Management Department as deemed necessary for future system expansion.

16.1.3	Underground Requirements
To provide safe, reliable delivery of utility services and avoid the visual clutter of overhead utility lines, the following shall apply:
A.	All new telephone, gas,  sewer,  water, fiber optic, and cable lines shall be placed underground; and
B.	All new electrical distributionlinesthat serve development shall be placed underground, with the following exceptions:
1.	The Department of Building and Neighborhood	Services  may  grant an exception when the replacement, relocation, or upgrade of an existing overhead service with underground service would result in the introduction of additional poles, guywires, and ancillary equipment into an existing built environment; and
 
2.	The FMPC may recommend  and  the BOMA may grant an exception for placing distribution lines underground within an existing public right-of-way when the BOMA determines there are special circumstances that warrant overhead distribution lines. As an alternative, the BOMA may consider the	execution of a development agreement that allows for  the recapture of up-front costs of placing utilities underground.
C.	TVA transmission lines and MTEMC feeder lines for system needs and not needed for a specific development may be situated on poles aboveground.
D.	Pad-mounted transformers, switch cabinets, sector boxes, communication support boxes, terminal boxes, meter cabinets, and concealed ducts may be situated aboveground if they are used solely	to provide service within the development and are used solely with underground distribution lines.

17.6	Floodplain Protection

17.6.1	Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Objectives

A.	Statutory Authorization
The Legislature of the State of Tennessee has in T.C.A. § 13-7-201 through § 13-7- 210, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the BOMA ordains as follows:

B.	Findings of Fact
1.	The City wishes to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and in order to do so must meet the NFIP regulations found in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 1, Section 60.3.
2.	Areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation, which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public	expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
3.	Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood hazard  areas  which  are   vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
 
C.	Statement of Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This Section is designed to:
1.	Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
2.	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including	community facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3.	Control the alteration of natural floodplains,	stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
4.	Control  filling,  grading,  dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and
5.	Prevent or regulate the  construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
D.	Objectives
The objectives of this Section are:
1.	To protect human life, health, safety and property;
2.	To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
3.	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding, which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4.	To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5.	To minimize damage to public facilities and  utilities  such  as  water  and  gas
 

 
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood prone areas;
6.	To help maintain a stable  tax  base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas to minimize blight in flood areas;
7.	To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood prone area; and
8.	To maintain eligibility for participation in the NFIP.

17.6.2	General Provisions
A.	Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard
1.	The areas of special flood hazard in the City are identified by FEMA in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated December 22, 2016, and on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), Community 470206, as follows:

e. In all approximate A Zones, all new subdivision and other development proposals (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include within such proposals base flood elevation data in accordance with this Section.
C.	Standards for Special Flood Hazard Areas with Established Base Flood Elevations and with Floodways Designated
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Subsection 17.6.2, General Provisions, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris, or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1.	Encroachments are prohibited, including		earthen  fill   material, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within	the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted; however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
 

 
standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or new development shall not result in any increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A Tennessee registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data, using the same methodologies as in the effective Flood Insurance Study for the City and certification, thereof; and
2.	New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Subsection 17.6.4, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.
D.	Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard Zones AE with Established Base Flood Elevations but Without Floodways Designated
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Subsection 17.6.2, General Provisions, where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions shall apply:
1.	No encroachments, including fill material, new construction and substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated    development,    will    not
 
increase the water surface  elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles; and
2.	New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Subsection 17.6.4, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.
E.	Standards for Streams Without Established Base Flood Elevations and Floodways (A Zones)
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Subsection 17.6.2, General Provisions, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided and where  a floodway  has not  been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
1.	The floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available  from  any  Federal, State, or other sources,  including data developed as a result of these regulations (see 2, below), as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in approximate A Zones meet the requirements of Subsection 17.6.4, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction;
2.	All new subdivision proposals and other	proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever
 

 
is the lesser, shall include within such proposals base flood elevation data;
3.	Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations have not been established and where such data is not available from other sources, require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. All applicable data including elevations or floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in Paragraph 17.6.3.B, Permit Procedures. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Subsection 17.6.4, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction;
4.	Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations have not been established and where such data is not available from other sources, no encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles; and
5.	New construction and substantial improvements    of    buildings,   where
 
permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Subsection 17.6.4, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction. Within approximate A Zones, those subsections of Subsection 17.6.4, dealing with the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, shall assure watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and manufactured home provisions are complied with as required.
F.	Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones)
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Subsection 17.6.2, General Provisions, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition to those set forth in Subsection 17.6.4, shall apply:
1.	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least  one  foot  above as many feet as the depth number specified on the FIRM, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards
 

 
of  Subsection  17.6.4,  Provisions  for Flood Hazard Reduction;
2.	All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at least one foot above the  flood  depth  number  specified on the FIRM, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and	with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is specified on the FIRM, the structure  shall  be  floodproofed   to at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this Section and shall provide such  certification to the  floodplain  administrator  as set forth above and as required in accordance with Paragraph 17.6.3.B, Permit Procedures; and
3.	Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
G.	Standards for Areas Protected by Flood
Protection System (A-99 Zones)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Subsection 17.6.2, General Provisions, are areas of the 100- year   floodplain   protected   by   a   flood
 
protection system but where base flood elevations have not been determined. Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of Subsections 17.6.3 and 17.6.4, shall apply.

H.	Standards for Unmapped Streams
Located within the City are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams, the following provisions shall apply:
1.	No encroachments including fill material or other development including structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the locality.
2.	When a new flood hazard risk zone, and base flood elevation and floodway data is available, new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the standards established in accordance with Subsections 17.6.3, Administration, and 17.6.4, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.

17.6.5	Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals

A.	Variance Procedures
In the case of a request for a variance to a provision within this Section, the following shall apply:
 

 
1.	The Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of Section 17.6, Floodplain Protection, as specified in this Subsection;
2.	Variances for may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this Section to preserve the historic character and design of the structure;
3.	In passing upon variance applications, the BZA shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, this Section, and:
a.	The danger that materials may be swept onto other property to the injury of others;
b.	The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion;
c.	The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage;
d.	The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e. The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent use;
f.	The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
g.	The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
h.	The safety of access to the property
 
in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
i.	The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the  flood  waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
j. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, and streets and bridges.
4.	Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this Section, the BZA may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section.
5.	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any  increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
B.	Conditions for Variances
1.	Variances shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary, considering the flood hazard and the factors listed in Paragraph 17.6.5.A.
2.	Variances shall only be issued upon:
a.	A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; or
c.	A determination that  the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary     public     expense,
 

create nuisance, cause fraud  on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or Ordinances.
3.	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance (as high as $25 for $100) coverage, and that such construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.
4. The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request.

18.1	General Provisions

18.1.1	Applicability
This Chapter shall apply to development or redevelopment on, adjacent to, or across the street from lands or sites:
A.	Listed on the National Register of Historic
Places; or
B.	Eligible for designation on the National Register of Historic Places, as determined by the Tennessee Historical Commission.

18.1.2	Review for Compliance
Review of the proposed development or redevelopment to ensure compliance with this Chapter shall occur with the review of development plans, site plans, preliminary plats, final plats that create new lots, or building permits, as applicable.
 
18.1.3	Determination of Historic
Resource Edge Treatment
A.	In  order  to  protect  freestanding  historic
lands and structures from negative visual impacts associated with new development occurring in their proximity, new development  and  redevelopment  shall be subject to one of four types of historic resource edge treatments in this Chapter.
B.	The edge treatments provide a context- based treatment to either screen the new development from the historic resource or integrate it into the new development.
C.	The applicable historic resource edge treatment shall be determined by the Department of Planning and Sustainability based on:
1.	The context, setting, and location of
the historic resource;
2.	The descriptions of the edge treatments as described in this Chapter;
3.	Which edge treatment will most enhance and protect the prominence of the historic resource; and
4.	Envision Franklin.
D.	If the applicant disagrees with the determination, the applicant may appeal the decision to the FMPC following a recommendation by the HZC.
 
18	Overview of Types of Historic Resource Edge Treatments 	

18.2	Overview of Types of Historic Resource Edge Treatments

Historic Resource Edge Treatment                                                                   Illustration
Naturalistic  Screening:   Naturalistic   screening   creates a year-round visual obstruction and significant spatial separation between the historic resource setting  and the new development or redevelopment. The historic resource, its setting, and  surrounding site features are preserved. The naturalistic screening edge treatment provides an opaque screen of evergreen trees mixed with existing vegetation along the common boundaries of the historic resource site and the site of the new development or redevelopment.
Farm-Field Boundary: The farm-field boundary replicates the tree-lined property boundaries historically prevalent throughout the County, which generally evolved as leftover vegetation that grew along the borders of agricultural fields. This is accomplished by providing a historically based fence or wall and deciduous and cedar trees planted linearly along common boundary between the historic resource and the development or redevelopment. The historic resource, its setting, and surrounding site features are preserved. The farm-field boundary provides modest separation between the development or redevelopment and the historic resource. Because buildings within the development or redevelopment remain in view of the historic resource, they are designed to be similar in scale
 and architectural character with the historic building. 	

Estate Enclosure: This treatment preserves the historic resource, surrounding site features, and the setting while providing an estate enclosure at the edge. The estate enclosure provides moderate spatial separation between the development or redevelopment and the historic resource, and consists of formal plantings.

Integrated  Edge:  The  integrated  edge  incorporates the historic resource into the overall design of the development or redevelopment, with the historic building being a prominent focal point, appearing as if the balance of the site evolved around it.

18.3	Naturalistic Screening
 

18.3.1	Description
A.	Naturalistic screening creates a year-round
visual obstruction and significant spatial separation between the historic resource setting and the new development or redevelopment. The historic resource, its setting, and surrounding site features are preserved.
B.	The naturalistic screening edge treatment provides an opaque screen of evergreen trees mixed with existing vegetation along the common boundaries of the historic resource site and the site of the new development or redevelopment.
C.	This approach is typically appropriate for a site that already has an abundance of mature vegetation, as opposed to open farm fields.

18.3.2	Location
A.	In  cases  where  the  developing  property
is adjacent to the property containing the historic resource, the naturalistic screening shall be located along the periphery of the developing property, unless an alternate location provides a superior amount of buffering.
B.	In cases where new development is proposed  on  the  same  property  as  the
 
historic resource, the naturalistic screening shall be located as far from the historic resource as is practicable given the context of the site and any topographic or environmental considerations.

18.3.3	Standards
A.	Site	features	that	emphasize	the
prominence of a historic resource shall be preserved within the spatial setting of the historic resource. Such features include topography, mature vegetation, streams, and historic walls and fences.
B.	Naturalistic screening shall have a minimum width of 75 feet. Development on lots containing or adjacent to a National Historic Landmark shall have a minimum width of 100 feet. This area shall be placed in a conservation easement.
C.	Planting materials shall:
1.	Be predominately evergreen trees;
2.	Be staggered in an informal manner, which, upon maturity, creates an opaque screen;
3.	Be of a sufficient height upon maturity that new development is visually screened, regardless of building heights or topography; and
4.	Include at least two or more different indigenous tree species.
D.	Trees shall be required at a rate of one tree per every  400  square  feet.  Credit for existing vegetation may reduce the planting requirements, so long as the existing materials and new planting materials achieve an opaque screen.
E.	Pruning of trees or shrubs near ground level shall be prohibited.
F.	Berms, fences, or walls shall not be used.

18.3.4	Grading
The   natural,   existing   topography   shall   be preserved.  Grading is prohibited.

18.4	Farm-Field Boundary
 

18.4.1	Description
A.	The  farm-field  boundary  replicates  the
tree-lined property boundaries historically prevalent throughout the County, which generally evolved as leftover vegetation that grew along the borders of agricultural fields.  This is accomplished by providing a historically based fence or wall and deciduous and cedar trees planted linearly along common boundary between the historic resource and the development or redevelopment.
B.	The historic resource, its setting, and surrounding site features are preserved. The farm-field boundary provides modest separation between the development or redevelopment and the historic resource.
C.	Because buildings within the development or redevelopment remain in view of the historic resource, they are designed to be similar in scale and architectural character with the historic building.
 
18.4.2	Location
A.	In  cases  where  the  developing  property
is adjacent to the property containing the historic resource, the farm-field boundary shall be located along the periphery of the developing property, unless an alternate location provides a superior amount of buffering.
B.	In cases where new development is proposed on the same property as the historic resource, the farm-field boundary shall be located as far from the historic resource as is practicable given the context of the site and any topographic or environmental considerations.

18.4.3	Standards
A.	Site	features	that	emphasize	the
prominence of a historic resource shall be preserved within the spatial setting of the historic resource. Such features include topography, mature vegetation, streams, and historic walls and fences.
B.	Farm-field boundaries shall have a minimum width of 30 feet. Development on lots containing or adjacent to a National Historic Landmark shall provide a minimum width of 50 feet.
C.	Farm-field boundaries shall be linear in form and shall include a historically-based fence or wall along the length of the boundary. Acceptable types include rail fences, four-board horse fences, or dry- stacked stone walls consistent in design and stone type with historic antecedents found in the County.
D.	Planting materials shall:
1.	Be spaced in an informal, irregular manner along the fence or wall; and
2.	Be dominated by deciduous trees, although native evergreens, such as cedars, may be included for diversity

and visual screening purposes; and
E.	Trees shall be required at a rate of one canopy tree per every 400 square feet. Credit for existing vegetation may reduce the planting requirements when located in a suitable location.
F.	New buildings within view of the historic resource shall be designed to be similar in scale and architectural character with the historic building.

developing property, unless an alternate
 
18.5	Estate Enclosure
 

18.5.1	Description
A.	The  historic  resource,  surrounding  site
features, and the setting are preserved while an estate enclosure demarcates the periphery. The estate enclosure consists of formal plantings and is more appropriate for historic buildings having classical architectural styling, such as Federal, Greek Revival, Italianate, Gothic Revival, or Classic Revival, as opposed to less formal vernacular styles, such as simple frame farm houses.
B.	The estate enclosure lends itself to situations in which the historic resource setting, and perhaps the overall development site, is somewhat limited in land area.
C.	The estate enclosure is not intended to be an opaque screen between the new development and the historic resource; therefore, new buildings within view of the historic resource are designed to be similar in scale and architectural character with the historic building.

18.5.2	Location
A.	In  cases  where  the  developing  property
is adjacent to the property containing the historic resource, the estate enclosure shall be located along the periphery of the
 
location provides a superior amount of buffering.
B.	In cases where new development is proposed on the same property as the historic resource, the estate enclosure shall be located as far from the historic resource as is practicable given the context of the site and any topographic or environmental considerations.

18.5.3	Standards
A.	Site	features	that	emphasize	the
prominence of a historic resource shall be preserved within the spatial setting of the historic resource. Such features include topography, mature vegetation, streams, and historic walls and fences.
B.	The estate enclosure shall have a minimum width of 50 feet. Development on lots containing or adjacent to a National Historic Landmark shall provide a minimum width of 75 feet.
C.	Estate enclosures shall:
1.	Consist of trees planted formally in rows with regular spacing, such as an orchard;
2.	Be dominated by deciduous trees; and
3.	Have either:

18.6.1	Description
A.	The   integrated   edge   incorporates   the
historic resource into the overall design of the development or redevelopment, with the historic building being a prominent focal point, appearing as if the balance of the site evolved around it.
B.	New buildings within view of the historic resource are designed to be similar in scale and architectural character with the historic building.

18.6.2	Prominence of the Historic Building
A historic building shall be made a visually prominent focal point of the new development through one or more of the following integration techniques:
A.	Create a square or green fronting the historic building that is designed to highlight the historic resource as a focal point;
B.	Design the street network so that the historic building is at an entry or destination location within the new development; or
C.	Create a corner location for the historic building so that it terminates a public vista
 


as viewed down two or more streets. In such case, adjacent new principal buildings shall be no closer 200 feet from the historic building.

18.6.3	Design of Streets and Driveways
A.	New streets and driveways shall be located and designed to appear as if they were developed over time around the original historic building as part of a natural evolution.
B.	Streets shall reflect the character of the historic building, such as ribbon curb in rural or farm areas.

A.	Rather than attempting to mirror the scale of the historic building, new buildings shall be subordinate in their perceived scale to the historic building;
B.	The roof pitch of new buildings shall be similar to the historic building;
C.	The  roof  forms,  materials,   and   colors of new buildings shall be similar to the nearby historic building (for example, an asphalt shingle roof on a new building that emulates slate in color and approximate thickness would be similar with a slate- roofed historic building);
D.	The shape,  proportion,  rhythm,  and spacing of openings of new buildings shall be similar to that of the historic building;
E.	Nearby buildings shall have key architectural components of the historic building, such as porches, dormers, and arches; and
F.	The materials of the historic building shall be respected by their use to some degree on nearby new buildings.

18.6.6	Development Across the Street From a Historic Building
Where  development  is  proposed  across  a street  from  and  within  view  of  a  historic
 
building,  the  following  shall  apply  to  the
proposed development:
A.	Buildings shall be designed to be similar in scale and architectural character with the historic building; and
B.	Where the historic  resource  property  is at least two acres, any new lot fronting an arterial or collector street across from the historic resource property shall be at least two acres, to lessen the potential adverse impact and intensity of the new development.

20.12.11	Expiration of a Site Plan
A.	In accordance with T.C.A. § 13-4-310, site
plans will expire after three years of their approval date or upon the expiration of its vesting, whichever occurs first. The approval date of a site plan is the date upon which the item is approved, or approved with conditions, on an administrative or FMPC agenda.

2.	Begins site preparation work, which includes any of the following activities: excavating, grading, demolition, removing excess debris to allow for proper grading, or providing a surface for a proper foundation, drainage, and settling for a development project, and physical improvements, such as water and  sanitary  sewer  lines,   footings, or foundations installed on the  site for which construction permits are required.
C.	If	both	requirements	in	Paragraph
20.12.11.A above are met, a site plan will then expire five years after the original approval date (without a request for an extension), or upon the expiration of its
 

 
vesting, whichever comes first.
D.	If construction commences within five years of the original approval date, the site plan will remain valid for:
1.	Ten years for a single-phase development plan; or
2.	15 years for a multi-phase development plan or until the vesting of any associated development plan or preliminary plat expires.
E.	Construction, for  purposes of  this Subsection, means that any foundations for a building are installed and the building has begun to be erected vertically.
F.	If a site plan is not associated with a development plan or  preliminary  plat and is not complete by the end of  this time period, the applicant/developer can request an extension of the vesting period and extension of the site plan expiration date, see Section 20.19, Vesting.

20.12.12	Changes to an Approved Site Plan
Changes to a site plan are still subject to the expiration date of the original approval of a site plan, pursuant to Subsection 20.12.11, Expiration of a Site Plan. As such, changes to site plans approved after a project has commenced construction will also not restart the clock on expiration timelines.
Revisions to an approved site plan that are denied by the applicable review body may affect the vesting property rights, per Section 20.19, Vesting.
When an applicant requests changes to an approved site plan, the applicable review body may need to reapprove the change depending on the significance of the changes requested and whether the site plan is considered a vested plan in accordance with Section 20.19, Vesting. The  DRT  shall  make  these  determinations
 
based on the following criteria:

A.	Site Plan Revision
Significant changes that would substantially affect the terms of the original approval or result in significant adverse impacts on the surrounding properties or the City at-large shall be considered a site plan revision and require a new site plan application. Such site plan revisions shall be subject to review and approval by the original review body. The criteria for site plan revisions include the following:
1.	The density of the development is to be increased;
2.	The gross square footage of nonresidential buildings is to be increased or the number of stories is to be reduced or increased;
3.	Required landscaping materials are to be deleted;
4.	Required open space is to be deleted;
5.	There is any change in plans for historic structures or sites;
6.	Drainage, streets, or other engineering design changes will materially alter items approved in the site plan; or
7.	There are any major changes that could potentially create an adverse impact on stormwater quality, stormwater quantity, or other Stormwater Management Ordinance requirements.
B.	Site Plan Amendment
Minor changes that do not meet the criteria in Paragraph 20.12.12.A above may be requested through a site plan amendment. Site plan amendments do not require a new application and shall be subject to review and approval by the DRT.
C. Changes to vested site plans may result in the review body denying their vesting, as outlined in Section 20.19, Vesting.

B.	For the remainder of this Section, these approved applications shall be referred to as vested plans.

20.19.2	Vesting Periods
A.	The approval of a plan in accordance with
Subsection 20.19.1, Initiation of Vesting, will initiate a vesting period, during which the development standards adopted by the City and in effect on the date of approval shall remain the applicable standards to the vested plan during its vesting period.
B.	The vesting period applicable to a vested plan shall be a period of three years and begins on the date of approval by the applicable review body, which is either:
1.	The effective date of the BOMA resolution approving the development plan;
2.	The meeting date of the FMPC meeting approving the preliminary plat or site plan (not associated with an approved development plan or preliminary plat); or
3.	The date of the administrative agenda approving the preliminary plat or site plan (not associated with an approved development plan or preliminary plat.
 
C.	To keep a vested plan vested, an applicant must:
1.	Secure the approval of a site plan (only applicable when a development plan or preliminary plat is the vested plan);
2.	Obtain necessary permits to start site preparation; and
3.	Begin site preparation work, which includes any of the following activities: excavating, grading, demolition, removing excess debris to allow for proper grading, or providing a surface for a proper foundation, drainage, and settling for a development project, and physical improvements such as water and  sanitary  sewer  lines,   footings, or foundations installed on the  site for which construction permits are required.
D.	Should the applicant meet the three requirements  of  Paragraph   20.19.2.C, the vesting period shall be extended an additional two years from the date of the expiration of the three-year period. During this additional time granted, the applicant shall commence construction and maintain any necessary permits in order to remain vested. Construction, for purposes of this Section, means that any foundations for a building are installed and the building has begun to be erected vertically.
E.	If construction commences, the vesting period shall be extended for a total of ten years from the date of approval of the vested plan, provided that the applicant maintains any necessary permits during the ten-year period.
F.	If the vested plan is identified with two or more sections/phases, then the vesting period shall be extended for total of 15 years from the date of approval of the vested plan, provided that the applicant

G.	In the case of developments which proceed in two or more sections or phases as described on the vested plan, there shall be a separate vesting period applicable to each section or phase. The development standards which are in effect on the date of approval of the vested plan for the first section or phase shall remain the development standards applicable to all subsequent sections or phases of the development; provided, that the total vesting period for all phases shall not exceed 15 years from the date of approval of the vested plan  for  the  first  section or phase, provided that the applicant maintains any necessary permits during the 15-year period.

20.19.3	Extension of Vested Rights
A.	An applicant may request an extension of
their vesting period, which is subject to review and approval by the original review body; however, if the DRT was the original review body, the FMPC shall serve as the review body for the requested extension.
B.	The extension request shall be made prior to end of the vesting period.
C.	The extension request shall be provided in writing to the Department of Planning and Sustainability. The request shall provide rationale as to why the extension shall be granted, and how the extension of the vesting period is in the best  interest  of the community to allow the development to proceed under the existing plan while extending the vested property right.
D.	The extension request shall specify a new expiration of the vesting period.
E.	If the extension is not granted, the vested rights  will  terminate  at  the  end  of  the
 
original vesting period.

20.19.4	Revision of Vested Plans and
Retention of Vested Rights
A.	Recommendations and final action on a
revision to a vested plan shall be based on consideration of the following criteria:
1.	Whether the proposed revision is consistent with all standards of the Ordinance and other applicable development standards in effect on the original approval date of the vested plan; and
2.	Whether the proposed development meets all the requirements or conditions of any other applicable development   approvals,    such    as a development plan or associated modification of standards.
B.	If a governing review body approves a revision to a vested plan, the vesting right is retained.
C.	A revision to a vested plan may be denied based on the following as it is deemed to affect vesting:
1.	Alters the proposed use;
2.	Increases the overall area of development;
3.	Alters the size of any nonresidential structures included in the development plan;
4.	Increases the density of the development so as to affect traffic, noise or other environmental impacts; or
5.	Increases any local government expenditure necessary to implement or sustain the proposed use.
D.	If a revision to a vested plan is denied based on written finding of any of the items listed in Clause 20.19.4.C.1 through 5 above, the applicant has the following two options:
 

 
1.	Proceed under the prior approved plan with the associated vested rights; or
2.	Allow the vested property rights to terminate and submit a new application under this Chapter.
E.	Notwithstanding this Subsection, a vested property right shall not terminate if the BOMA determines, in writing,  that  it  is in the best interest of the community to allow the development to proceed under the plan without terminating the vested property right.

20.19.5	Violation of Conditions of
Approval
The approval of a vested plan shall be subject to any conditions established at the time of approval. Pursuant to T.C.A. § 13-4-310, if the established conditions of approval for a vested plan are not met, the applicant shall be allowed 90 days to cure the violation of any condition of approval; provided further, that the governing review body responsible for the vested plan approval may grant additional time to  cure the violation, upon a written determination that it is in the best interest of the community. Thereafter, the violation of any such conditions shall cause the vested rights applicable  to the vested plan to terminate. However, the governing review body may allow a property right to remain vested despite the occurrence of the violation when a written determination is made that such continuation is in the best interest of the community.

20.19.6	When Vesting Does Not
Apply
A.	A vested development standard  shall not
preclude local government enforcement of any development standard when:
1.	The City obtains written consent by the owner/applicant;
 
2.	The City determines in writing that compelling evidence exists that the development plan seriously threatens the public health, safety, or welfare of the community and the threat cannot be	mitigated within a reasonable period of time by the applicant using the vested property rights;
3.	The City determines in writing the existence of a natural or man-made hazard on or in the immediate vicinity of the subject property, not identified on the development plan, and which if uncorrected would pose a serious threat to the public  health,  safety, or welfare and the threat cannot be mitigated within a reasonable time period by the applicant using the vested rights; or
4.	A development standard is required by federal or state law, rule, regulation, policy, corrective action, order or other type of governance that is required to be enforced by local governments, such as stormwater or FEMA requirements; or
5.	A local government is undertaking an action initiated or measure instituted in order to comply with a newly enacted federal or state law, rule, regulation, policy, corrective action, order or other type of governance.
B.	A vested property right does not preclude, alter, or impair the authority of a local government to exercise its eminent domain powers provided by law.

Subdivision Regulations    4
 


How to Use the Subdivision Regulations
The Subdivision Regulations set the development standards for the subdivision of land, including requirements for design principles, suitability of the land, streets and alleys, lots, and easements, all of which are found in Chapter 2.


Infrastructure requirements, such as water supply, sanitary sewerage, stormwater management, fire hydrants, right-of-way dedication, street lighting, underground utilities, parkland improvements, and landscape improvements are found in Chapter 3.


The Subdivision Regulations provide the procedures for how to subdivide land within the City, which are found in Chapter 4.


Subdividing land into more than two lots is a two-step process.  The first step is the preliminary plat, which involves proposing a layout for a subdivision that complies with the development standards and infrastructure requirements of the City. The second step is the final plat, which involves finalizing the layout in a format suitable for recording with the Registers Office of Williamson County.


When land is subdivided into two lots, a final plat is the only required step. The final plat is also used to create individual lots not involving subdivision of land, to dedicate public right-of-way, to create easements, and to address minor changes proposed to lots that do not involve the creation of a new lot.


The certificate requirements, which are required on final plats, can be found in Chapter 5.
 

 




1.1	Purpose
 
Chapter 1. General Provisions

1.5 Amendments
 
The Subdivision Regulations are designed to provide for the harmonious development of the City; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic; and to secure adequate provision for light, air, recreation, transportation, water, drainage, sewerage and other facilities. The following standards set forth the procedures and standards for the preparation and submittal of preliminary and final plats.

1.2	Authority
The Franklin Municipal Planning Commission (FMPC), is responsible for adopting, administering, and amending the Subdivision Regulations, per the authority granted by
the Tennessee General Assembly by Title 13, Section 13-3-101 through Section 13-3-304
and Section 13-3-401 through Section 13-3- 411 of the Tennessee Code Annotated (T.C.A.), as amended, and other pertinent statutes for the establishment of regulations governing
the subdivision of land.

1.3	Applicability
These Subdivision Regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the corporate limits of the City of Franklin, hereafter referred to as the City.

1.4	Adoption and Effective Date These regulations are effective as of the date amended by the FMPC as of December 12, 2019 and effective as of December 30, 2019. The Subdivision Regulations were initially adopted, on April 12, 1966 and became effective on April 15, 1966. Any area of land recorded by deed prior to April 12, 1966 is a lot of record.
 
The FMPC may from time to time amend these regulations by appropriate action taken at a regularly scheduled meeting after the required notice and holding of a public
hearing. A thirty-day public notice of the date, time, and location of the public hearing shall be published in a daily newspaper of general circulation. An amendment becomes effective when the FMPC approves it, unless otherwise noted.

1.6	Conflicts
Whenever there is a conflict between minimum standards or dimensions in the Subdivision Regulations and those contained in other adopted codes, ordinances, standards and specifications, or plans, the more restrictive standard shall apply.

1.7	Validity
If any section, clause, paragraph, provision or portion of these Subdivision Regulations
shall be held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, paragraph, provision or portion of these regulations.
