PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the Code, as supplemented through June 16, 2016, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
    Ordinances enacted prior to October 2016 and prior versions of the Code used fractions to designate chapters or sections that were interposed between sequentially numbered sections. After October 2016, the Code uses decimal numbers to interpose new sections between sequentially numbered sections. All previously used fractions in Chapter numbers are converted to decimals. For example, previously numbered Chapter 71/2 is renumbered Chapter 7.5 and Section 71/2-1 is renumbered Section 7.5-1. Further interposition of new chapters will be numbered sequentially using decimal designations. To maintain the order of the Code, previously designated Chapter 251/4 is renumbered Chapter 25.2. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President of Supplementation, and Peggy Lamar, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Melanie Po'e for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

Pending the passage of any such resolution or ordinance, or during the time intervening between the final passage of any such resolution or ordinance and the expiration of thirty days, during which publication shall be made as above provided, the legally qualified voters of said city may, by written petition or petitions, addressed to the city council, object to such grant; and if, during said period, such written petition or petitions signed by such number of the legally qualified voters of such city as equals in number, at least fifteen per centum of the votes cast for the candidate receiving the highest number of votes in the last preceding regular election in said city, shall be filed with said council, said council shall forthwith order an election, at which election the legally qualified voters of said city shall vote for or against said grant, as set forth in said resolution or ordinance. 
In the call of said election, the said resolution or ordinance making said grant, shall be published in said city by one publication in one of its newspapers, or, if no newspapers are published in the city, in some newspaper of general circulation therein; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to any person, firm or corporation which has, at the time of the passage of this Act, already an unexpired franchise granting to him, them or it, right to use the said streets, public highways, thoroughfares, or public property of the city; and by virtue of said franchise have a bona fide contract with said city for the use of same. 
If, at any such election the majority of the votes cast shall be in favor of said ordinance or resolution, and the making of said proposed grant, the same shall thereupon become effective; but if a majority of the votes cast shall be against the passage of the said resolution or ordinance, and against the making of the said grant, the said resolution or ordinance shall not become effective, nor shall it confer any rights, powers, or privileges of any kind, and it shall be the duty of the city council, after the result of said election shall be determined, to pass a resolution or ordinance to that effect.

Section 26 - Initiative and referendum generally. 
That any ordinance may be proposed and submitted to the city council for adoption, by a petition signed by such number of the legally qualified voters of the city as equals in number fifteen per centum of the votes cast for the candidate receiving the highest number of votes in the last preceding regular election of the city, requesting said council to pass such ordinance. Likewise, any ordinance for the repeal or amendment of any ordinance hereafter adopted by the city council, or heretofore passed and still in force and effect in the City of Murfreesboro by reason of the terms of this Act, may be submitted to the city council by a petition signed by a like number of the qualified voters of the city, requesting the council to pass such repealing or amendatory ordinance. Any such proposed or repealing or amendatory ordinance shall be passed upon one reading by the council at its first regular meeting coming after the submission of any such petition, and then referred to the qualified voters of the city for their approval or disapproval, in an election called, and held at the time to be fixed, by the city council; but no such election shall be called for a date coming before thirty (30) days after the date on which such ordinance is passed upon such first reading. 
In all cases, where any proposed or repealing or amendatory ordinance is submitted to the council by petition, as aforesaid, such ordinance shall be filed with the city recorder, upon its passage by the council as aforesaid, and shall be published, together with the petition, at least one time in some newspaper published in the City of Murfreesboro, or, if there be no such newspaper, then in some newspaper in general circulation therein, at least two weeks before the holding of the election at which it is to be submitted to the voters of the city as hereinabove provided. The costs of such publication shall be paid by the city. 
In any election held under this section, if the majority of the votes cast in any such election are in favor of the adoption of any such proposed or repealing or amendatory ordinance, such fact shall be shown by proper entry upon the minutes of the council, and the council shall thereupon proceed to pass such ordinance upon its second and third readings. If the majority of the votes cast in any such election are against the adoption of any such ordinance, such fact shall be shown by proper entry upon minutes of the council, and such ordinance shall not take effect; and the council shall not pass or adopt any similar or substantially similar ordinance for a period of thirty days after the holding of any such election, nor shall the council submit any such similar or substantially similar ordinance to the qualified voters of the city for their approval or disapproval within a period of six (6) months after the holding of any such election. 
Provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section contained, the city council may adopt any such proposed or repealing or amendatory ordinance without referring the same to the voters of the city for approval or disapproval; and provided, further, that no ordinance making an appropriation or fixing a tax levy shall be referred to the voters of the city, under the provisions of this section, and neither the repeal nor amendment of any ordinance, affected under the provisions of this section, shall in any manner impair, invalidate or affect any contract or property right that may have been acquired or which may have become vested under and by virtue of any such ordinance while the same remained unrepealed or unamended. 
Section 27 - Authority of council to submit ordinances to voters for approval or disapproval. 
That the city council may, upon its own initiative and in its discretion, submit any new ordinance or any ordinance repealing or amending any ordinance to the qualified voters of the city for their approval or disapproval by an election called, and held at the time fixed, by the council, for the purpose. The city recorder shall publish the proposed ordinance in the same manner provided in section 26 of this Act, and the result of any such election shall be noted upon the minutes of the council, and subsequent action taken thereon, as provided in section 26 of this Act. 
Section 28 - Requirements relative to elections pertaining to ordinances, election of members of council, etc., generally.

The expenses and costs of any such election shall be paid by the city. 
In all such elections, as well as in all elections of members of the city council, the ballot shall be prepared by said election commissioners, in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the State of Tennessee and the provisions of this Act, and shall be on plain white paper, and shall contain no mark or insignia indicating the contents of said ballots, or distinguishing any ballot from any other ballot in any such election.

The voter in voting in elections to elect members of the council shall place a cross mark before or after the name of the candidate or candidates he desires to vote for; but no voter shall mark such cross mark at the names of more candidates that there are offices to be filled in said election. In voting for the adoption or rejection of an ordinance or resolution, he shall place a cross mark either before or after the words on said ballot indicating his/her choice or vote on any such ordinance or resolution. 
Any number of such ordinances or resolutions may be voted upon at the same election, in accordance with the provisions of this section, but in event there are more ordinances or resolutions than one submitted in the same election, the ballots used shall be the same as hereinbefore provided, except such necessary words shall be above the words "for adoption" and "against adoption" as will indicate which ordinance or resolution is meant, and these words shall be repeated above the quoted words as many times as the quoted words appear upon the ballot, thus indicating clearly in each instance which ordinances or resolutions the voter is voting for or against. 
No informalities in conducting any election under this section shall invalidate it if such election is conducted fairly and in substantial conformity with the requirements of this section.

The city tax assessor shall include in the assessment rolls all assessments made by the Tennessee Public Service Commission that may be taxable for city purposes, under the laws of the state. 
No assessment shall be invalid because the size, dimensions, boundaries, or other description of any tract, lot or parcel of land shall not have been precisely named or given, nor because the amount of the valuation or tax is not correctly given, nor because the property has been assessed in the name of a person who did not own the same, nor because the same was assessed to unknown owners, nor on account of any objection or informality merely technical, but all such assessments shall be good and valid and parol evidence may be admitted, received and considered to supply any such error or defect. The city council shall have power to correct any errors in the tax assessments upon a certificate filed by the city tax assessor or city recorder. 
The city council may by ordinance or resolution fix and change the due date and delinquent date of all taxes due the city, and may provide for the payment of taxes in quarterly, semi-annual or such other installments as it may deem advisable and for a discount for the prompt payment thereof. And in order to enforce collection of taxes on property or other taxes when due, the city council is empowered by ordinance or resolution to provide that delinquent taxes of the city shall bear interest from after the delinquent date thereof at not exceeding the legal rate of interest and, in addition thereto, to provide that a penalty of not exceeding one-half of one per centum for each month such taxes are delinquent shall be added to the amount of such taxes on the first day of each month, such interest and penalty to be paid by the taxpayer, and to be collected as city taxes are collected, and all liens and remedies for the collection of city taxes shall be applicable to the collection of such interest and penalty. 
The city recorder shall have power and authority, and it shall be the duty of said city recorder, to pick up and assess all omitted taxes on property and all privileges and other taxes; and said pickup and assessment of taxes on omitted property shall be made upon a notice of five days to the owner or agent, if it is practicable to give such notice within the county (provided, however, that the person against whom any such assessment is made may waive such notice); but the city recorder shall have no power to assess omitted property, privileges, or other taxes for a longer period than three years prior to the current year; and provided that penalty and interest on such assessments of omitted property and taxes shall not be added to the amount of tax to be paid on such assessments, unless taxes for the year for which such assessments are made are due and delinquent, and then only for months coming after the making of such assessments. If the owner is dissatisfied with the assessment of such omitted property as made by the city recorder, such owner shall have the right of appeal to the board of city tax equalization; but said appeal must be taken within ten days of the assessment of such omitted property by the recorder; and the action of the board of city tax equalization upon such appeal shall be final, as in cases of the other equalizations by said board; and said board shall certify its action on all such appeals to the city recorder. 
The assessment rolls and tax books of the city, and the delinquent lists (which the city recorder is hereby authorized and empowered to furnish, in the same manner as such lists are furnished by county trustees in the case of delinquent state and county taxes, to the officers hereinafter in this paragraph mentioned), as to all taxes remaining delinquent for thirty days, shall have the force and effect of a judgment and execution from a court of record in the state, and shall be full, complete and ample authority for the officers having such taxes for collection to distrain and sell sufficient amount of the personal property of the delinquent taxpayer to satisfy his or her taxes, interest, penalties and costs; and the city recorder shall have power to issue distress warrants, and alias and pluries distress warrants, in the name of the State of Tennessee on behalf of the City of Murfreesboro, to enforce the collection of all taxes, privileges, assessments, and interest and penalties thereon. Such warrants may be executed by the sheriff or any deputy sheriff or constable of the county in which the City of Murfreesboro is situated, the chief of police of the city or by the city tax collector hereinafter provided for, and the officer or officers to whom such warrants are issued may also proceed against the delinquent taxpayers by garnishment proceedings, entitled in the name of the State of Tennessee for the use of the City of Murfreesboro, and returnable before any justice of the peace of the district where the delinquent resides or of the district in which the City of Murfreesboro is situated. For each collection of such delinquent taxes, there shall be allowed the same fees and commissions, as compensation for such collection, as are allowed by the general laws of the state to officers for the collection of delinquent state and county taxes; and, in case of a levy or garnishment, there shall be allowed, as additional compensation for each such collection, the fees allowed by law in such cases, all of which fees, commissions and costs shall be paid by the delinquent taxpayer. In addition to the remedy by distress warrant and garnishment proceedings, the city may also collect any delinquent taxes on property, privileges, and assessments and other taxes, with all interests and penalties thereon, by suit at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
Assessed taxes on realty, and all interest and penalties thereon, shall be and remain a lien on the property until the same are paid, whether or not a bill be filed or other procedure taken for the collection thereof. A bill or bills in equity may be filed, under the direction of the city attorney, in the chancery court of the county in which the City of Murfreesboro is situated, to enforce the lien of such taxes, but no such bill shall be filed before the first day of January of the second year after the year for which said taxes are assessed. Upon the filing of any such bill, an additional penalty of ten per centum upon the amount of delinquent tax shall accrue and be imposed upon the amount due from any taxpayer and shall be allowed to the attorney filing such bill as compensation for his services. 
Any such bill filed in equity may include as many as twenty-five distinct pieces or tracts of land, the owners thereof being made defendants to the bill and such cause shall not be subject to objection for misjoinder by reason of such several and distinct interests, or because publication has not been made of delinquency. 
All parties necessary to enable the court to enforce the lien and divest the title out of the owner or owners and vest the same in the purchaser may be made parties defendant. 
Should any person interested pay the tax, interest, penalty and cost, after the bill has been filed and before the sale of the land, the city, by its city attorney, shall dismiss the suit as to such person and property. 
Each person shall pay his proportionate part of the cost, which shall be the same as provided by law in the case of bills filed to enforce the lien of state and county taxes. 
The bills herein provided for shall be in substance and in form the same as other bills in the chancery court for the purpose of foreclosing and enforcing liens and collecting taxes, assessments and money due under lien and for divesting title and making title. 
No defendant shall be entitled to a copy of the bill without applying to the clerk of the court and paying for such copy. 
It shall not be necessary that all defendants' names be included in the copy of the subpoenas to be left with said defendants or in publication for any nonresident defendants. 
The cause shall be at issue as to any defendant when his answer is filed or pro confesso has been taken. It may be proceeded with by or against any one or more of the defendants until final judgment, sale and confirmation of title, without in any way affecting any other defendant to the suit. 
Any party to the bill shall have the right to an appropriate appeal to the supreme court or court of appeals, or shall have the right of writ of error, as their right in such proceedings may be, and such appeal shall not affect the proceedings as to other parties. 
The City of Murfreesboro shall have the same remedy or remedies, in this section provided, for the collection and the enforcement of the lien, of any taxes, privileges, and other taxes assessed in said city prior to the passage of this Act and remaining uncollected at the passage of this Act.

(4)  If the RFQ or/and RFP process is used for architectural or engineering services, the purchasing agent shall seek information from any firm licensed in Tennessee relevant to their qualifications and experience relative to the scope of the work, the complexity of the work, the professional disciplines required to satisfactorily perform the work and the estimated value of the services to be rendered.

(Ord. No. 90-23 § 1, 05-31-90) 
Section 2-188 - One-for-one replacement units. 
(A)  Replacement units. The City will replace all occupied and vacant occupiable low/moderate-income dwelling units demolished or converted to a use other than as low/moderate-income housing as a direct result of activities assisted under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (CDBG and UDAG, Section 108), as described in 24 CFR 570.606(b)(1). 
All replacement units will be located within the jurisdiction of the City. 
Replacement low/moderate-income dwelling units will be designed to remain low/moderate-income dwelling units for at least ten years from the date of initial occupancy and will be in standard condition. The units may include, but are not limited to, public housing, existing housing receiving Section 8 project-based assistance and units raised from substandard to standard condition through the City's housing rehabilitation programs. 
The units must be sufficient in number and size to house at least the number of occupants that could have been housed in the units that are demolished or converted. 
Examples of activities which would require replacement units include demolition of vacant units when: 
(1)  the demolition is funded in whole or in part with CDBG funds; 
(2)  if rented, the units would rent for less than the FMR; and, 
(3)  the units are suitable for rehabilitation. 
(B)  Timeframe; required information. All replacement housing will be provided within three years of the commencement of the demolition or rehabilitation relating to conversion. Before obligating or expending funds that will directly result in such demolition or conversion, the City will make public and submit to the HUD field office the following information in writing: 
(1)  a description of the proposed activity; 
(2)  the general location on a map and approximate number of dwelling units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be demolished or converted to a use other than for low/moderate-income dwelling units as a direct result of the assisted activity; 
(3)  a time schedule for the commencement and completion of the demolition or conversion; 
(4)  the general location on a map and approximate number of dwelling units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be provided as replacement dwelling units; 
(5)  the source of funding and a time schedule for the provision of dwelling units; and, 
(6)  the basis for concluding that each replacement dwelling unit will remain a low/moderate-income dwelling unit for at least ten years from the date of initial occupancy. 
(C)  Funding. The one-for-one replacement provisions are effective for all CDBG funds obligated after the fiscal year 1989 CDBG grant is made to the City, regardless of the source year of the funds used for the activity. For Section 108, UDAG and the Secretary's Discretionary Grant, the provisions apply to all grants made on or after October 1, 1988. 
(Ord. No. 90-23 § 1, 05-31-90) 
Section 2-189 - Relocation assistance. 
(A)  City assistance. The City shall provide relocation assistance to each low/moderate-income household that is displaced by demolition or by conversion of a low/moderate-income dwelling unit to another use as a direct result of an activity assisted under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended. 
(B)  Type of assistance. The low/moderate-income household may elect to receive relocation assistance described at 24 CFR Part 42 (HUD's regulations implementing the Uniform Relocation Act), or may elect to receive the following relocation assistance: 
(1)  the relocation assistance described at 24 CFR Part 42, Subpart C (General Relocation Requirements) and Subpart D (Payment for Moving and Related Expenses) relocation notices must be issued consistent with, and in the manner prescribed under, 24 CFR 42.203. Displaced households provided with replacement housing assistance in the form of a certificate or housing voucher under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 must be provided referrals to comparable replacement dwelling units whose owners are willing to participate in the housing voucher or certificate program. The City shall advise tenants of replacement housing opportunities in such a manner that, whenever feasible, they will have a choice between relocating within their neighborhoods and other neighborhoods consistent with the City's responsibility to affirmatively further fair housing, as required by the Federal Fair Housing Law, as amended in 1988 (Title VIII), also known as the Civil Rights Act of 1968; 
(2)  the reasonable and necessary cost of any security deposit required to rent the replacement dwelling unit and credit checks required to rent or purchase the replacement dwelling unit; and, 
(3)  households are eligible to receive one of the following forms of replacement housing assistance: 
(a)  Each household must be offered compensation designed to ensure that, for a five-year period, the displaced household will not bear, after relocation, a ratio of shelter costs to income that exceeds 30%. Such compensation shall be either: 
[1]  a certificate or housing voucher for rental assistance provided through the Murfreesboro Housing Authority under Section 8 of the United States Act of 1937; or, 
[2]  cash rental assistance equal to 60 times the amount that is obtained by subtracting 30% of the displaced household's monthly gross income (with such adjustments as the City may deem appropriate) from the lesser of the monthly cost of rent and utilities at a comparable replacement dwelling unit or the monthly cost of rent and utilities at the decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling to which the household relocates. The City shall provide the cash payment in a lump sum. The City shall not make this cash assistance available if the household rejects a Section 8 certificate or voucher. 
(b)  If the household purchases an interest in a housing cooperative or mutual housing association and occupies a decent, safe and sanitary unit in the cooperative or association, the household may elect to receive a lump-sum payment. This lump-sum payment shall be equal to the capitalized value of 60 monthly installments of the amount that is obtained by subtracting 30% of the displaced household's monthly gross income (with such adjustments as the City may deem appropriate) from the monthly cost of rent and utilities at a comparable replacement dwelling unit. To compute the capitalized value, the installments shall be discounted at the rate of interest paid on passbook savings deposits by a federally insured bank or savings and loan institution conducting business within the City's jurisdiction. To the extent necessary to minimize hardship to the household, the City shall, subject to appropriate safeguards, issue a payment in advance of the purchase of the interest in the housing cooperative or mutual housing association. 
(C)  Eligibility for relocation assistance. A low/moderate-income household that is required to move as a direct result of demolition or conversion of a low/moderate-income dwelling unit to another use is eligible for relocation assistance under subsection (B)(2) herein if: 
(1)  the household is required to move from the dwelling unit on or after the date that the owner submits a request to the City for financial assistance that is later approved for the requested activity. (This applies to dwelling units owned by a person other than a federal or state agency, as defined under the URA.); or, 
(2)  the household is required to move from the dwelling on or after the date of the initial submission of a final statement under 24 CFR 570.302(a)(2) (Entitlement Grants). (This applies to dwelling units owned by a federal or state agency as defined under the URA.) 
If the displacement occurs on or after the date described above, the low/moderate-income household is not eligible for relocation assistance if: 
(1)  the household is evicted for cause; 
(2)  the household moved into the property on or after the above date, after receiving written notice of the expected displacement; or, 
(3)  the grantee determines that the displacement was not a direct result of the assisted activity and the HUD office concurs in that determination. 
If the displacement occurs before the date described above, the low/moderate-income household is eligible for relocation assistance if the City or HUD determines that the placement was a direct result of an activity assisted in this section. 
(Ord. No. 90-23 § 1, 05-31-90) 
Section 2-190 - Anti-displacement strategy. 
(A)  Local policies. Consistent with the goals and objectives of activities assisted under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, the City's anti-displacement strategy is built upon local policies that: 
(1)  recognize that displacement is a potentially serious problem in reinvestment neighborhoods; 
(2)  seek to minimize displacement in CDBG program areas to the greatest extent practical; 
(3)  in those areas where displacement is unavoidable, ensure that assistance is provided to displacees; 
(4)  provide mechanisms to promote awareness, communication and participation among government, neighborhoods and the private sector; and, 
(5)  ensure that community development programs are designed, implemented and evaluated in a manner that minimizes potential displacement and assists displaces. 
(B)  Actions and recommendations. The following mitigative actions will be undertaken and recommendations pursued to minimize displacement and provide assistance in those instances where displacement is unavoidable. These actions and recommendations are aimed at making it easier for lower-income residents to remain in their neighborhoods via programs to increase homeownership opportunities and rental assistance, sensitively administer Code enforcement, subsidize rehabilitation costs and increase the supply of safe and affordable housing. The actions and recommendations that follow are not comprehensive, but rather provide the foundation for a local anti-displacement effort to be updated and refined on an ongoing basis by all interest groups. 
(1)  Housing Rehabilitation Financing. In order to assure that the benefits of revitalization will be received by existing low/moderate-income residents, CDBG financing will continue to be structured so that even very low-income homeowners can afford needed repairs. By making rehabilitated housing affordable, it will not be necessary to displace low/moderate-income homeowners in order to achieve neighborhood revitalization. Programs will also be carried out to rehabilitate rental property that will be affordable to low/moderate-income tenants. This will help provide a needed supply of decent, affordable rental housing in CDBG neighborhoods and enable existing tenants to remain in their neighborhoods. 
(2)  Temporary Relocation. Temporary relocation assistance will be provided for homeowners and tenants when required to carry out the rehabilitation work. Assistance includes moving, storage, and rent when needed. 
(3)  Code Enforcement. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of displacement necessitated by CDBG-assisted Code enforcement activities, the City remains flexible and sensitive in its enforcement of the Codes. Emphasis is placed on correcting basic safety and health violations, with the unique needs of the property owners and tenants taken into account. 
(C)  Condemnation. If a house is determined unfit for human habitation, it is condemned and the occupants are so notified. They are also informed about programs which may provide them with suitable replacement housing. If they would like to rent through Section 8 or conventional public housing, the Community Development office will notify the Murfreesboro Housing Authority of the tenant's displaced status and thus the tenant will receive priority for rental assistance programs.

If plastic or oversize bags are used, the grass or leaves will not be collected. It shall be unlawful to place grass or loose leaves on the sidewalk, in the street, in a storm drainage ditch or so near a storm drainage ditch that grass or leaves will float into the City storm drainage system. No grass or leaves, loose or in bags, shall be placed in the automated garbage collection system refuse container.

(1)  Automated garbage collection system refuse containers. Each owner or occupant using or occupying any building, dwelling unit, or structure shall utilize refuse containers approved by the Solid Waste Department for the storage and collection of refuse and no other container. Refuse containers shall be issued by the City and shall remain the property of the City. Refuse containers shall remain at the address where delivered and shall not be removed from the premises by any person. Markings and identification on the refuse containers shall not be defaced, altered, or removed. 
(2)  Duty to maintain refuse containers. Refuse containers shall be maintained by the occupant of the premises in good, clean and sanitary condition. If a refuse container is damaged in the course of normal and reasonable usage, or is damaged, destroyed or stolen but not through abuse, neglect, or improper use by the occupant, the refuse container shall be repaired or replaced by the City at no charge. Refuse containers which are damaged, destroyed, or stolen through neglect, improper use, or abuse by the occupant shall be replaced by the City at the expense of the occupant or the owner. Only one change in cart size (from standard to small or from small to standard) shall be allowed per year. The substitution shall be without charge only if the container to be exchanged is in good, usable condition. 
(3)  Volume of refuse. Refuse placed in the refuse container shall not exceed 96 gallons or 200 pounds for a standard size cart. If a smaller cart is used, the volume of refuse shall not exceed 64 gallons or 100 pounds. If a dwelling unit regularly exceeds the gallon or pounds limitation, the occupant or owner of the dwelling unit may be required to pay for one additional refuse container by the City Manager. The cost for an additional refuse container will be the same as the purchase price then paid by the City and shall be paid by the occupant or owner. The City will own the additional refuse container; however, in the event the occupant relocates in the City, the occupant may take the second refuse container to the occupant's new location in the City, except in the case of an occupant who is a tenant and the landlord paid the purchase price for the second refuse container. The City will not provide free collection services for more than two refuse containers per dwelling. 
(4)  Use of automated refuse container. All refuse must be placed inside an automated refuse container and the lid closed. Refuse will not be picked up if the refuse container lid is not closed flat or if the refuse is placed outside the refuse container or is propped up against the refuse container except during the Christmas period of December 26 through January 9. The City will not pick up refuse unless it is properly stored within a closed automated refuse container unless a waiver has been issued by the City. 
(5)  Refuse containers if automated garbage collection system is not used. Should any citizen be unable to comply with these requirements and need reasonable accommodation pursuant to the Americans With Disabilities Act or otherwise, the citizen must submit a written request to the Director of the Solid Waste Department. If the Solid Waste Department determines that the automated garbage collection system is not appropriate for use at a particular location, the owner or occupant shall use plastic bags with a minimum strength of two mills and a minimum capacity of 20 gallons and a maximum capacity of 30 gallons. Each bag must be securely tied at the top and must not contain more than 40 pounds of refuse. The maximum refuse collected for each residence or apartment unit not using the automated refuse container shall be three 30-gallon bags or any combination thereof. If the Solid Waste Department determines that an alternate site or method of pickup is appropriate, the designation shall be changed and a record of such change, and the conditions justifying the change, shall be maintained. 
(C)  Storing of refuse. 
(1)  No person shall place any refuse in any street, alley, or other public place, or upon any private property whether owned by such person or not, within the City unless it is in proper containers for collection or under express approval granted by the City Manager, nor shall any person throw or deposit any refuse in any stream or other body of water. 
(2)  Any unauthorized accumulation of refuse on any premises is hereby declared to be a nuisance and prohibited. Failure to remove any existing accumulation of refuse within 30 days after the effective date of this article shall be deemed a violation of this article. 
(3)  No person shall cast, place, sweep, or deposit anywhere within the City any refuse in such a manner that it may be carried or deposited by the elements upon any street, sidewalk, alley, sewer, parkway or other public place, or into any occupied premises within the City. 
(D)  Collection area. Refuse containers shall be placed for collection in the area designated on each property by the Solid Waste Department. Usually, this placement designation shall not be on a public sidewalk, in a public street, or in a drainage ditch. Containers shall be placed in the designated area so as to be readily accessible for removal by the City through the automated garbage collection system. 
(E)  Time of collection. Refuse containers shall be placed for collection in the designated area no earlier than 7:00 P.M. on the day before the designated collection day. In order to insure collection on the collection day, all refuse containers should be at their designated collection area by 7:00 A.M. on the collection day. A refuse container is to be removed from the collection area on the collection day and shall be stored out of sight from the public street.

The purpose of the Recycle Murfreesboro Ordinance is to provide flexibility in developing and implementing recycling plans in the City, a means to protect our environment, a means to prolong the life of landfills, a means to preserve our natural resources, a means to prevent waste, and an alternative means of disposing of refuse.

Any plan developed by the City Manager in cooperation with any public or private organization, corporation, or individual shall be subject to the approval of the Council after a public hearing has been advertised a minimum of ten days in a local newspaper. Copies of the plan will be available at City Hall for inspection and review by the public for a minimum of ten days prior to the public hearing. The Council may alter or amend the plan following the public hearing. A plan may be approved by resolution. When applicable, all requirements for the grant of a franchise must be satisfied.

Section 14-205 - Dropoff centers. 
(A)  The recycling plan may involve dropoff centers. The dropoff centers plan may involve an exclusive franchise for a portion or all of the City. The plan may permit the use of City property (such as City schools or fire halls) for collections points. The plan may involve the City actually providing the collection containers. The plan may provide an exclusive franchise for all existing and new dropoff centers within the designated territory for a designated period of time. Any such plan must address the matter of cleanup, maintenance, publicity, and regular collection of recyclable materials. The plan should address the availability of a market for the recyclable materials collected. 
(B)  If there is no existing franchise, and there are two or more applicants for the same franchise, a not-for-profit organization will be favored over a for-profit organization or individual, all other things being equal. If a for-profit organization or individual has an existing franchise, then it will have priority over all other applicants for the same franchise, provided all other things are equal.

In other words, an exclusive grant of franchise under this article which involves voluntary recycling will not in any way impair, impede, or limit the ability of free enterprise to establish a buy-back center. 
(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90) 
Section 14-208 - Anti theft and anti-scavenger provision.

ARTICLE II. - SPECIAL EVENTS 

Section 21-61 - Purpose. 
The occurrence in the City of special events, including parades, not only provides a public amenity that enhances the character of the City, but also provides a method of personal expression and enjoyment to the citizens of the City. The City seeks to encourage such activities to the extent that they do not interfere with the reasonable expectations of residents to the enjoyment of peace and quiet in their homes or to the ability of businesses to conduct their business uninterrupted. This article seeks to balance the interests of personal expression and enjoyment of such activities with those of the residents and businesses of the City through the use of consistent, non-discriminatory and uniformly approved standards.

An incomplete application will be returned to the applicant and will not be considered for approval. Review and consideration of the application may include, but is not limited to, the following criteria: 
(1)  Whether the conduct of the special event would be likely to so substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic within the City on and contiguous to the proposed location so as to create a danger to the health, safety, and welfare of the pedestrians, cyclists and vehicle drivers of the City or substantially interfere with construction projects; 
(2)  Whether the conduct of the special event would be likely to create a danger to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City by preventing firefighting equipment, ambulances, rescue vehicles, first response vehicles, and/or police vehicles from being able to reach any property in the City; 
(3)  Whether the concentration of persons, animals, and vehicles gathering for the special event or at assembly points for a parade would be likely to unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection or ambulance services to areas contiguous to such assembly areas; 
(4)  Whether a special event permit application for the same time and location is already granted or has been received; 
(5)  Whether a special event permit application for a similar date and time has been granted or has been received, and whether police resources required for the other special event are so great that in combination with the subsequent proposed application, the resulting deployment of police services would likely have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons or property; 
(6)  Whether, if the applicant proposes for the erection or placement of any structure or markings, whether permanent or temporary, on a City street, sidewalk or right-of-way, such applicant has obtained advance approval for the placement of the structure or markings from the City Council, Planning Commission, or other appropriate City department. 
(7)  Whether the applicant or the person or organization on whose behalf the application is made has on a prior occasion damaged City property, violated the terms and conditions of a City permit, or has outstanding debts to the City. 
(8)  Whether the application contains a material falsehood, misrepresentation or omission. 
(B)  Nondiscrimination. The City shall uniformly consider each application for a special event permit upon its merits and shall not discriminate in granting or denying permits under this article based upon political, religious, ethnic, race, disability, or gender related grounds. The viewpoint of the applicant or the content of the special event shall not be a basis for approval or denial. 
(C)  Approval. Approval of a special permit application can be subject to conditions and requirements not requested by the applicant. These conditions, requirements and changes can include, but are not limited to: requirements for crowd and/or traffic control (e.g. barricades, warning devices, law enforcement personnel); solid waste services and containers; sanitary facilities; security personnel; inspections of electrical and mechanical equipment; and modifications to the location(s) or hours requested. The City shall not specify or require that any such service or equipment be provided by the City. The approval of a special use permit can be rescinded or revoked before the event by the City Manager for any reason which would have justified its denial and, on the day of the event, by the Police Department as specified in § 21-67(F). In the event of any such rescission or revocation, the applicant shall have only the right to appeal the rescission or revocation on the same basis as a denial as specified in § 21-67(A) and shall have no other rights or claims. 
(D)  Denial. If the City Manager denies, in whole or in part, a special event permit application, the reasons for the denial shall be identified with reference to narrow, objective and definite standards in this article or in another City ordinance, resolution, policy or standard, with which the proposal would conflict. No denial shall be arbitrary, capricious or without factual basis. Denials may be time, place and manner specific as an activity at one time or location may pose a different traffic or other risk than the same activity at a different time or location.

The fee and charges may vary in amount or be waived if the City is a co-sponsor of the event. 
(F)  Revocation of permit. The Police Department shall have the authority to revoke a special event permit instantly upon violation of the conditions or standards for issuance set forth in this article or when a public emergency arises where the police resources required for that emergency are so great that deployment of police services for the special event would have an adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons or property. In such case of permit revocation, the Police Department will make reasonable efforts to notify the persons responsible for the special event as far in advance of the revocation as is practicable.

Section 21-105 - Sound measurement procedures. 
(A)  Sound Measurement Equipment. 
(1)  All sound level measurements made by the City pursuant to this Article shall be made using a sound level meter in good operating condition and that meets the requirements of a Type 1 or Type 2 instrument, as described in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) S1.4 2014 "Sound Level Meters", as it exists as of the effective date of this Article or as such requirements are hereafter amended. 
(2)  Acoustic calibrators used to calibrate a sound level meter should be those recommended by the manufacturer of the sound level meter. 
(3)  Each sound level meter used in connection with the enforcement and administration of this Article must be recalibrated and the acoustic calibrator must be recalibrated at least once per year by the manufacturer or by a laboratory accredited for such calibrations by either the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation or the National Institute of Standards and Technology. A copy of written documentation of such recalibration shall be kept with the equipment to which it refers. 
(B)  Operating conditions during sound measurement. Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions including, but not limited to, design, maximum and fluctuating rates. 
(C)  General requirements. All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The Noise Control Officer shall, to the extent practicable, identify and document all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement. Prior to taking any noise measurements, the Noise Control Officer shall explore, as is reasonable under the circumstances, the vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to measure the sound from the source in question. 
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in this Article, measurements shall be taken at or near the nearest real property boundary of the property receiving the alleged offending sound. 
(3)  The Noise Control Officer shall conduct an external calibration of the sound level meter using an acoustic calibrator immediately before and after a series of measurements at each test site. The Noise Control Officer shall also conduct a calibration check at least once every hour during the measurement period to ensure continuing accuracy of the meter. 
(4)  Unless the sound level meter's manufacturer specifications allow adjustments to be made to compensate for the following factors, no outdoor measurements shall be taken: 
(a)  During periods when the wind speed (including gusts) exceeds 15 miles per hour; 
(b)  Without a windscreen, recommended by the meter's manufacturer, properly attached to the meter; 
(c)  Under any condition that would cause the meter to become wet, such as rain, snow, fog, or condensation; or 
(d)  When the ambient temperature is out of the meter's range of tolerance. 
(5)  No measurement may be taken on private property without the permission of the owner or the owner's representative or, in the absence thereof, without a search warrant or court order. 
(6)  During measurement, the meter and microphone must be taken from a distance of at least three feet above the ground or from any reflective surface, including the wall, floor, or ceiling of any structure or any interior room. 
(7)  When conducting interior sound level measurements, all sound sources within the residence, dwelling unit or other interior space in which the measurement is being taken that can reasonably be discontinued (e.g., television, stereo) shall be discontinued. Exterior doors and windows may be opened or closed, at the discretion of the Noise Control Officer. 
(8)  If the microphone is handheld, it must held at arm's length and be pointed at the alleged offending sound source at the angle recommended by the meter's manufacturer. 
(9)  If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs that are unrelated to measurements increase the monitored sound levels, the measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest. 
(10)  The measurement period should be sufficient in length to ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question. Except when measuring sound levels associated with an impulsive sound, in no event shall the duration of testing be less than one minute. 
(11)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, when the location or distance prescribed in this Article for measurement of sound is impractical or would provide misleading or inaccurate results, measurements may be taken at other locations or distances using appropriate correction factors specified in this Article or the latest version of ANSI S1.4 2014. 
(D)  Equipment settings. When using a sound level meter to enforce the provisions of Code § 21-106, the Noise Control Officer shall utilize the settings specified below for the specific type of sound being evaluated. 
(1)  Non-impulsive sounds. Except as set forth otherwise in this Article, the sound level of a sound that is sustained for more than one second at a time and shall be measured using the A-weighting scale and the fast response settings on the sound level meter, unless otherwise specified in the most recent version of ANSI S1.4-2014. 
(2)  Measurement of impulsive sounds. The sound level of an impulsive sound shall be measured using the C-weighting scale and peak/impulse settings on the sound level meter, unless otherwise specified in the most recent version of ANSI S1.4-2014. 
(3)  Measurement of sounds with significant low-frequency components. The sound level of a sound with significant low-frequency components, e.g., certain sound amplification devices and heavy equipment or machinery, in addition to being measured in accordance with subsection (1), may also be measured using the C-weighting scale and the fast response setting on the sound level meter for purposes of establishing compliance with the applicable sound level limits. 
(E)  Adjustment for background interference. 
(1)  Wherever possible, the background sound level should be measured at the same location on the receiving property used to measure the alleged offending noise source. Background sound levels shall be taken using the same weighting scale as being evaluated and the fast response setting on the sound level meter. 
(2)  If the source of interest can be turned off, the Noise Control Officer shall subtracted the background sound level from the measured sound levels of the source(s) of interest (i.e., ambient sound level) by using Table 1 to determine the sound levels from the source(s) of interest alone. 
Table 1 Difference between ambient and
background levels Correction factor to be subtracted from
ambient level to
determine source level 3 3 4-5 2 6-9 1 10 or more 0  
(3)  If the intruding noise source cannot reasonably be discontinued or stopped for a period of time sufficient to allow the measurement of the background sound level, the background sound level may be determined by the decibel reading traveling away from the noise source to a point where a steady-state decibel reading is achieved. 
(F)  Reporting requirements. 
(1)  The Noise Control Officer shall complete a report for each measurement session on forms approved by the Chief of Police and Chief Building Official. The report for each measurement session should include such facts as may be necessary to demonstrate that a violation has occurred, including: 
(a)  The date, day of week, and times at which measurements are taken; 
(b)  The times of calibration; 
(c)  The weather conditions, including wind speed and temperature; 
(d)  The identification of all monitoring equipment by manufacturer, model number, and serial number; 
(e)  A description and/or sketch of the measurement site, including measurement locations and relevant distances and other information sufficient for another investigator to repeat the measurement under similar conditions; 
(f)  A description of the sound(s) in question; 
(g)  The measured sound levels, including the minimum, maximum (or peak), and mean sound levels, measured to the nearest decibel, and duration(s) of the sound(s) in question; 
(h)  The ambient sound level with the source(s) in question operating and a description of other sound sources contributing to the ambient sound level, if obvious; and 
(i)  The background sound level without the source(s) in question operating. 
(2)  Information required to support the issuance of a citation shall be considered sufficient if the data captured by the sound level meter provides such information, and/or such information can be provided by the citation and/or the testimony of the Noise Control Officer taking such readings, and/or such other reports generated by the Noise Control Officer.

Section 21-106 - Sound level limitations. 
(A)  Unlawful sound levels. 
(1)  It is unlawful for any person to cause sound, or for any person in possession of real or personal property to permit sound originating from such property, to intrude into the real property of another person whenever such sound exceeds the sound level limits established in this section. 
(2)  No violation of this section shall exist if the alleged offending noise source cannot be demonstrated to increase the sound level at the measurement point by at least three dBA over the background sound level, provided, however, that if it is not possible to determine the background sound level, a violation of this section shall be deemed to exist if the sound level measured while the source is in operation exceeds the applicable maximum sound limits. 
(3)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever a violation of this section may be established using the equivalent A-weighted sound level (LeqA) or equivalent C-weighted sound level (LeqC) associated with a sound, the minimum period for taking such measurements shall be at least one minute for steady sounds and 15 minutes for a non-steady sound (including quasi-steady, intermittent, and fluctuating sounds). 
(B)  Exterior sound level limits. 
(1)  No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of any sound source within the City in such a manner as to create: 
(a)  A steady or quasi-steady sound whose sound level exceeds the limits set forth for the receiving land category in Table 2 when measured at or within the real property boundary of the receiving land; 
(b)  A fluctuating or intermittent sound whose sound level exceeds the limits set forth for the receiving land category in Table 2 for more than 15 minutes in a 60-minute period when measured at or within the real property boundary of the receiving land; 
(c)  Any sound whose equivalent A-weighted sound level (LeqA) exceeds the limits set forth for the receiving land category in Table 2 when measured at or within the real property boundary of the receiving land; 
(d)  Any sound whose sound level exceeds the ambient level by at least 10 dBA during daytime hours or by at least 5 dBA during nighttime hours when measured at or within the real property boundary of the receiving land; or 
(e)  An impulsive sound, occurring less than four times in an hour, whose peak level (Lpk) exceeds 100 dBC during daytime hours or 80 dBC during nighttime hours. Impulsive sounds occurring four or more time in an hour shall be measured as continuous sound and shall be deemed a quasi-steady sound required tom meet the requirements set forth in subsection (a).

(2)  If a dwelling unit or noise-sensitive zone is located within a nonresidential zone of the City, the nonresidential sound level limit shall normally apply for purposes of enforcing subsection (1) above, unless: 
(a)  the Murfreesboro Police Department receives a complaint, and 
(b)  the dwelling unit or noise-sensitive zone predates the noise source, in which case, the sound level limit applicable to the sound complained of shall be: 
(i)  in a commercial zone, the sound level limit in Table 1 less 5 dBA, regardless of the time of day; and 
(ii)  in an industrial zone, the sound level limit in Table 1 less 5 dBA between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., and less 10 dBA between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
(3)  The maximum permissible sound level that may be emitted from any lot containing a nonconforming use shall be the same as that permitted for the most restrictive zone in which the use would be conforming. 
(4)  When a sound source can be identified and its sound measured in more than one zone, each of the appropriate sections shall apply at the boundaries between zones. 
(5)  When property of the receiver is unoccupied, as in the case of any undeveloped lot, sound levels in excess of those specified herein, shall be considered only as a technical violation of the standard. No citation shall be issued in such instances, nor is corrective action required to reduce the sound generated by the sound source. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, where a particular activity, sound source, or device is subject to decibel level limits and requirements specifically prescribed for such activity, source, or device elsewhere in this Article, the decibel level limits set forth in this subsection shall not apply to such activity, sound source, or device. 
(C)  Indoor sound level limits applicable to multi-family dwellings. 
(1)  No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of any sound source within a dwelling unit, common area, or utility room of a multi-family dwelling in such a manner as to create a sound whose A-weighted sound level when measured from inside a dwelling unit within the same building exceeds: 
(a)  the indoor sound level limit specified in Table 3 for a cumulative period of more than five minutes in any hour; 
(b)  the indoor sound level limit specified in Table 3 plus 5 dBA for a cumulative period of more than one minute in any hour; or

Table 3 Time Sound Level Limit - dB(A) 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. 45 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. 40  
(2)  Notwithstanding the standards set forth in subsection (1), if the measured ambient sound level in the receiving dwelling unit exceeds the sound level limit specified in Table 2, a noise disturbance shall be deemed to exist if the equivalent A-weighted sound level when measured in the receiving dwelling unit exceeds the ambient sound level by ten or more dBA between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., or five or more dBA between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the standards set forth in subsections (1) through (2), above, any sound originating in a multi-family dwelling unit or common area that is plainly audible in another dwelling unit between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. shall constitute prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection. Evidence establishing that the sound level did not in fact exceed the standards established in subsections (1) through (2) shall constitute an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of this subsection. 
(D)  Sound amplification devices; maximum permissible increase in background sound level within a residential property. 
(1)  No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of a sound amplification device in such a manner that the sound emanating therefrom intrudes upon the interior of a residence or dwelling unit and raises the background sound level by more than the permissible sound level limits set forth in Table 4 when measured within the residential property.

Section 1303 System Requirements 
1303.1 Materials 
Pipe materials shall conform to Section 605.4. 
1303.2 Identification 
All re-purified system piping must be purple in color and labeled "NON-POTABLE - DO NOT DRINK" in black lettering. The purple color must be integral to the material of all pipes, pipe fittings, and appurtenances. Painted pipe, fittings, or appurtenances will not be accepted. The labeling must be permanently applied to the pipe, by either integrating into the pipe during the manufacturing process or by use of a permanently attached label. This label shall be no further apart than four feet on center. If the selected material cannot be manufactured with the required integrated purple color, then a permanent adhesive tape with the purple background and the required lettering must be secured to the entire length of the pipe. The required lettering must be placed so that it is readily visible on at least two sides if the pipe were to be exposed. 
1303.3 No cross-connections. There shall be absolutely no cross-connection between the re-purified system and the potable water supply system. This includes, but not limited to: air gaps, back-flow preventers or any other cross-connection control device. 
1303.4 Coloring. The re-purified water system shall have a permanent, automatic system that will inject a blue colored dye into the re-purified system. This device must be connected to the re-purified system as it enters the building and before any branches of the system. A check-valve and a separate stop valve shall be installed on the re-purified system prior to the connection of dye system, in order to prevent dye from entering the public portion of the re-purified supply system. 
1303.5 Signs. Permanently attached signs stating "CAUTION - NON-POTABLE WATER" shall be placed at the shut off valve for each connected fixture and inside the tank of all tank-type water closets. For urinals said signs shall be placed on the wall directly above the urinal and no higher than eighteen inches above the top of the urinal itself. These signs must be constructed of non-corrosive material with the lettering permanently integrated into the sign." 
(II)  For purposes of determining and enforcing requirements of this code relating to the sizing building roof and storm drains, the rainfall rate design value of 3.3 inches per hour, based on a one-hundred-year hourly rainfall rate, shall be used.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Section 25.2-1 - Intent and purpose. 
(A)  Regulation of the location, size, placement and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the City without difficulty and confusion, to encourage the general attractiveness of the community, and to protect property values therein. Accordingly, this chapter is enacted to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will: 
(1)  Promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, morals and convenience; 
(2)  Promote aesthetics in the City; 
(3)  Protect the environment; 
(4)  Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the City by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs, and thereby encourage increased communication with the public; 
(5)  Restrict signs and lights which overload the public's capacity to receive information or which increase the probability of traffic congestion and accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision; 
(6)  Reduce conflict among signs and lights and between public and private information systems; and 
(7)  Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings, are appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain, and are expressive of identity of proprietors and other persons displaying signs. 
(B)  As these or any regulations can only establish the mechanical limits of signage and not enforce a level of visual quality in sign design, anyone planning a sign is strongly encouraged to consider: 
(1)  The character of the proposed sign, not only in and of itself but also in terms of the effects such a sign will have upon the character of the surrounding area. 
(2)  The way in which the sign will be read, and whether its size, location, configuration and character are appropriate to its intended audience or whether a more appropriate sign could better serve its intended purpose and, at the same time, be less visually disruptive. 
(3)  The character of the sign structure, that is, the physical means of supporting the sign, and whether that structure could be made an integral part of the sign rather than a separate and frequently distracting element. 
(C)  The underlying intent and structure of the Murfreesboro Sign Ordinance is that only those types, sizes, locations and illuminations of signs that are specifically identified in the subsections of Code § 25.2-26 may be constructed, erected, applied or maintained within the City of Murfreesboro, and that all others are prohibited. Notwithstanding this intent and structure, certain types and sizes of signs are specifically prohibited for clarity and emphasis. This underlying intent and structure allows the City to study new techniques and new technologies and then determine whether, and if so to what extent, they should be allowed to be incorporated into signs within the City. It is not possible to specifically prohibit or even to regulate that which has not yet been brought to the attention of City officials or that which has not been invented or even conceived. Accordingly, the Chief Building Official's authority to render interpretations as provided in Code § 25.2-3(E) includes the authority to determine whether or not a new, evolved, extended or improved process, technique or technology is sufficiently similar to an allowable type of sign to be allowed under this Sign Ordinance, or whether such a new, evolved, extended or improved process, technique or technology should be deemed prohibited until approved by the City Council. 
(D)  Automated or electronic changeable signs are defined in this ordinance as "Changeable sign - automated changeable copy," "Changeable sign - electronic graphic display," "Changeable sign - multi-vision" and "Changeable sign - video display;" these definitions may be amended or superseded from time to time in the future. Because the nature of automated or electronic changeable signs (without regard to the specific method or mechanism of effecting a change), the intensity of use afforded by automated or electronic changeable signage, the potential for inappropriate intrusion into and abuse of the public streets and rights-of-way by automated or electronic changeable signage, and the public welfare and safety concerns raised by automated or electronic changeable signage, all automated or electronic changeable signage is declared to be a "use" that is separate, different and distinct from the "use" of or resulting from a permanent, fixed sign face of print or design on or of paper, plastic, glass, wood, metal, vinyl or any other opaque or translucent material. 
(E)  Excepting only as specifically provided in Code § 25.2-24(A)(12), nothing in this Chapter 25.2 shall be construed to regulate or to authorize the regulation of the content or the message of any sign. Rather, this Chapter 25.2 addresses the size, height, location, construction, lighting, display technology, and other such aspects of signage. 
(F)  Except as may be expressly and specifically stated to the contrary in this Chapter 25.2, all provisions of this Chapter 25.2 apply equally to commercial and to non-commercial signs and signage. Nothing in this Chapter 25.2 shall be construed to prefer commercial message over non-commercial message signage. 
(Ord. No. 90-36 § 1, 08-16-90; Ord. No. 10-O-32 § 1, 09-30-10) 
Section 25.2-2 - Definitions; interpretation. 
(A)  Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein.

An attached sign must be attached to the area occupied by the applicant, except the name of the business, trademark, logo, and/or tradename may be on a sign no larger than two square feet attached at or near the street or sidewalk public entrance when the applicant's space in the subject building does not front on the street or sidewalk used as a public entrance; and, provided further that when two or more such tenants and/or businesses utilize this provision, the design and format for all such signs shall be compatible (size, style and color) so as to appear as a commercial complex sign. An attached sign may not extend beyond any limits of the surface to which it is attached, provided that an attached sign that is mounted parallel to the surface to which it is attached shall be mounted so that the sign face is not more than 18 inches away from the surface to which it is attached.

A building material sign shall not protrude from the exterior surface of the building more than four inches. A building material sign shall not be internally illuminated; nor shall it be enclosed or accented with outline lighting or string lighting. A building material sign may be externally illuminated, provided that the light source is four or more feet from the sign.

A canopy sign must be attached to a side of a canopy and cannot be larger than 50 square feet. 
"Changeable sign - automated changeable copy:" A sign or portion thereof that is visible from a public right-of-way and that displays letters, numbers, characters, symbols, graphics or illustrations, (i) which are not themselves any illumination device, and (ii) which may be changed or re-arranged by computer or microprocessor generated electronic commands, which commands may be programmed to change at pre-determined intervals or may be activated by an operator from either a proximate or a remote location. Automated changeable copy signs include devices referred to as "flip matrix," "segmented," and "scrolling," and other devices with substantially similar functionality and appearance. 
"Changeable sign - electronic graphic display:" A sign or portion thereof that is visible from a right-of-way and that displays electronic, static images, static graphics or static pictures, with or without textual information, which are created by matrix elements which may include cathode ray tubes (CRTs), light emitting diodes (LED's), liquid crystals (LCD's), plasma, fiber optics, light bulbs or other illumination devices within the display area, or are created by any reflective, refractive, digital light processing (DLP), holographic, stereoscopic/three dimensional, or any other device, process, product, application of technology, or by the appearance of any of such, within the display area, either alone or in varying combinations with each other or other elements, where the message change sequence is accomplished immediately or by means of fade, repixalization, dissolve or other such modes devices, processes, products, applications or technologies. Electronic graphic display signs include computer programmable, microprocessor controlled electronic or digital displays which may change automatically at predetermined intervals or be changed by an operator from either a proximate or a remote location.

"Changeable sign - multi-vision." A sign that is visible from a public right-of-way and that is composed in whole or in part of a series of vertical or horizontal slats or cylinders that are capable of being rotated at intervals so that partial rotation of the group of slats or cylinders produces a different image and when properly functioning allows the sequential display of one of two or more images on a single sign structure. May also be known as "tri-vision" signs. 
"Changeable sign - video display." A sign or portion thereof, that is visible from a public right-of-way, with or without textual information, which is created by matrix elements which may include cathode ray tubes (CRTs), light emitting diodes (LED's), liquid crystals (LCD's), plasma, fiber optics, light bulbs or other illumination devices within the display area, or are created by any reflective, refractive, digital light processing (DLP), holographic, stereoscopic/three dimensional, or any other device, process, product, application or technology, or by the appearance of any of such within the display area, either alone or in varying combinations with each other or other elements, that changes its message or image or background in a manner or method of display (i) which includes the appearance of motion, movement or animation, (ii) which depicts action or a special effect to imitate motion, movement or animation, or (iii) which includes the presentation of light or images displayed in a progression of frames or other such so as to give the illusion of motion, movement or animation, including but not limited to the illusion of moving objects, moving patterns or bands of light, or expanding or contracting or otherwise altering shapes.

(a)  The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the petitioner, the owner of the property on which the sign is to be erected or affixed, the owner of the sign, and the person to be erecting or affixing the sign. 
(b)  A description of the requested variance. 
(c)  Justification of the requested variance. 
(d)  The location of the building, structure or zoning lot on which the sign is to be erected or affixed. 
(e)  If variance involves a ground sign, a site plan of the property involved, showing dimensions of the lot, improvements thereon, accurate placement thereon of the proposed sign. 
(f)  A blueprint, ink drawing or photograph of the sign involved. 
(g)  The written consent of the owner or lessee of the building, structure or property on which the sign is to be erected or affixed. 
(h)  Such other information as the Chief Building Official may require to determine full compliance with this and other applicable ordinances of the City.

(C)  Board of Zoning Appeals, public hearing; timing and attendance. Not more than 45 days after an application for a variance is filed, the BZA shall hold a public hearing thereon. Written notice of such hearing shall be given to the person who filed the application and to such other persons as the BZA deems advisable. The petitioner and Chief Building Official and/or their authorized representatives shall attend those meetings of the BZA at which a variance is to be heard. 
(D)  Standards for variance. It is the intent of this chapter to use variances only to modify the application of any of the provisions of this chapter where there are practical difficulties or where unusual hardships may result. The BZA shall not grant a variance unless it makes findings based upon evidence presented it as follows: 
(1)  The conditions upon which the petition for a variance is based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same district. 
(2)  If the condition complained of by the appellant is a general or widespread condition, then a variance shall not be permissible. Financial factors alone shall not be considered as a basis for granting a variance. 
(3)  The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person having an interest in the property after the effective date of this chapter. 
(4)  The proposed variance will not increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety. 
(E)  Board of Zoning Appeals determination. The BZA may grant, deny, wholly or in part, or modify such variance request as it determines appropriate. 
(F)  Effect of denial. No requested variance which has been denied wholly or in part by the BZA in accordance with the provisions established herein may be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of such denial except on ground of new evidence or proof of changed conditions found to be valid by the BZA. 
(G)  Board of Zoning Appeals revocation. In any case where a variance has been granted, and where no work pertinent thereto has been initiated within six months (180 days) from the date of the BZA approval of the requested variance, then without further action by either the Chief Building Official or BZA, such variance shall become null and void. 
(H)  Maintenance of records. The Chief Building Official shall maintain complete records of all findings of fact and recommendations of the BZA and all determinations relative to variance applications. All such records shall be open to the public for inspection. 
(I)  Excepting only for variances related to locational issues applicable to all signs such as height limitations, location within an easement and setback requirements, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have no authority to grant any variance with respect to any prohibition, restriction, limitation or other regulation applicable to changeable signs.

(10)  Before any sign permit can be issued, any required electrical permit for the proposed sign must be issued by the Building & Codes Department. 
(11)  Applications shall be delivered in person, by mail, or electronically to the Sign Permit Application designee at the Building & Codes Department. Applications may not be accepted by any individual sign inspector. 
(C)  Review of application. Upon the delivery of an application for a sign permit to the Building & Codes Department, the Department will examine such application and the accompanying materials for completeness and compliance with this chapter. The Department will approve or deny the application within ten working days after a complete and compliant application is received. 
(1)  If it shall appear that the application is complete and in compliance with all of the requirements of this chapter and all other laws and ordinances of the City, the application will be assigned to a codes inspector for a location inspection. Upon approval of the location, the Department will approve the application and so advise the applicant. Any condition attached to the approval must be complied with in accordance with the stated condition; failure to comply with any stated condition will be grounds for denial or revocation of the sign permit. 
(2)  If it shall appear that the application is incomplete or in any manner not in compliance with all of the requirements of this chapter and all other laws and ordinances of the City, or if there is an objection to the location, the Department will deny the application and will advise applicant of the reason(s) for such denial. If the applicant elects to resubmit the application, the ten working day period to approve or deny the application will start anew upon receipt of the resubmitted application. The failure of staff to note an incompletion, objection or other deficiency or violation in a response to an applicant shall not preclude staff from raising such incompletion, objection or other deficiency or violation in a subsequent response. 
(D)  Issuance of permit. A sign permit shall not be issued until the application has been approved, any conditions stated in the approval have been satisfied, any required electrical permit has been issued, and any required permit fee has been received. Construction shall not begin until after issuance of sign permit. 
(E)  Inspections. It is the responsibility of the sign contractor to call the Department and request all required site, footing, final and any other inspections required by the sign permit. It is the responsibility of the electrical contractor, if any, to call the Department and request all required electrical inspections. Whenever any work is required to be inspected by this chapter, no additional work can be undertaken until the required inspection is completed and the work approved. If additional work is undertaken prior to an inspection, the sign contractor shall, at the sign contractor's expense, tear out, remove or demolish such additional work as may be necessary in order to conduct the required inspection, provided that the Chief Building Official may, in such Official's sole discretion, accept a letter of indemnity, in form and substance satisfactory to the Chief Building Official in lieu of such tear out, removal or demolition. The following inspections are ordinarily required, in appropriate circumstances: 
(1)  Location inspection. A location inspection is required for all ground signs and all freestanding wall signs prior to the approval of an application. The location inspection will be initiated by the Department whenever the application is determined to be complete. 
(2)  Footing or foundation inspection. A footing or foundation inspection is required whenever the sign and any support structure is more than 10 ft. in overall height or is larger than 40 sq. ft. This inspection must be completed before the concrete for the footing or foundation is installed. 
(3)  Electrical inspection. Electrical inspections are required in accord with the standards of the currently adopted version of the National Electric Code. 
(4)  Others. The City may require by notation on a sign permit any other or additional inspection that the Chief Building Official determines is reasonably necessary for the protection of health, safety and welfare, or to assure compliance with this Chapter. 
(5)  Final inspection. A final inspection is required at such time as all aspects of the sign structure and/or sign installation are substantially complete with nothing more than "punch list" items remaining. The sign message does not need to be installed on an allowable changeable sign prior to final inspection, but the face or mechanism upon which or by which the message will be displayed must be finally installed and operable. Unless otherwise specifically noted on the sign permit, landscaping required by a Site Plan or other such Planning or Zoning document does not need to be installed prior to final inspection. 
(F)  Expiration of sign permit. If work authorized under a sign permit has not been completed within 180 days after the date of issuance, the permit shall expire and immediately become null and void. Any work in process shall immediately stop and no additional work shall be initiated until a new sign permit is issued. The Chief Building Official may extend an existing sign permit under which substantial work has been accomplished before expiration. A new sign permit shall not be issued without a new application and payment of applicable fees. 
(G)  Schedule of sign permits and fees. No sign permit may be issued until the applicable fee, if any, has been paid. Sign permit fees shall be established and may be amended from time to time by resolution of the City Council. 
(H)  Final Inspection Deposit Agreement. At the time each sign permit is issued, the applicant shall sign a Final Inspection Deposit Agreement in form established by the Chief Building Official, which shall provide for the following: 
(1)  A cash deposit in the amount established by resolution as may be amended from time to time by the City Council. 
(2)  Refund of the deposit within ten working days after the work has passed final inspection. 
(3)  Refusal of the issuance of any new sign permits to or for the benefit of an applicant who appears to have completed work under an outstanding sign permit but has failed to have requested and passed a final inspection. 
(I)  Building permit. A separate building permit shall be required for the support structure of a freestanding wall sign whenever required by the currently adopted version of the International Building Code. 
(J)  Exceptions to fee requirement. The following sign permits shall be issued without a fee, but not without a Final Inspection Deposit Agreement: 
(1)  Permits for the demolition of any sign. 
(2)  Permits for replacement of a preexisting, permanent sign face with the same or a substantially similar sign face, provided that the owner or owner's designee delivers a Replacement Certificate in form provided by the Building & Codes Department. 
(3)  Permits for a banner in the Central Business District. 
(K)  Failure to obtain permit. In the event construction is started prior to the issuance of a sign permit, the permit fee otherwise due for the applicable sign permit shall automatically be doubled. 
(L)  Permit revocation. Unless it expires pursuant to this section, sign permits are valid for the life of the sign. However, it is the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the owner's architect or engineer and the owner's contractor(s) follow all applicable provisions of this Chapter in the design, construction and installation of a sign. The issuance of a sign permit or the passing of an inspection through inadvertence, mistake or oversight shall in no event be construed as waiving any provisions of this Chapter. Any sign permit may be revoked by the Chief Building Official upon determination that the sign is not in full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. 
(M)  Special provisions for flag signs and flagpoles. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Sign Ordinance to the contrary, the following permit and fee provisions shall apply to flag signs and flagpoles. 
(a)  No permit shall be required for any flag sign. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation or association to erect, prepare, alter or relocate within the City any flagpole as defined in this chapter on a lot without first obtaining a flagpole permit from the Building and Codes Department, provided, however, that no flagpole permit shall be required for a flagpole to be erected, prepared, altered or relocated on a lot which is lawfully being used for either a single family or two-family residential use, regardless of zoning district. No fee shall be required for the filing of an application for a flagpole permit or for the processing or issuance of a flagpole permit. 
(2)  Application for a flagpole permit shall be made upon forms provided by the Building & Codes Department and shall include all required information set forth below: 
(a)  Name, address and phone number of applicant. 
(b)  Name, address and phone number of owner. 
(c)  Name, address and phone number of contractor.

(h)  Attach drawing showing flagpole location, height or length, and flag size, together with the following, as applicable: 
[1]  For ground-mounted flagpoles less than 16 feet in height, two dimensional sketches showing the location of the flagpole on the site, the height of the flagpole and the shape and extended dimensions of the flag sign. The setbacks from rights of way and power lines shall be included, as well as the location of any underground or surface easements. 
[2]  For ground-mounted flagpoles 16 feet in height or more but less than 35 feet in height, two dimensional sketches showing the location of the flagpole on the site, the height of the flagpole and the shape and extended dimensions of the flag sign, and two dimensional sketches of the foundation of the flagpole. The setbacks from rights of way and power lines shall be included, as well as the location of any underground or surface easements. 
[3]  For ground-mounted flagpoles 35 feet in height or more, the same as subsection [2] above, except that all plans required must be drawn to scale and must be sealed by a registered Tennessee engineer (or pre-engineered by a flagpole manufacturing company) with wind loads specified in accordance with the applicable provisions of the adopted International Building Code, as amended. 
[4]  For wall-mounted vertical or outrigger flag poles, two dimensional plans showing the location and position of the flagpole with respect to the building or structure to which it will be attached, the height or length and angle of the flagpole, the shape and extended dimension of the flag sign, and the distance from the lowest point of the flag sign to the ground or other surface directly beneath such lowest point. Such plans must be drawn to scale and must be sealed by a registered Tennessee engineer (or pre-engineered by a flagpole manufacturing company) with wind loads specified in accordance with the applicable provisions of the adopted International Building Code, as amended. 
(i)  Before a flagpole permit can be issued, a copy of the application requesting an electrical permit for any proposed lighting must be obtained and filed with the flagpole permit application. A separate electrical permit will not be required if the lighting is included in any other electrical permit. 
(3)  Before any flagpole permit can be issued, the proposed location shall be marked by stake or other similar manner for a location inspection. 
(4)  All flagpoles must be erected, installed or attached in compliance with the applicable provisions of the adopted International Building Code, as amended. 
(5)  It shall be the duty of the codes inspector, upon the filing of an application for a flagpole permit, to examine such plans and specifications and other data regarding the proposal to erect the flagpole, and if it shall appear that the proposed flagpole is in compliance with all of the requirements of this chapter and of other applicable laws and ordinances of the City, the codes inspector shall make a location inspection. 
If it shall appear that the proposed flagpole is in compliance with all of the requirements of this Chapter and all other laws and ordinances of the City, the flagpole permit shall be issued within the next five working days after the location inspection. If the application is not in compliance with this chapter, then within the next five working days after the location inspection the building inspector shall advise the applicant of the refusal and the reason(s) therefore. 
After the issuance of a flagpole permit, the codes inspector will examine the premises for a footing inspection, provided that the flagpole is 16 feet or greater in height. It is the responsibility of the applicant or the applicant's contractor to call the Building and Codes Department to schedule a footing inspection if required by this Chapter, and construction shall not proceed until such inspection is made and the footing approved. 
Final inspections are required to be done by the codes inspector upon installation of the proposed flagpole. It is the responsibility of the applicant or the applicant's contractor to call the Building and Codes Department to schedule a final inspection if required by this Chapter, and an electrical inspection, if required. 
(6)  Upon approval of a final inspection of a flagpole, the Building and Codes Department may apply, or may provide for application by the applicant, a label bearing the number of the flagpole permit. Any such label shall be affixed to the flagpole in such a manner that the permit number will be readily visible for inspection purposes. 
(7)  The Chief Building Official may order that any flagpole erected or constructed without a permit after the effective date of this provision be removed.

Section 25.2-21 - Districts and zoned districts defined; sign map adopted. 
All signs permitted to be constructed, erected and maintained under this chapter shall be permitted only in the designated districts. "District" or "zone district," when used herein, shall be and mean those areas which are zoned as and identified as such in the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance adopted January 19, 1984, as amended, and as may be amended hereafter. For further reference and for further identification of the "districts" and "zoned districts," the official zoning map of the City, as amended, and as may be amended hereafter, and which is a part of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, is incorporated and adopted herein by reference, as if set forth verbatim. The map or a copy of the same shall be on file for reference for the administration of this chapter in the building inspector's office. 
(Ord. No. 90-36 § 4, 08-16-90) 
Section 25.2-22 - Computation of sign area, number, height, power line setback and other setbacks. 
(A)  In computing the area of all signs permitted under this chapter, the same shall be computed as follows: 
(1)  When two signs of the same shape and dimensions are mounted or displayed back-to-back and parallel, only one such face shall be included in computing the total display surface area of the sign. When two signs of the same shape and dimensions are mounted or displayed in a V-shape, not back-to-back and parallel, each such face shall be included in computing the total display surface area of the sign. 
(2)  The display surface area of an attached sign consisting of word(s), image(s), logo(s) or trademark(s) that are painted on, attached to or otherwise affixed to a surface such as a wall, window, or any other surface not specifically designed to serve as a sign background, and are not enclosed by a box or outline, shall be the sum of the area(s) within an imaginary rectangular box around each word, image, logo or trademark, with the size of the box being the area within same, calculated by multiplying the height by the width, without regard to whether or not the wall, window, or other surface not specifically designed to serve as a sign background is internally illuminated, externally illuminated, or non-illuminated. The height of the box shall be the vertical distance between the tallest and lowest letter or image in the word; or the distance between the top and bottom of an image, logo, or trademark which is not part of a word. The width shall be the horizontal distance between the outermost distant letter(s), image(s), logo(s), trademark(s) or combination thereof within a word; or the horizontal distance between the outermost edge of any image, logo or trademark not a part of a word. 
(3)  The display surface area of a sign consisting of connected letters or letters word(s), image(s), logo(s) or trademark(s) enclosed by a box or outline of any kind shall be the total area of the sign including the background, box or outline. 
Example: 

(4)  The display surface area of a multifaced sign shall be one-half (1/2) of the sum of all surface area forming a part of the display. 
(B)  In computing the number of attached signs permitted under this chapter: 
(1)  When more than one word, image, logo, or trademark is attached to one elevation of a building and they are not enclosed by a box or outline EITHER: 
(a)  each word, image, logo or trademark may be considered as a separate attached sign, with the display surface area of each such sign being calculated as specified in subsection (A)(2) herein; OR 
(b)  two or more of the words, images, logos, or trademarks may be considered as one attached sign, with the display surface area of the sign being calculated as the area within an imaginary rectangular box around the combination of the two or more words, images, logos, or trademarks, calculated by multiplying its height by its width. 
(i) = 2 attached signs with display surface areas of 15 square feet and 16 square feet respectively for a total of 31 square feet (ii) = 1 attached sign with a total display surface area of 48 square feet The applicant may choose the method of computation.  
(2)  When more than one word, image, logo or trademark is attached to one elevation of a building and they are enclosed by a box or outline of any kind, each area so enclosed or outlined shall constitute one attached sign, with the display surface area of each such sign calculated as described in subsection (A)(3) herein. 
(C)  Height measurement. Sign height shall be measured from the ground at the center of the sign to the highest point of the highest element of the sign, excluding any incidental structural element. However, when calculating the minimum height of a sign, the measurement is to the lowest part of the sign face; and, when calculating the minimum height of a canopy, the measurement is to the lowest part of the canopy that is not part of a support. 
(D)  Clearance from electrical power lines. The closest part of a sign shall not be any closer than eight feet horizontally from a vertical line above and below the nearest primary conductor(s). The closest part of a sign shall not be any closer than eight feet horizontally from a conductor not attached to the sign. As an exception to the foregoing, when the measurement is from the sign to an insulated secondary conductor not exceeding 600 volts, no portion of the sign may be within eight feet of the insulated secondary conductor measured horizontally, vertically or diagonally. A convenience sign under three feet in height may be placed under a power line. 
(E)  When (i) a zone lot is adjacent to a frontage road satisfying the conditions herein, has a minimum of 100 feet frontage on the frontage road, and the principal entrance to the building faces the major thoroughfare; (ii) the permissible square footage of the signage varies based upon the distance from the street right-of-way such as in Code § 25.2-26(C)(4)(b)(1); (iii) there is a frontage road substantially parallel to a major thoroughfare, which major thoroughfare is a minimum of four lanes; and, (iv) the frontage road right-of-way is adjacent to the major thoroughfare right-of-way, then for the purpose of measuring the distance from the street right-of-way in order to determine the maximum number of square feet of attached signage, the right-of-way of the major thoroughfare shall be used rather than the right-of-way of the frontage road. When the right-of-way between the frontage road and major thoroughfare is indistinguishable, then the frontage road shall be assumed to have a 50-foot right-of-way and the centerline of the frontage road is presumed to be the center of the frontage road right-of-way for purposes of measurement. 
(F)  For purposes of measuring the distance between any sign and a residential zone as may be required by this ordinance, the entirety of a PUD district shall be deemed to be a non-residential zone.

Section 25.2-25 - Temporary signs. 
(A)  Purpose of temporary sign regulations: Limited temporary signs are allowed in order to provide reasonable opportunities for communication while protecting the aesthetics of the City and avoiding confusion and clutter. With respect to the provisions regarding temporary "directional signs" contained in this ordinance, the City acknowledges the need of businesses and other organizations and individuals (collectively, "Speakers") to communicate the time and place of individual, isolated events that often occur at a place other than the Speaker's usual place of business or occupancy, as well as the public's need to know of the time and place of such events. As a result, such temporary directional signs, and only such temporary directional signs, are allowed, with limitations, to be placed off-site, but only on private property with the consent of the property owner. 
These signs are allowed to be off-site in order to provide communication that is effective for both the Speaker and the public. 
The limitations are necessary in order to avoid confusion to the public and clutter. If temporary directional signs are placed too far in advance of the event the information is more likely to be forgotten or confused with other information. If temporary directional signs remain in place any substantial period of time after the event, they will cause confusion and additional, unnecessary distraction to the public that has to sort through expired information in order to find information as to current or upcoming events. Limiting the duration of temporary directional signs will improve the efficient flow of traffic and contribute to public safety. While all signs contribute to visual clutter, a sign that no longer serves a purpose is purely visual clutter. 
(B)  All temporary signs are subject to the following general regulations: 
(1)  The total number of temporary signs shall not exceed three signs per lot at any one time. 
(2)  Any temporary sign placed on, in or over any private property must have the consent of the property owner. 
(3)  Any temporary sign placed on, in or over any public property, including public rights-of-way must have the written consent of the public authority having jurisdiction over the property. 
(4)  Changeable sign: A temporary sign, other than a sandwich board sign under subsection (E)(8) hereof, shall not consist, in whole or in part, of any form of changeable sign as defined in Code § 25.2-2. 
(5)  Temporary signs shall not be allowed to deteriorate to a tattered, torn or faded condition and shall be attached properly at all times. Either condition shall be repaired or the temporary sign shall be removed within two days of receipt of written notice. 
(6)  Temporary signs found to be in violation of this Sign Ordinance shall be removed within two days after posting of notice on the sign or after personal contact with owner or lessee of the property. If such sign, including support structures, is not removed after the conclusion of such period, the Chief Building Official is hereby authorized to cause the sign to be removed forthwith at the expense of the owner or lessee. 
(7)  Unauthorized temporary signs found in the R.O.W. may be removed without notice. 
(8)  Where allowed, all electrical lights or fixtures utilized with respect to any temporary sign must be installed in accordance with the National Electric Code, as currently adopted. 
(9)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Sign Ordinance, with the advance written consent of the pole owner and with City Council approval, non-commercial temporary pennants may be displayed on utility poles in the R.O.W. of: 
(a)  West Main Street and East Main Street between the CSX/West Main Street crossing and N. Rutherford Blvd.,

(c)  Greenland Drive between Middle Tennessee Blvd. and Blue Raider Drive, and,

(2)  Height - 50 ft. maximum. 
(3)  Size - 775 sq. ft. maximum. 
(4)  Setback - 5 ft. minimum from street or interstate right-of-way and 200' maximum from interstate right-of-way. 
(5)  Spacing - 1,000 ft. minimum to any other off-site permanent sign in both directions on the same side of interstate or street. 1,000 ft. minimum of an interchange or intersection at grade, measured along the interstate from the nearest point of the beginning or ending of pavement widening at the exit or entrance to the main-traveled way. 
(B)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or curtail noncommercial speech in favor of commercial speech. A person may erect a sign in conformity with this section that is used in whole or part for noncommercial speech. 
(C)  For the purpose of this chapter, a sign shall not be considered as off-site signage in the following circumstances: 
(1)  The parcel where the sign is proposed to be located ("accessory parcel") is separated only by a public right-of-way from the parcel on which the business or development that is advertised on the sign is located ("dominant parcel"); 
(2)  The accessory parcel is shown on the approved subdivision plat as part of the same zone lot as the dominant parcel and is to be improved only by the sign and/or a parking lot and/or landscaping; 
(3)  That for the purposes of this chapter in calculating entitlement to signage, (i) the accessory parcel is considered as a portion of the dominant parcel, (ii) the two shall be treated as one zone lot, and (iii) the business or development is not entitled to any additional number of signs or amount of signage because the accessory parcel is a part of the dominant parcel. The eligible signage will be based only on the conditions of the dominant parcel; and, 
(4)  Should the owner/occupant ever wish to treat the accessory parcel and dominant parcel as two zone lots, or to build a structure (other than a sign) on the accessory parcel, the sign must be removed from the accessory parcel; and same shall be a condition of approval of the subdivision of the accessory parcel and dominant parcel into two zone lots. 
(D)  A Development ID sign shall not be considered as an "Off-site Permanent Sign" if the lot upon which it is located is a part of the Development (as identified in this Chapter 25.2) which the sign identifies, regardless of the ownership of such lot. 
(Ord. No. 90-36 § 10, 08-16-90; Ord. No. 92-33 § 10, 07-23-92; Ord. No. 97-O-76 § 1, 04-30-98; Ord. No. 10-O-40 § 22, 12-09-10) 
Section 25.2-28 - Sign maintenance and other specifications for erection and maintenance of signs.

(B)  Structure maintenance. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, all signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys and anchors, shall be kept in good, safe repair and, unless plastic, shall be galvanized or noncorroding metal, and shall be maintained in good and safe condition including the periodic application of paint or other weatherproofing material to prevent rust or other decay. The Chief Building Official and/or representative may order the removal of any sign that is not so maintained in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(D)  Banners, flags, pennants, streamers. Banners, flags, pennants and streamer signs shall not be allowed to deteriorate to a tattered, torn or faded condition and shall be attached properly at all times. The condition shall be repaired or removed within thirty days of receipt of notice. 
(Ord. No. 90-36 § 11, 08-16-90) 
Section 25.2-29 - Nonconforming signs and other provisions. 
(A)  Purpose. For the purpose of promoting aesthetics, protecting the environment, and regulating excess signage, encouraging the positive economic development of the City, promoting the safety of the traveling public, protecting existing property values in both residential and nonresidential areas, preventing overcrowding of land, promoting a positive community appearance as part of a concerted citywide effort to protect and enhance the aesthetics of the City for the enjoyment of all citizens, the nonconforming signs are herein regulated. 
These regulations are designed to prevent a public nuisance through the overconcentration, improper placement and excessive height, bulk, enlargement, number and area of signs. It is intended that outdoor advertising signs be located away from residential areas, and that such signs be regulated to protect the character of the area wherein signs are located and to conserve property values in these areas. 
(B)  Extension or expansion. A nonconforming sign shall not be enlarged, expanded, extended or structurally altered so as to create an additional nonconformity or to increase the extent of the existing nonconformity when the change is declared a nuisance by this chapter. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the changing of the message panel, provided there is no increase in the face area or height or change in the face panel enclosing members. Nothing herein allows a nonconforming sign to be placed nearer to a right-of-way property line or power line than permitted by this chapter. 
(C)  Replacement or relocation. No nonconforming sign shall be removed and replaced or reconstructed on a different lot of record unless the replacement or reconstructed sign conforms to all applicable provisions of this chapter. Any sign violation of the National Electric Code or located in whole or part on the public right-of-way is an unlawful nonconforming sign and shall not be replaced or altered unless it conforms with all provisions of this chapter. 
(D)  Area and height. No nonconforming sign shall be removed and replaced or reconstructed on the same lot of record unless it conforms with the height and signable area limitations set forth below. A nonconforming sign that is removed and replaced or reconstructed on the same lot of record is declared to be a public nuisance if the sign area or height exceeds the following in the zones and areas indicated: 
(1)  Commercial highway or industrial zones where the sign is more than 200 ft. from residential zones: 
(a)  Interstate Highway: 
[1]  Interstate on-site: 
Nuisance if: > 345 sq. ft. 
> 138 ft. in height. 
[2]  Off-site: 
Nuisance if: >891 sq. ft. 
> 58 ft. in height. 
[3]  On-site ground sign: 
Nuisance if: >345 sq. ft. 
> 40 ft. in height. 
(b)  4-lane federal aid primary highway: 
[1]  Off-site: 
Nuisance if: >480 sq. ft. 
> 58 ft. in height. 
[2]  On-site: 
Nuisance if: >345 sq. ft. 
> 40 ft. in height. 
(c)  Other highways and streets: 
Nuisance if: >345 sq. ft. 
> 40 ft. in height. 
(2)  Commercial highway or industrial zones where sign is within 200 ft. from residential zone: 
(a)  Interstate highway: 
[1]  Interstate on-site: 
Nuisance if: >345 sq. ft. 
> 19 ft. in height. 
[2]  Off-site: 
Nuisance if: >891 sq. ft. 
> 19 ft. in height. 
[3]  On-site ground sign: 
Nuisance if: >345 sq. ft. 
> 19 ft. in height. 
(b)  4-lane federal aid primary highway: 
[1]  Off-site: 
Nuisance if: >460 sq. ft. 
> 19 ft. in height. 
[2]  On-site: 
Nuisance if: >345 sq. ft. 
> 19 ft. in height. 
(c)  Other highways and streets: 
Nuisance if: >345 sq. ft. 
> 19 ft. in height. 
(3)  All other zones other than residential zones: 
Nuisance if: >115 sq. ft. 
> 19 ft. in height unless flag which may be 35 ft. in height. 
(4)  Residential zones: 
Nuisance if: >69 sq. ft. 
>19 ft. in height unless flag which may be 35' in height. 
NOTE: The symbol ">" means "greater than". 
(E)  Attached signs. Attached signs in all zones shall be considered a nuisance if they exceed the signable area and height as provided in Code § 25.2-26 by 15% or more. 
(F)  Due process hearing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any owner of a nonconforming sign who believes that the foregoing limitations in paragraph (D) unduly restrict the ability to replace or reconstruct a nonconforming sign and that the sign is not a nuisance shall be entitled to a public hearing before the City Council. Notice of the public hearing will be published in the newspaper at least ten days prior to the meeting of Council. All interested persons shall be entitled to be heard at the public hearing on whether or not a nuisance in fact exists from the proposed expansion or replacement of a nonconforming sign. Nothing herein limits the right of the sign owner to a hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided by law. 
(G)  Abandoned nonconforming signs. Abandonment of any sign shall terminate the right to maintain such sign and the owner thereof shall be required to remove the sign. Any nonconforming sign shall be considered abandoned in the following situations, regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon or of an intent to reserve the right to use the sign: 
(1)  An abandoned on-site or off-site permanent sign is a sign displaying no advertising message for a period of one year or more if the permanent sign is located within 200 ft. of an interstate highway or 120 days otherwise. Copy on the sign indicating the sign is for lease or sale shall not be construed as the display of an advertising message for the purpose of this chapter. 
(2)  Signs which advertise a terminated activity, business, product or service which has not been produced, conducted, sold or performed on the premises where the sign is located for a period of one year or more if the permanent sign is located within 200 ft. of an interstate highway or 120 days otherwise. 
(H)  Ground sign made nonconforming by the resubdivision of property. A ground sign that conformed to the provisions of the Sign Ordinance at the time it was installed, and was subsequently made nonconforming in whole or in part by: 
(1)  the subsequent resubdivision of the lot upon which it is located into two or more lots, or 
(2)  the subsequent combination by resubdivision of the lot upon which it is located with and into another lot, shall be considered a legal nonconforming sign, provided that such resubdivision causing such sign to become nonconforming occurred prior to November 19, 2015. 
Any ground sign that is made nonconforming by a resubdivision occurring after November 19, 2015, must be reconstructed, relocated or removed so that the sign and the lot conform to the provisions of the Sign Ordinance then in effect within 90 days of the date of recording the resubdivision plat. 
(Ord. No. 90-36 § 12-1, 08-16-90; Ord. No. 91-46 § 1, 09-12-91; Ord. No. 98-O-42 § 19, 10-15-98; Ord. No. 15-O-57 § 8, 01-07-16) 
Section 25.2-30 - Removal of certain signs. 
(A)  Permit requirements. Demolition of any permanent sign or sign structures requires a permit and fee (see Code § 25.2-20) except no fee shall be required if such demolition is being made in order to remove a legal nonconforming permanent sign. 
(B)  Notice to remove illegal nonconforming signs. If the Chief Building Official shall find that any sign does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, except for legal nonconforming signs, the Chief Building Official shall give written notice to the owner(s), agent or person(s) having the beneficial interest in the building or the premises on which such permanent sign is located. Removal of the permanent sign shall be effected within 90 days after receipt of the notice from the Chief Building Official. Removal of temporary signs shall be effected within two days after posting of notice on the sign or personal contact with owner or lessee. No notice will be given for temporary signs in the ROW. If such sign is not removed after the conclusion of such period, the Chief Building Official is hereby authorized to cause the sign to be removed forthwith at the expense of the owner or lessee. 
For the purpose of this subsection, the word "remove" shall mean: 
(1)  The sign face, along with posts, columns or supports of ground signs, shall be taken down and removed from the property. 
(2)  The sign face and supporting structures of "projecting", "roof" or "attached" signs shall be taken down and removed from the property. 
(3)  The sign face of "painted attached signs" shall be removed by painting over the wall sign in such a manner as to completely cover up and hide from sight the sign in question. 
(C)  Notice to remove abandoned signs. If the Chief Building Official shall find that any such permanent sign has not been removed within one year if the permanent sign is located within 200 ft. of an interstate highway or 120 days otherwise of cessation of a particular use, the Chief Building Official shall give written notice to the owner(s), agent(s) or person(s) having the beneficial interest in the building or the premises on which such sign is located. Removal of the sign shall be effected within ten days after receipt of notice from the Chief Building Official. If such sign is not removed after the conclusion of such ten-day period, the Chief Building Official is hereby authorized to cause the sign to be removed forthwith at the expense of the owner(s), agent(s), or person(s) having the beneficial interest in the building or premises on which such sign is located. For the purpose of this paragraph, "removal" shall mean total removal of the sign structure if the sign is nonconforming and only removal of the sign face if the sign is otherwise conforming. 
(D)  Notice to remove unsafe signs. If the Chief Building Official shall find that any sign is unsafe or insecure, or is a menace to the public, the Chief Building Official shall give written notice to the owner(s), agent(s) or person(s) having the beneficial interest in the building or the premises on which such sign is located. Correction of the condition which caused the Chief Building Official to give such notice shall be effected within ten days after receipt of the notice. If such condition is not corrected after the conclusion of such ten-day period, the Chief Building Official is hereby authorized to cause the sign to be removed forthwith at the expense of the owner(s), agent(s) or person(s) having the beneficial interest in the building or premises on which such sign is located. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the Chief Building Official is authorized to cause any sign to be removed upon giving reasonable notice under the circumstances at the expense of the owner(s), agent(s) or person(s) having the beneficial interest in the building or premises on which the sign is located, whenever the Chief Building Official determines an emergency exists and that such sign is an immediate peril to person or property of others. 
(E)  Appeal. The owner of a nonconforming or abandoned sign which has been the subject of a notice of violation may appeal by filing a notice of appeal pursuant to Code § 25.2-5 no later than ten days after receipt of notice. Failure to appeal in the time specified will constitute a waiver of all rights to an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Failure to request a due process hearing within ten days of the notice will constitute waiver of the right to an appeal when there is a right to a due process hearing. 
(F)  Annexation. Nonconforming signs located in areas annexed into the City shall be subject to the same provisions as nonconforming signs in existence when this chapter was initially passed. The following signs are required to be brought into compliance with these regulations within 45 days of the annexation: temporary signs, flashing, chasing and blinking lights. Signs of this type that exist in a nonconforming status after the time specified shall cause the sign to be removed at the expense of the owner(s), agent(s) or person(s) having the beneficial interest in the building.

ARTICLE I. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Section 27.5-1 - Purpose. 
This chapter is intended to manage the manner in which stormwater is addressed in areas of new development and redevelopment through the course of construction, post-construction stabilization, and permanently to maintain or benefit water quality, to provide measures against stream bank erosion and flooding, and thereby to benefit the quality of life and character of the City. This chapter sets general policy and stormwater management program direction and is supported and enforced through other more detailed regulations, which may be adopted by the City Council and relevant City departments. 
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Stormwater Management Ordinance of the City. The purpose of this chapter is to accomplish the following: 
(A)  Improve stormwater management; 
(B)  Control the discharge of pollutants to the stormwater system; 
(C)  Provide measures against stream bank erosion and flooding; 
(D)  Improve public safety; 
(E)  To comply with the City's NPDES permit; and, 
(F)  Allow the City to exercise the powers granted in T.C.A. § 68-221-1105, which provides that, among the other powers municipalities have with respect to stormwater facilities, is the power by ordinance or resolution to: 
(1)  Exercise general regulation over the planning, location, construction, and operation and maintenance of stormwater facilities in the City, whether or not owned and operated by the City; 
(2)  Adopt any rules and regulations deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes of this statute, including the adoption of a system of fees for services and permits; 
(3)  Establish standards to regulate the quantity of stormwater discharged and to regulate stormwater contaminants as may be necessary to protect water quality; 
(4)  Review and approve plans and plats for stormwater management in proposed subdivisions or commercial developments; 
(5)  Issue permits for stormwater discharges, or for the construction, alteration, extension, or repair of stormwater facilities; 
(6)  Suspend or revoke permits when it is determined that the permittee has violated any applicable ordinance, resolution, or condition of the permit; 
(7)  Regulate and prohibit discharges into stormwater facilities of sanitary, industrial, or commercial sewage or waters that have otherwise been contaminated; and, 
(8)  Expend funds to remediate or mitigate the detrimental effects of contaminated land or other sources of stormwater contamination, whether public or private.

"Flood protection elevation." The elevation which is one foot above the 100-year flood high water profiles according to FEMA maps developed for the Federal Flood Insurance Study for the City. The flood protection elevation is the crest elevation in relation to mean-sea-level (National Geodetic Vertical Datum - NGVD) expected to be reached during a flood which encompasses the regulatory or 100-year floodplain. 
"Floodproofing." A combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages to properties, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and contents of buildings in a flood hazard area. 
"Floodway." That portion of the stream channel and adjacent floodplain required for the passage or conveyance of a 100-year flood discharge. The floodway boundaries are placed to limit encroachment in the floodplain so that a 100-year flood discharge can be conveyed through the floodplain without materially increasing (less than one foot) the water surface elevation at any point and without producing hazardous velocities or conditions. This is the area of significant depths and velocities and due consideration should be given to effects of fill, loss of cross sectional flow area, and resulting increased water surface elevations. 
"Floodway fringe." That portion of the floodplain lying outside the floodway. This is the area of the floodplain that may be developed or encroached upon as long as the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood is not increased by more than one foot at any point. 
"Floor." The top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including basement), i.e., top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of a garage used solely for parking vehicles. 
"Grading." Any operation or occurrence by which the existing site elevations are changed; or where any ground cover, natural or man-made, is removed; or any watercourse or body of water, either natural or man-made, is relocated on any site, thereby creating an unprotected area. This includes stripping, cutting, filling, stockpiling, or any combination thereof, and shall apply to the land in its cut or filled condition. 
"Greenway." A linear open space established along a natural or constructed corridor (e.g. stream, river or railroad) which is designed to connect recreational areas with cultural or historic features and/or populated areas for pedestrian and/or bicycle traffic. A greenway is developed and maintained to provide protection of natural resources, transportation alternatives, and recreational opportunities. A greenway may include associated amenities (e.g. interpretive markers, canoe launching areas, and trailhead facilities such as buildings, picnic areas and playgrounds) with the linear pathway. 
"Hot spot (priority area)." An area where land use or activities generate highly contaminated runoff, with concentrations of pollutants in excess of those typically found in stormwater. 
"Hydrologic and hydraulic study." Engineering study to determine rates, volumes, and distribution of storm runoff. 
"Human occupancy." Any portion of any enclosed structure wherein humans principally live or sleep such as mobile homes, permanent residential activities, semi-transient residential activities, health care community facilities, nursing home community facilities, orphanages, family care facilities, group care facilities or transient habitation. 
"Impervious surface." A term applied to any ground or structural surface that water cannot penetrate or through which water penetrates with great difficulty. 
"Intent to build." Any plan brought before the City that indicates a man-made change to improve real estate by the addition of buildings or other structures. 
"Land disturbance activity." Any operation or occurrence by which the existing site elevations are changed; or where any ground cover, natural or man-made, is removed; or any watercourse or body of water, either natural or man-made, is relocated on any site, thereby creating an unprotected area. This includes stripping, cutting, filling, stockpiling, or any combination thereof, and shall apply to the land in its cut or filled condition. The phrase land disturbing activity has the same meaning as land disturbance activity. 
"Land disturbance permit." A permit required from the City in certain circumstances of land disturbing activity, as set forth in Code § 27.5-5. 
"Major drainage system." That storm drainage system which carries the runoff from a 100-year frequency storm. Although damage may occur, runoff will be carried by the major system whether or not it has been planned and designed, and whether or not improvements are situated wisely in respect to it. The major system usually includes many features such as streets, gulches, and major drainage channels. Storm sewer systems may reduce the flow in many parts of the major system by storing and transporting water underground. Good planning and designing of a major system should eliminate major damage and loss of life from storms having a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. 
"Managed vegetation." Management that does not involve grubbing, clearing, tilling, disking or plowing of the ground. Cutting, mowing, pruning, no-till planting, and aeration are allowed activities of managed vegetation. 
"Materially increase the degree of flooding." Shall be defined by the following criteria: 
(A)  The proposed development raises the 100-year flood elevation more than one foot; or, when considered in conjunction with other potential developments within the watershed, would contribute disproportionately to increased flooding which when combined with other potential development would cumulatively increase the 100-year flood elevation more than one foot. 
(B)  The proposed development does materially increase the property damage caused by the 100-year flood. 
(C)  The proposed development conflicts with the engineer's determination of factors required for reducing flood damage. 
"Minor drainage system." That storm drainage system which is frequently used for collecting, transporting, and disposing of snow-melt, miscellaneous minor flows, and storm runoff up to the capacity of the system. The capacity should be equal to the maximum rate of runoff to be expected from the initial design storm which has statistical frequency of occurrence of once in ten years, or as specified by the Engineering Department. The minor system is sometimes termed the "convenience system," "initial system," or the "storm sewer system." The minor system may include many features ranging from curbs and gutters to storm sewer pipes and open drainage ways. 
"Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)." The portion of public infrastructure that is not considered "Waters of the State." Usually MS4 refers to wet-weather conveyances while "Waters of the State" usually refer to dry-weather conveyances. This determination is made by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.

Changing the interior of an existing building or other structure without any external change is not considered redevelopment under this chapter. Demolition and reconstruction is considered development and not redevelopment. 
"Retention." The prevention of storm runoff from direct discharge into receiving waters. Examples include systems which discharge through percolation, exfiltration, filtered bleed-down and evaporation processes. 
"Right-of-entry." Authority of City personnel or their designee to enter into properties for the purpose of inspecting private drainage systems.

"Stormwater basin or sub-basin master plan." Any study or plan prepared by or accepted by the City that identifies solutions to water quality or quantity problems on a regional basin or sub-basin area. 
"Stormwater design manuals." Rules or guidelines adopted by the City for handling stormwater in accordance with this chapter. These include the "Stormwater Planning and Low Impact Design Guide" on stormwater runoff source reduction techniques, the "Stormwater Controls Manual" on stormwater quality runoff treatment and such other documents as are identified as a stormwater design manual. These are generally available on the City's webpage. 
"Stormwater management plan." A plan which is defined as including sufficient information to allow the City to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater runoff generated at the site. 
"Stream." Waters of the State except for those waters flowing within wet weather conveyances. In the absence of a definitive assessment by the State of Tennessee of whether a watercourse is a stream or a wet-weather conveyance, the following watercourses are considered to be streams: 
(A)  watercourses serving drainage areas of 100 acres or more, provided that the watercourse existed prior to the development under consideration for application of the water quality protection area; 
(B)  watercourses known to flow regularly after seven days of dry weather (e.g., spring-fed surface water); 
(C)  watercourses identified as a dashed blue line on the USGS map; and 
(D)  watercourses identified as a continuous blue line on the USGS map. 
The City may conclude, subject to review by the State, that a watercourse or segment of watercourse is not a stream, based on a review of field data assessing its geomorphology, hydrology and biology.

"Waters of the State." Any watercourse determined to be in the jurisdiction of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC). Waters of the State are separate and distinct from an MS4 and private infrastructure. Waters of the State or simply waters means any and all water, public or private, on or beneath the surface of the ground, which are contained within, flow through or border upon Tennessee or any portion thereof except those bodies of water confined to and retained within the limits of private property in single ownership which do not combine to effect a junction with natural surface or underground waters. 
"Water Quality Protection Area (WQPA)."

"Water quality volume (WQv)." The storage needed to capture and treat 90% of the average annual stormwater runoff volume. In the unit of acre-feet, WQv = (P)(Rv)(A/12), where P is the 90th percentile Murfreesboro rain event in inches (1.2 inches), Rv is a coefficient that depends on the amount of impervious surface on a property and A is the area in acres. 
"Wetland." Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency or duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typical to life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include, but are not limited to, swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
"Wet weather conveyances." Man-made or natural watercourses, including natural watercourses that have been modified by channelization, that flow only in direct response to precipitation runoff in their immediate locality and whose channels are above the groundwater table and which do not support fish and aquatic life and are not suitable for drinking water supplies.

(A)  General. Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this chapter, unless a written request to waive this requirement is filed and granted. 
(B)  Conditions for waiver. The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies: 
(1)  It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter and compliance with the requirements may create a risk to public safety or to private property (eg. risk of flooding by adding on site detention to redevelopment project). Risk or a significant hardship (other than cost of compliance) is a prerequisite for a waiver. The standards for granting a waiver may be less restrictive, and the extent of the waiver may be greater, for redevelopment than development. 
(2)  Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. The off-site facility must be in place and designed to provide the level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices. Further, the facility must be operated and maintained by an entity that is legally obligated to continue the operation and maintenance of the facility. 
(C)  Downstream damage, etc., prohibited. In order to receive a waiver, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the waiver will not lead to any of the following conditions downstream: 
(1)  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
(2)  Degradation of biological functions or habitat; 
(3)  Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation; or 
(4)  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life or property. 
(D)  A land disturbance permit not to be issued where waiver requested. No land disturbance permit shall be issued where a waiver has been requested until the waiver is granted. If no waiver is granted, the plans must be resubmitted with the required plans. 
(E)  Grant of waiver. If the waiver request is recommended by City staff, a simple majority vote of the Board in favor of granting the waiver shall be sufficient. If the waiver request is not recommended in whole or in part by City staff, a two-thirds vote of the Board shall be required to grant the waiver to which staff objection is made. 
(Ord. No. 88-60 § 6, 12-15-88; Ord. No. 04-O-69 § 6, 12-09-04; Ord. No. 06-O-27 § 1, 03-08-07; Ord. No. 08-O-17 §§ 10-12, 06-05-08)

(A)  Minimum control requirements. 
(1)  BMP manual. The City adopts as its Best Management Practices (BMP) manual for erosion and sediment control the TDEC Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control Handbook, as amended, which is incorporated by reference in this chapter as if fully set out herein. This manual includes a list of acceptable BMP's including specific design performance criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. The erosion and sediment control manual may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the City Council, upon the recommendation of the Director of MWSD, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and local maintenance experience. Stormwater facilities that are designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with these BMP criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards. 
(2)  Stormwater design manuals. The City adopts as its BMP manual its own stormwater design manuals for permanent stormwater management. These manuals include the "Stormwater Planning and Low Impact Design Guide" for stormwater runoff source reduction techniques and the "Stormwater Controls Manual" for stormwater quality runoff treatments. These may be updated and expanded from time to time. The City Council must approve any change to a stormwater design manual which imposes a new general requirement or which allows a new credit to the stormwater utility fee. Changes shall be based upon the recommendation of the Director of MWSD, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and local maintenance experience. City Council approval of proprietary systems shall not be required. Stormwater facilities that are designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with a stormwater design manual will be presumed to meet minimum performance standards. 
(B)  General performance criteria for stormwater management. Unless granted a waiver under Section 27.5-6 or determined by the City to be exempt, the following minimum performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites: 
(1)  All site designs shall control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge to reduce the generation of post construction stormwater runoff to pre-construction levels as specified in subsection (G). These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. 
(2)  To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as specified in subsection (G). 
(3)  Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (e.g., recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices. 
(4)  Stormwater discharges from hot spots may require the application of specific structural BMP's and pollution prevention practices. 
(5)  Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land disturbance permits should consult with the MWSD to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements. 
(6)  The calculations for determining peak flows as found in a stormwater design manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater facilities. 
(7)  The requirements as defined in BMP manual and stormwater design manuals as approved and adopted by the City.

The soils report shall be based on on-site boring logs or soil pit profiles and soil survey reports. The number and location of required soil borings or soil pits shall be determined based on what is needed to determine the suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the control measure. 
(4)  Maintenance and repair plan. The design and planning of all stormwater management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair procedures to ensure their continued performance. These plans will identify the parts or components of a stormwater management facility that need to be maintained and the equipment and skills or training necessary. Provisions for the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance program and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall be included in the plan. The plan may, at City's option, require the owner to file periodic inspection reports or certifications that the required maintenance and repairs have been performed and that the facility is functioning as initially designed and installed. A location map of all stormwater management BMP's with a permanent elevation benchmark shall be submitted to assist in the periodic inspection of the facility. 
(5)  Maintenance easements. The applicant must ensure access to the site for the purpose of inspection and repair by securing all the maintenance easements needed. These easements must be binding on the current property owner and all subsequent owners of the property and must be properly recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds. 
(6)  Maintenance Agreement. 
(a)  The maintenance responsibilities for permanent stormwater runoff control facilities shall be determined based upon the type of ownership of the property which is controlled by the facilities. 
(b)  Where the permanent stormwater runoff control facilities are designed to manage runoff from property in a single entity ownership as defined below, the maintenance responsibility for the stormwater control facilities shall be with the single entity owner. 
(c)  The stated responsibilities of the entity in terms of owning and maintaining the facilities shall be submitted with the stormwater management plan for determination of their adequacy. Approval of the stormwater management plan shall be conditioned upon the approval of these terms. These terms shall be in writing, shall be in recordable form, and shall, in addition to any other terms deemed necessary by the City, and shall contain a provision permitting inspection at any reasonable time by the City.

(E)  Erosion prevention and sediment control plan requirements. The erosion prevention and sediment control plan shall accurately describe the potential for soil erosion and sedimentation problems resulting from land disturbing activity and shall explain and illustrate the measures that are to be taken to control these problems. The length and complexity of the plan is to be commensurate with the size of the project, severity of the site condition, and potential for off-site damage. The plan shall be certified by a registered professional engineer licensed in the State of Tennessee, a Certified Professional in Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC), or person who has satisfactorily completed the TDEC/UT - sponsored Level I (Fundamentals) and Level II (Design) Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control classes. The plan shall also conform to the requirements found in the BMP manual, and shall include at least the following: 
(1)  A brief description of the intended project and proposed land disturbing activity including number of units and structures to be constructed and infrastructure required. 
(2)  A topographic map with contour intervals of two feet or less showing present conditions and proposed contours resulting from land disturbing activity. 
(3)  All existing drainage ways, including intermittent and wet-weather, including any designated floodways or floodplains. 
(4)  A general description of existing land cover. Individual trees and shrubs do not need to be identified. 
(5)  Stands of existing trees as they are to be preserved upon project completion, specifying their general location on the property. Differentiation shall be made between existing trees to be preserved, trees to be removed and proposed planted trees. Tree protection measures must be identified, and the diameter of the area involved must also be identified on the plan and shown to scale. Information shall be supplied concerning the proposed destruction of exceptional and historic trees in setbacks and buffer strips, where they exist. 
(6)  Approximate limits of proposed clearing, land disturbance and filling. 
(7)  Approximate flows of existing stormwater leaving any portion of the site. 
(8)  A general description of existing soil types and characteristics and any anticipated soil erosion and sedimentation problems resulting from existing characteristics. 
(9)  Location, size and layout of proposed stormwater and sedimentation control improvements. 
(10)  Proposed drainage network. 
(11)  Proposed drain tile or waterway sizes. 
(12)  Approximate flows leaving site after construction and incorporating water run-off mitigation measures. The evaluation must include projected effects on property adjoining the site and on existing drainage facilities and systems.

(13)  The projected sequence of work represented by the grading, drainage and erosion prevention and sediment control plans as related to other major items of construction, beginning with the initiation of excavation and including the construction of any sediment basins or retention facilities or any other structural BMP's. 
(14)  Specific remediation measures to prevent erosion and sedimentation run-off. Plans shall include detailed drawings of all control measures used; stabilization measures including vegetation and non-vegetation measures, both temporary and permanent, will be detailed. Detailed construction notes and a maintenance schedule shall be included for all control measures in the plan. 
(15)  Specific details for the construction of rock pads, wash down pads, and settling basins for controlling erosion and sediment loss; road access points; eliminating or keeping soil, sediment, and debris on streets and public ways at a level acceptable to the City. 
(16)  Soil, sediment, and debris brought onto streets and public ways must be removed by the end of the work day by machine, broom or shovel to the satisfaction of the City. Failure to remove the soil, sediment, or debris shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. Any material creating hazardous roadway conditions shall require immediate clean-up. 
(17)  Proposed structures; location (to the extent possible) and identification of any proposed additional buildings, structures or development on the site. 
(18)  A description of any on-site measures to be taken to recharge surface water into the ground water system through infiltration. 
(19)  Erosion prevention and sediment control measures shall be designed to control the rainfall and runoff from a two-year, 24-hour storm, as a minimum. 
(20)  For common drainage locations that serve an area with ten or more acres disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment basin that provides storage for a calculated volume of runoff from a two-year, 24-hour storm and runoff coefficient from each disturbed acre drained, or equivalent control measures, shall be provided until final stabilization of the site. Where no such calculation has been performed, a temporary (or permanent) sediment basin providing 3,600 cubic feet of storage per acre drained, or equivalent control measures, shall be provided until final stabilization of the site. 
(21)  Management practices and controls to prevent waste, including discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, asphaltic concrete mix, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste, from entering the stormwater drainage system and Waters of the State. 
(F)  Post-construction runoff quality requirement. The stormwater management plan and controls for all development or redevelopment projects involving one acre or more of land and the construction of 10,000 square feet or more of impervious surface within a two-year period must be designed to remove at least 80% of the average annual load of total suspended solids (TSS) in post-construction runoff. The 80% TSS reduction applies to the first 1.2 inches of rainfall. One or more structural controls, as described in the City's stormwater design manuals, may be required to achieve the required result. If this requirement applies to a redevelopment project, it is the area of redevelopment rather than the entire site which must be made compliant. 
(1)  The stormwater management plan and controls for residential subdivisions may utilize a design alternative to this performance standard. Under this design alternative, a dry extended detention area (pond) may be combined with grass lined channels in a treatment train to achieve a satisfactory post-construction runoff quality treatment level. The length of grass channel required per acre under this design option shall be sized based on the distance from the stormwater discharge outlet to the extended detention pond and on the slope (greater or less than 2%) and the degree of imperviousness (less than 33% or less than 66%) of the grass lined channel as shown below, provided the bottom of the grass lined channel is a minimum of 2 ft. wide: 
Grass Channel Per Acre Sizing Criteria Parameter < = 33% Imperviousness Between 34% & 66%
Imperviousness Slope (max 4%) < 2% = or > 2% < 2% > 2% Grass channel minimum length (ft.) 25 40 30 45  
(G)  Stream bank protection requirement. Stormwater management plan and controls must be designed to prevent erosion of channels and stream banks by controlling peak discharge rates. The stream bank protection volume standard (SPv) must be calculated for each site. Redevelopment compliance shall be based on the area of the site being redeveloped. 
(1)  Stormwater discharge must be controlled on site so that runoff from a one-year, 24-hour storm event (3.11 in.) will be discharged from the site over a 24-hour or greater period of time. 
(2)  Peak discharge rates post-construction may not exceed the pre-construction peak discharge rates for two year or ten-year storm events. 
(3)  If the site has less than two acres (87,120 square feet) of impervious area, the City will consider on site low impact design features included in a City stormwater design manual as an alternative method of achieving stream bank protection. 
(4)  If a hydrologic analysis from an engineer can prove to the satisfaction of the City that neither the post construction runoff from a development site of a one year 24-hour storm event nor the peak discharge from a two-year or ten-year storm event will impact channel integrity, the City may waive some or all of these area stream bank protection requirements.

Section 27.5-8 - Review of building permit applications and development plans. 
(A)  No construction, regardless of size, whether by private or public action, shall be performed in such a manner as to materially increase the degree of flooding in its vicinity or in other areas whether by flow restrictions, increased runoff or by diminishing retention capacity. 
(B)  The City Engineer shall have the authority to review permit applications filed with the Building Department to determine whether development of a site is likely to have a significant hydrologic impact or materially increase the degree of flooding, and may in such case require stormwater plans. For the purpose of this section, developments that may have a significant hydrologic impact shall include the grading, excavation, clearance or other alteration of the landscape for other than agricultural purposes whether or not a building application has been filed, and whether or not subdivision of the land or construction on the land is contemplated in the near future. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-69 § 8, 12-09-04; Ord. No. 06-O-27 § 1, 03-08-07) 
Section 27.5-9 - Floodplain requirements. 
(A)  Floodplain regulations. Uses permitted within the floodplain shall be in accordance with Section 23 of Appendix A-Zoning. The regulations and controls set forth in this section shall be applied within the areas designated on the zoning map or on special overlays thereto which are made a part of this chapter and may be viewed upon request at the Planning Department. However, nothing contained herein shall prohibit the application of the regulations of Section 23 of Appendix A-Zoning to lands which can be demonstrated by competent engineering survey, prepared by a registered Tennessee engineer, using the adopted profiles from which the flood protection elevation is derived, to lie within any floodplain, and conversely, any lands which can be demonstrated by competent engineering survey prepared by a registered Tennessee engineer to lie beyond the floodplain shall not be subject to regulations contained in Section 23 of Appendix A-Zoning. Any lands within the areas designated as floodplains on the zoning map or special overlays thereto shall be subject to the regulations and controls pertaining to floodplains as set forth in this chapter. 
(B)  Alterations of floodplain land and drainage channels. No alterations of floodplain land and drainage channels may be made without the written approval of the City Engineer. All applicable requirements of this chapter and, in addition, the following conditions must be met before such approval may be granted: 
(1)  The construction of a detention or retention basin, levee, earth fill, building or other structure which alters a floodplain area shall only be permitted based on a plan prepared by a registered Tennessee engineer, showing existing and proposed elevations, existing and proposed drainage channels, and existing and proposed structures, and the plan shall be approved by the City Engineer certifying that the alteration and construction as proposed would not materially increase the degree of flooding in other areas, and that any structures proposed to be constructed in the floodplain shall meet the following special conditions: 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other municipal ordinance or regulation to the contrary, the minimum floor elevation of the lowest floor of any structure intended for human occupancy shall be either equal to the flood protection elevation or floodproofed to one foot above the base flood elevation. All other related facilities thereto such as electrical equipment, water service and sanitary sewer connections shall be either equal to or higher than the base flood elevation or shall be floodproofed to the flood protection elevation; and, 
(b)  The minimum floor elevation of any structure not intended for human occupancy, as defined, shall be either equal to or higher than the flood protection elevation. floodproofing of structures will only be authorized by the City Engineer as specific individual exceptions to minimum floor elevation requirements where it can be shown that the proposed floodproofing is an acceptable engineering alternative. 
(2)  The proposed excavation, filling or change of alignment of any existing channel under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Corps of Engineers shall be approved by the Corps of Engineers. 
(3)  The plan is approved by the Planning Commission taking into account the above conditions as well as any other pertinent factors. Any duly approved alteration of the floodplain will be so noted on the official zoning map as a matter of information. 
(4)  Any non-permitted drainage system or construction or fill located within a floodplain, shall upon written notice from the City Engineer, be removed at the property owner's expense. 
(C)  Floodproofing measures. Floodproofing measures such as the following shall be designed consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area, and flood velocities, forces and other factors associated with the flood protection elevation. The City Engineer shall require that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered Tennessee engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area: 
(1)  Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement; 
(2)  Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters; 
(3)  Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures; 
(4)  Use of paints, membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of water through walls; 
(5)  Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation; 
(6)  Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures; 
(7)  Construction of water supply and waste treatment systems to prevent the entrance of floodwaters; 
(8)  Pumping facilities for subsurface drainage systems for buildings to relieve external foundation wall and basement floor pressures; 
(9)  Construction to resist rupture or collapse, caused by water pressure or flotation debris; and, 
(10)  Cutoff valves on sewer lines or the elimination of gravity flow basement drains. 
(D)  Development within floodways. No development will be allowed within floodways that would impair their capability to carry and discharge a 100-year flood except where it can be shown by a registered Tennessee engineer that the effect on flood heights is fully offset by stream improvements. 
(E)  Degree of flood protection. The degree of flood protection intended to be provided by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes, and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on occasions, or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside floodplain boundaries or land uses permitted within such district will always be totally free from flooding or flood damages. Nor shall this chapter create a liability on the part of, or a cause of action against the City or any officer or employee thereof from any flood damages that may result from implementation of this chapter. 
(F)  Application of Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Approval by the City does not relieve the developer of obtaining any permits required by Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.

No temporary certificate of occupancy for any structure in a development or redevelopment shall be issued unless work required for completion has been determined, a schedule established and a performance security provided. 
(B)  Final inspections and release of bonds for public stormwater facilities. A final inspection by the City will be required before any performance security will be released on a stormwater facility which is or is to become publicly owned or maintained. The City may, but is not required to, provide for partial, pro-rata releases of the performance security based on completion of various stages of development. 
(C)  Stabilization requirements. 
(1)  Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared by development activities shall be revegetated according to a schedule approved by the City. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts: 
(a)  Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over 75% of the seeded area. 
(b)  Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. 
(c)  Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of 75% of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum 75% survival for one year is achieved. 
(d)  Final stabilization shall be accomplished with permanent cover. 
(e)  Developers shall be required to give a warranty for stabilization vegetation as part of their development agreement and to provide a performance security. 
(D)  Inspection of stormwater management facilities. Periodic inspections of facilities shall be performed as required by the City. 
(E)  Failure to meet or maintain maintenance or performance standards. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet maintenance or performance standards required under this chapter, the City, after reasonable written notice, may correct violations of the standards by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes an immediate danger to public safety or public health, the notice may be oral or omitted.

ARTICLE II. - WATER QUALITY PROTECTION AREA 

Section 27.5-17 - Water Quality Protection Area. 
A water quality protection area (WQPA) is a strip of undisturbed vegetation, either original or reestablished, bordering streams, ponds, wetlands, reservoirs or lakes, which provides: 
(A)  A naturally vegetated and pervious buffer between a stream and clearing, grading, filling, paving and building activities of nearby new site development; and 
(B)  Protection of stream quality, and resource management benefits. 
(Ord. No. 06-O-27 §§ 4, 5, 03-08-07) 
Section 27.5-18 - Development and redevelopment. 
In all development and redevelopment adjacent to streams and wetlands, the persons involved in the process of development shall provide for and ensure the establishment, protection, maintenance and function of the WQPA. In development and significant redevelopment, the WQPA requirements apply to the whole site. In redevelopment, the WQPA applies only to the specific area of redevelopment. 
(Ord. No. 06-O-27 §§ 4, 5, 03-08-07) 
Section 27.5-19 - Zones and vegetation. 
Zone widths and target vegetation within the WQPA are as follows: 
(A)  Zone 1 is measured perpendicular to the stream channel. Zone 2 is measured along the same line beginning at the outside edge of Zone 1. 
(B)  Where a stream is indicated as a continuous blue line or double blue line on the USGS map, Zone 1 shall measure 35 feet from top of bank, and Zone 2, 15 feet. 
(C)  Where a stream is indicated as a dashed blue line on the USGS map, Zone 1 shall measure 35 feet from top of bank, and Zone 2, 15 feet. 
(D)  Where a stream is not indicated on the USGS map, Zone 1 shall measure 20 feet from top of bank, and Zone 2, 15 feet. 
(E)  The vegetative target in Zone 1 is a variety of mature vegetation, including trees, allowed to grow undisturbed. Native vegetation is preferred. Native vegetation is required for any new plantings, and invasive species are prohibited. 
(F)  While the preferred vegetation for Zone 2 is a variety of plants, including grasses, allowed to grow undisturbed, other forms of vegetation are allowed in Zone 2. Managed vegetation is allowed in Zone 2, subject to limitations in Section 27.5-20. Native vegetation is required for any new plantings, except non-native lawn grasses are allowed. 
(G)  To summarize (A) through (F): 
Zone 1 Zone 2 WQPA width measurement Stream represented by continuous blue line 35 feet from top of bank 15 feet Stream represented by dashed blue line 35 feet from top of bank 15 feet Stream not shown on USGS map 20 feet from top of bank 15 feet Vegetative target, in areas with pre-existing trees alongside stream: Undisturbed, mature vegetation; native vegetation preferred; new plantings must be native vegetation Undisturbed vegetation; native vegetation, including grasses preferred; other vegetation and managed vegetation is allowed; new plantings must be native vegetation  
(H)  When wetland areas extend beyond the edge of the required WQPA width, the WQPA shall be adjusted so that the area consists of the extent of the wetland plus a 35-foot zone extending beyond the wetland edge. The target vegetation in this zone shall be undisturbed, native vegetation. 
(I)  Ponds which intersect the stream channel shall have the same WQPA as the original stream measured from the top of the bank of the pond. WQPA requirements shall not apply to a detention or retention pond constructed as a water quality management practice. 
(J)  In areas of the WQPA without pre-existing tree canopy alongside the stream, the property developer must enhance the WQPA by planting trees, as follows: 
(1)  Pre-existing tree canopy means a corridor of trees rooted within 15 feet of the stream's top of bank providing canopy and shade along the stream; 
(2)  Where a property has no pre-existing canopy or the existing canopy is broken by a 40-foot or greater section or sections, with only low-growing vegetation (18 inches or less), as traced out by the drip lines of adjacent trees, the developer must plant trees in these sections. 
(3)  Planting standards and specifications. 
(a)  A variety of native tree seedlings/saplings planted within 15 feet of the top of stream bank evenly spaced on approximately ten-foot centers. More than one species shall be planted and every effort should be made to observe the surrounding area and identify which native tree species dominate that particular locale so as to aid in the seedling/sapling selection process. 
(b)  A plan shall be submitted to the City for approval, before there is any disturbance of the WQPA. The plan must address erosion prevention and sediment control. The plan is subject to approval by the City Horticulturalist. 
(c)  Planting must be done at a time to minimize stress to plants. All planting must be completed by the next planting season. Performance sureties shall not be released or final certificates of occupancy granted until the planting is accomplished. 
(4)  Planting standards and specifications for commercial properties. Plantings which fulfill the requirements for perimeter and buffer zone landscaping, of Appendix A-Zoning, Section 27, may be allowed to serve as required WQPA plantings, where the plantings are adjacent the stream and will function to establish canopy alongside the stream.

Revenue sources for the stormwater utility's activities may include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(A)  Stormwater user fees. 
(B)  Civil penalties and damage assessments imposed for or arising from the violation of the City's stormwater management ordinances. 
(C)  Stormwater permit and inspection fees. 
(D)  Other funds or income obtained from federal, state, local, and private grants, or revolving funds, and from the Local Government Public Obligations Act of 1986 (Tennessee Code Annotated, title 9, chapter 21). 
To the extent that the stormwater user fees collected are insufficient to construct needed stormwater drainage facilities, the cost of the same may be advanced from such City funds as may be determined by the City Council. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-38 - Stormwater utility management fund. 
All revenues generated by the stormwater user fees shall be deposited in a stormwater utility management fund and used exclusively for stormwater management. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-39 - Operating budget. 
The City Council shall adopt, based on a recommendation from the Water and Sewer Board, an operating budget for the stormwater utility management fund each fiscal year. The operating budget shall set forth for such fiscal year the estimated revenues and the estimated costs for operations and maintenance, extension and replacement and debt service. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-40 - Stormwater user fees established. 
There shall be imposed on each and every property in the City, except exempt property, a stormwater user fee. Prior to establishing or amending the stormwater user fees, the City shall advertise its intent to do so by publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least 30 days in advance of the meeting of the City Council which shall consider the adoption of the fee or its amendment. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-41 - Single family residential unit (SFU). 
(A)  Establishment. There is established for purposes of calculating the stormwater user fees the single family residential unit (SFU) as a method of measurement. 
(B)  Definition. The SFU is the median of the total square footage of the impervious surface areas of developed single family residential lots within the City as set by the City Council. 
(C)  Setting the SFU. The SFU shall be set by Council from time to time by resolution. 
(D)  Source of SFU. Council shall have the discretion to determine the source of the data from which the SFU is established, taking into consideration the general acceptance and use of such source on the part of other stormwater systems, and the reliability and general accuracy of the source including but not limited to property tax assessor's rolls, site examination, mapping information, aerial photographs, and other reliable information. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-42 - Property classification for stormwater user fee. 
(A)  Property classifications. For purposes of determining the stormwater user fee, all properties in the City are classified into one of the following classes: 
(1)  Single family residential property; 
(2)  Non-single family property; 
(3)  Exempt property. 
(B)  Single family residential fee. The City Council finds that the intensity of development of most parcels of real property in the City classified as single family residential is similar and that it would be excessively and unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the impervious surface on each such parcel. Therefore, all single family residential properties in the City shall be charged a uniform stormwater management fee, equal to the base rate, regardless of the size of the parcel or the impervious surface area of the improvements. 
(C)  Non-single family property fee. The fee for non-single family property shall be the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area (square feet) of the property by one SFU. The impervious surface area for non-single family property is the square footage for the impervious surface area on the property. The minimum stormwater user fee for non-single family property shall be one SFU. 
(D)  Exempt property. There shall be no stormwater user fee for exempt property. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-43 - Base rate. 
The City Council shall, by resolution, establish the base rate for the SFU. The base rate shall be calculated to insure adequate revenues to fund the costs of stormwater management and to provide for the operation, maintenance, and capital improvements of the stormwater utility system in the City. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-44 - Adjustments to stormwater user fees. 
The stormwater utility shall adjust the stormwater user fee for non-single family property based on its Credit and Appeals Policy. This policy shall provide credits to stormwater user fees charged owners of non-single family property who implement onsite stormwater management controls that provide peak runoff and/or volume control, stormwater quality best management practices and proper operation and maintenance of the onsite stormwater facilities. This policy, to be approved by resolution of the City Council, shall provide for: flood control volume credits; stormwater quality volume credits; streambank protection volume credits; education credits; and NPDES stormwater permitted facilities credits. This policy shall also provide for adjustments to the stormwater user fee if it can be proven that the City has incorrectly calculated the total impervious area of the non-single family property. This policy shall specify how owners are to apply for credits and adjustments. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-45 - Property owners to pay charges. 
The owner of each non-exempt property shall be obligated to pay the stormwater user fees as provided in this article, provided however, that if no water or sewer service is being provided at the property to the owner as a customer of record and such service is being provided to a customer of record other than the owner, it shall be presumed that the owner and such customer of record have agreed that the customer of record shall be obligated to pay such stormwater user fee. If the customer of record rebuts this presumption as provided for in the Credit and Appeals Policy, the owner shall pay such charges. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-46 - Billing procedures and penalties for late payment. 
(A)  Rate and collection schedule. The stormwater user fee shall be set at a rate, collected at a location, on a schedule, established by resolution, which resolution shall also specify when the fee shall become delinquent and the late fee which shall become due on delinquent payments. 
(B)  Penalties for late payment. Stormwater user fees shall be subject to a late fee established by resolution. The City shall be entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in collecting delinquent stormwater user fees. 
(C)  Mandatory statement. To the extent that state law, T.C.A. § 68-221-1112, requires it, each bill that shall contain stormwater user fees shall also contain the following statement in bold: "THIS TAX HAS BEEN MANDATED BY CONGRESS". It is the position of City that the stormwater user fee is not a tax but a utility service charge. 
(Ord. No. 07-O-25 § 1, 07-19-07) 
Section 27.5-47 - Appeals of fees. 
Any person who disagrees with the calculation of the stormwater user fee, as provided in this article, or who seeks a stormwater user fee adjustment based upon stormwater management practices, may appeal such fee determination to the stormwater utility within 30 days from the date of the last bill containing stormwater user fees charges. Any appeal must be filed, and will be decided, in accordance with the Credit and Appeal Policy.

(B)  Since construction of an entrance ramp contiguous to a rollover curb (sometimes called a sloped face curb) does not require a curb cut, subsection (A) has no application to same. However, in all instances where the curb is to be disturbed, an excavation permit is required, no matter that type of curb. 
(C)  Notwithstanding subsection (A) above, ground preparation, seeding and sodding in a storm drainage easement shall not require an excavation permit. However, any other excavation or filling in a storm drainage easement shall require an excavation permit.

Surety bonds and letters of credit shall be submitted to the City pursuant to subsection (H) herein. The limit of the surety agreement shall be determined by the Engineering Department and the minimum running bond shall be $50,000.00. The required surety bond or letter of credit must be issued by an insurance company or bank licensed and authorized to transact business in the State of Tennessee and shall be conditioned upon the permittee's compliance with this ordinance and the right(s)-of-way excavation agreement, and shall secure and hold the City and its officers harmless against any and all claims, judgments, or other costs arising from the excavation and other work covered by the right(s)-of-way excavation permit by reason of any accident or injury to persons or property, trespass, or inverse condemnation through the fault of the permittee, or subcontractor(s), and further conditioned to require permittee to refill, restore and replace in good and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition and conformity with approved plans, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer; to restore all openings and excavations made in City right(s)-of-way, and to maintain the City right(s)-of-way where excavation is made in good condition for the period of 12 months after said work shall have been approved in writing by the City, ordinary wear and tear excepted. The 12-month period for maintenance will renew and start over with any repair of any portion of the excavation site. Any settlement of the surface within the one-year period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective back-filling by the permittee. The City may rely upon the information furnished by the permittee and it shall be no defense to a claim by the City against permittee or surety that the City made an error in issuing the right(s)-of-way excavation permit. 
(B)  (1)  Any owner of real estate repairing or engaging another to repair the owner's sidewalk or driveway shall not be required to give such bond or letter of credit. 
(2)  The developer of a subdivision who has posted a street bond for a subdivision requiring a right(s)-of-way excavation permit, shall not be required to post an additional bond in conjunction with the issuance of the right(s)-of-way excavation permit. 
(3)  In the event the applicant for a right(s)-of-way excavation permit is requesting a street cut in a highway maintained by the State of Tennessee and the applicant has posted a bond with the Tennessee Department of Transportation for the street cut, the applicant will not be required to post an additional bond or letter of credit in favor of the City when obtaining a right(s)-of-way excavation permit. 
(C)  Recovery on a right(s)-of-way bond, letter of credit, or surety agreement for any claim shall not extinguish same, but it shall in its entirety be available for all subsequent claims during the excavation for which it was given, plus maintenance of the excavation for which it was given, plus maintenance of the excavation site as required by this chapter and the right(s)-of-way excavation agreement. In the event of any suit or claim against the City by reason of the negligence or default of the permittee, upon the City giving written notice to permittee and surety of such suit or claim, the permittee and surety shall hold the City harmless and indemnify the City for all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs. 
(D)  Any annual bond, letter of credit, or surety agreement given under this provision shall remain in force for one year plus the one year maintenance period, conditioned as above, in the amount specified in subsection (H) herein, which is based on the permittee's anticipated work for one year and shall be applicable to all excavation in any City right(s)-of-way. Should the permittee exceed the estimate of utility cuts during the year, the permittee shall increase the bond or letter of credit to the appropriate amount based on subsection (H) herein. 
(E)  In lieu of a corporate surety bond, letter of credit, or surety agreement required above, the application may be accompanied with a cash deposit or certificate of deposit, made to the City for deposit with or holding by the City Recorder. The amount shall be determined by the City Engineer. Any municipal corporation, public utility, or government agency intending or required to make multiple openings, cuts or excavation in City right(s)-of-way, such as the telephone company, electric power distributor, and natural gas distributor may make and maintain with the City Treasurer a general deposit in an amount to be determined by the City Engineer. 
(F)  Any special or general deposit made hereunder shall serve as security for the repair and performance of work necessary to put the City right(s)-of-way in as good a condition as it was prior to the excavation and in conformity with approved plans. If the permittee fails to make the necessary repairs or complete excavation within the time specified in the permit, the City may proceed to complete same and charge the expense to the permittee and surety as provided in subsection (G) below. Upon the permittee's satisfactory completion of the work covered by such permit as determined by the City Engineer, two-thirds of any remaining deposit, except in the case of any annual deposit, shall be refunded (without interest) to the permittee and any remaining balance shall be refunded to the permittee upon the expiration of the maintenance period less all deductions. The balance of any annual deposit shall be refunded at the expiration of the maintenance period. No interest shall be paid on cash deposits. 
(G)  The City may use any or all of any deposit, letter of credit, or bond to pay the cost of any work the City performs to restore or maintain the City right(s)-of-way in the event the permittee fails to perform such work as provided in the right(s)-of-way excavation agreement or this chapter. If the permittee exposes the public to danger and fails to promptly correct same after notice (should the permittee not be readily available, the notice requirement is waived), the City may take steps deemed necessary in the sole discretion of the City to correct a dangerous situation which is a threat to public safety and charge same to permittee and surety. Once an excavation is started, it must be completed expeditiously. In the event an excavation is not pursued expeditiously after started, or is not completed within the time specified in the permit or any extension, or is abandoned, or the area is not properly restored or maintained, the City may give the permittee seven days notice of the deficiency. If corrective action is not initiated within said seven days or any extension thereof granted by the City Engineer, the City may perform the necessary work and charge same to permittee and surety. Prior notice to the surety is waived. Any permittee or surety aggrieved by any action of the City under this article is entitled to a due process hearing before the City Manager upon written notice filed with the City Recorder within ten days of the event giving rise to the complaint. When the City uses its own employees to repair a street, shoulder, sidewalk, storm drainage ditch, or public utility that should have been repaired by a permit holder, the permit holder must reimburse the City at the rate of 150% of actual costs of the City. "Actual costs" are defined as employees' actual wages and benefits, with benefits calculated at 30% of wages; rental value of equipment, signs and barricades in accordance with a uniform schedule; cost of all materials; and, any outside costs. 
(H)  The utility cut performance bonds shall be based upon an estimate of $100.00 per square yard to correct improper utility cuts. The permittee shall estimate the area of the excavation. The bond will be based on a reasonable estimate as determined by the City Engineer. Records will be monitored and should permittee exceed the estimated yardage of repairs, the permittee shall increase the bond to the appropriate amount.

The permittee shall, at the permittee's expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property which may be damaged during the process of the excavation and shall be responsible for all damage to all public and private property resulting from the permittee's failure to properly protect and carry out said work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area or storm drainage ditch, these areas shall be properly reseeded and strawed immediately following backfilling of the trench, unless otherwise directed by the City Engineer. In certain situations the city engineer may direct the permittee to sod these areas instead of seeding and strawing. All construction and maintenance work shall be performed in a manner calculated to leave the lawn, storm drainage ditch, and other areas clean of earth and debris, and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before such work began. All backfill material shall be 100% compacted crushed stone, except for areas outside the limits of the roadway which shall require compacted backfill.

The material shall not be stored in a drainage way. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to permit storing excavated material beside the trench, the City Engineer shall have the authority to require the permittee to haul the excavated material to a storage site. In certain situations the City may allow the permittee to permanently dispose of the excess excavated material on property owned by the City. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements for all storage and disposal sites.

Section 29-1 - Purpose. 
The subdivision of land and the extensions and improvements to streets and utilities are important to the public interest in that the maintenance of public services becomes a public responsibility and the correction of defects is costly and difficult. It is therefore to the interest of the public, the developer, and the future owners that improvements be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards. In support of this purpose, the Planning Commission shall adopt and from time to time amend regulations concerning the process for the development and construction of subdivisions within the City, including specifications for the construction of streets, sidewalks and other public infrastructure. When the word "streets" is used in this section it shall have the same meaning as when it is used in the Subdivision Regulations and Street Design Specifications, as amended. Such regulations and specifications shall have the full force and effect authorized by state law and the City Charter.

(2)  The City shall not accept the dedication of streets and related public infrastructure (including but not limited to water, repurified water, sanitary sewer and storm water facilities) until all requirements of the Subdivision Regulations and Street Design Specifications, the Murfreesboro Water and Sewer Department Policies, Procedures and General Design Requirements, and any specific requirements of any Development Agreement, have been satisfied, including all required testing and inspections. From and after the effective date of this ordinance, written notice of acceptance of construction sent to the developer by the City shall be the only method by which the City accepts dedication; the City will not accept dedication by implication through public use. 
(3)  Liability for claims of personal injury or property damages arising from claims of improper construction or maintenance of streets and related public infrastructure shall be that of the developer rather than the City until the dedication of such streets and related public infrastructure to the City has been accepted by the City sending written notice of acceptance of construction to the developer. 
(B)  Ownership. 
(1)  Streets and related public infrastructure (including but not limited to water, repurified water, sanitary sewer and stormwater facilities) lying within the boundaries of any recorded plat of any subdivision, or lying partly within the boundaries of any such street and partly within the boundaries of any lot or lots in such subdivision, shall be and become the property of the City if and when the City sends written notice of acceptance of construction to the developer and thereby accepts the developer's public dedication of such streets and related public infrastructure. 
(2)  It shall be a condition for the approval of any plat of any subdivision by the Planning Commission, and for the contributions made by the City to the laying of water mains and sanitary sewer lines and towards the surfacing of streets, as herein provided for, that the developer shall consent to the ownership of such facilities being vested in the City as herein provided. Whenever a developer has submitted a plat of a proposed subdivision to the Planning Commission for approval, or whenever such developer shall apply for approval of such plat, it shall be conclusively presumed that such developer irrevocably consented that such ownership shall be vested in the City in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(C)  Notwithstanding subsection (B) above, when the proposed subdivision or subdivision lot is in the Consolidated Utility District (CUD) water service area, then the water lines shall become the property of CUD only when accepted by CUD. However, no proposed subdivision or subdivision lot may be approved in the CUD water service area unless it meets all the City requirements for fire protection, including but not limited to the size of the water line, water pressure and installation of fire hydrants. The Planning Commission Secretary may not sign and approve the final plat until the fire protection requirements of the City have been satisfied or can be satisfied and appropriate surety has been provided to assure same.

(A)  Water mains, including service lines to serve each lot within the subdivision (which shall be capped off until service through same may be required), shall be properly connected with a public water supply system and shall be constructed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots shown on the subdivision plat for both domestic use and fire protection. 
The entire cost and expense of constructing and installing water mains and service lines, and of constructing and installing necessary main or mains required to extend a public water supply system to the particular subdivision, including without limitation the cost of pipes, valves and fittings, the opening or digging of necessary ditches, backfill, and the laying and covering of the water mains and service lines, shall be borne and be paid by the developer, but same shall be constructed and installed by the City acting by and through the Murfreesboro Water Resources Department (MWRD) and the City's Water Resources Board, either directly with its own forces and equipment or by contract with eligible and qualified contractor or contractors. Should the City elect to not utilize the foregoing procedure, the Department will require the developer to: contract with a reputable, licensed contractor and perform the work pursuant to plans and specifications approved by the City and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation; fully insure the City against all claims; furnish a bond or letter of credit to assure proper performance and payment of the work; reimburse the City for costs; and, follow MWRD Policies, Procedures and General Design Requirements which have been approved by the Water Resources Board and City Council, one copy of which is on file with the City Recorder. 
Except as otherwise allowed in MWRD Policies, Procedures and General Design Requirements, the minimum size of water lines shall be eight inches in diameter in all cases. Where the City's master planning for water lines or water system extensions indicates or requires a water line larger than eight inches, or in any case or situation where the MWRD Director shall find and determine that a water line larger than eight inches is then needed or probably in the future will be needed to serve other area or areas in the vicinity of or beyond the limits of the particular subdivision, then such larger water line as determined and fixed by the MWRD Director shall be required to be installed at the cost of the developer as hereinabove provided before the proposed subdivision of such developer shall be approved. MWRD's Policies, Procedures, and General Design Requirements identify criteria whereby MWRD, with approval of the Water Resources Board and the City Council, may participate in funding upsized water line or water system facilities of a proposed development. 
MWRD shall provide for water taps for each and every lot within the subdivision, the fees or charges for such taps to be paid at the rate provided for in the City's water rate schedules. 
The developer shall bear the expense and costs of fire hydrants in such number and at such locations as shall be determined by the MWRD Director in accordance with the applicable codes. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereinbefore in this section provided or to be implied therefrom, neither the City nor MWRD is obligated to extend water service to any subdivision or area outside of the Department's water service area, and neither the City nor MWRD is obligated by any provision or provisions of this section with respect to any such subdivision or area, unless and until the City Council specifically approves such extension of water service and fix and determine the terms and conditions under which such service shall be extended, and unless and until City Council specifically obligates MWRD with respect to such provision or provisions. 
(B)  Notwithstanding subsection (A) above, when the proposed subdivision or subdivision lot is in the Consolidated Utility District (CUD) water service area, then the water lines shall be connected with the CUD water supply system and shall be constructed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots shown on the subdivision plat for both domestic use and fire protection. It will be necessary for the developer or owner to satisfy all regulations of both CUD and the City in providing water for domestic use and fire protection.

Section 29-10 - Sanitary sewers. 
When located within the service area of the City sewerage system, sanitary sewers, including laterals to serve each lot within the subdivision (which shall be capped or plugged off until sewerage service through same may be required), shall be installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots with connection to such sewerage system. 
The entire cost of constructing and installing such sewers and laterals and of constructing and installing necessary outfall or interceptor sewer or sewers required to extend the City's sewerage systems to the particular subdivision, including without limitation the cost of pipes, manholes and fittings, the opening or digging of necessary ditches, backfilling, and the laying and covering of the sewers and laterals, shall be borne and be paid by the developer, but same shall be constructed and installed by MWRD, either directly with its own forces and equipment or by contract with eligible and qualified contractor or contractors. Should the City elect to not utilize the foregoing procedure, MWRD will require the developer to: contract with a reputable, licensed contractor and perform the work pursuant to plans and specifications approved by the City and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation; fully insure the City against all claims; furnish a bond or letter of credit to assure proper performance and payment of the work; reimburse the City for costs; and, follow MWRD's Policies, Procedures and General Design Requirements, three copies of which are on file with the City Recorder. 
Except as otherwise allowed in MWRD's Policies, Procedures and General Design Requirements, the minimum size of sanitary sewer mains is eight inches in diameter in all cases. Where the City's master planning for sanitary sewers or sewerage system extensions indicates or requires a sanitary sewer larger than eight inches, or in any case or situation where the MWRD Director finds and determines that a sewer larger than eight inches is needed or will be needed in the future to serve other area or: areas in the vicinity of or beyond the limits of the particular subdivision, then a larger sewer line as determined by the MWRD Director will be installed at the cost of the developer as hereinabove provided before the proposed subdivision may be approved. MWRD's Policies, Procedures, and General Design Requirements identify criteria whereby the Department, with approval of the Water and Sewer Department Board and the City Council, may participate in funding upsized sanitary sewer facilities of a proposed development. The size and type or kind of pipes and fittings to be used for laterals to serve the lots in the subdivision, the location of the sewers and laterals, the types or kinds of pipes and fittings to be used for sewers, the location, number and types of manholes, the width and depth of the ditch, the amount and method of making soil cover over the pipes or sewers and other features of the installation all shall conform with accepted standards established by the City and approved in writing by the MWRD Director. 
MWRD shall furnish sewer connections for each and every lot within the subdivision, the fees or charges for such connections to be paid by the builder at the City's rates therefor at the time in force and effect. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereinabove in this section provided or to be implied therefrom, MWRD is not obligated to extend sewer service to any subdivision or area outside the corporate limits of the City and is not so obligated by any provision or provisions of this section with respect to any such subdivision or area, until the City Council specifically approves such extension of such service and determines the terms and conditions under which such service shall be extended. 
Where a subdivision or the lots located therein for any reason cannot be economically connected with the City's or other sewerage system, or where for any reason the City Council declines to extend its sewerage or service to a subdivision or any of the lots therein, the lots in said subdivision not connected or to be connected to the City's or such other sewerage system must contain adequate area for installation of approved septic tank and disposal fields based on a percolation test and must be approved in writing by the county health officer and MWRD Director.

(A)  Green indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn; but vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
(2)  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(3)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in Code § 32-406, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.

(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subsection (C)(2). 
(2)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn [or left at the intersection of two one-way streets] after coming to a full and complete stop as required by subsection (C)(1). Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(3)  On intersection approaches clearly marked with signs indicating "no turn(s) on red" or other similarly prohibitive message, the provisions of subsection (C)(2) shall not apply. 
(4)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Code § 32-406, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(D)  In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

If the applicant or driver does not have a valid Tennessee driver's license, the applicant shall not be considered a fit and proper person. The minimum age for a driver on the MPD call list is 18 years of age. If the applicant or driver has been convicted of the felony of theft, fraud, the sale or distribution of narcotics, burglary, or similar crimes of dishonesty within the past six years, the applicant shall not be considered a fit and proper person to serve on the MPD call list, subject however, to the due process rights set forth in Code § 32-3017(F) where the applicant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that exclusion would be unfair, arbitrary, or capricious. 
(4)  That the requirements of this article and all other governing laws and ordinances have been met. 
(B)  A second license will not entitle the wrecker service to a second position on the call list of the MPD unless the applicant clearly shows and demonstrates that the second business is a distinct and different business from the first which holds a license. If the second business (i) is located on the same zone lot as a business holding a license; or (ii) utilizes the same phone system as a business holding a license; or (iii) utilizes the same equipment in whole or part as a business holding a license; or (iv) utilizes the same storage lot owned or under lease by a business holding a license and one of factors (i), (ii), (iii), or (v) is also present; or (v) utilizes the services of an employee of a wrecker service holding a license and one of factor (i) through (iv) is also present, it shall be conclusively presumed that the second applicant is the same as the first for the purposes of this article and as it applies to the privilege of the applicant to participate in the MPD call list. 
(C)  If the wrecker service changes 50% or more ownership, it will be removed from the City rotation or call list until a new license is issued, at which time the wrecker service will be treated as a new business for the purpose of the MPD call list. Notice shall be given to the City within 30 days of any such transfer.

No person other than the UEO, designee, or a contractor employed by the UEO, may perform any of the following acts on a tree in a public area without first obtaining a permit: plant, maintain, treat, prune, remove, replant, replace or otherwise disturb any tree. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit owners of property adjacent to public areas from watering, without a permit, any tree, located on such public areas, subject to subsection (E)(2) herein. Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt any person from the requirements of obtaining any additional permits as required law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an owner or developer who receives site plan approval that includes a landscape plan shall not be required to obtain an additional permit for trees in the street or highway right-of-way at the approved site. 
(2)  Application for permit. 
(a)  Application for a permit must be made not less than three working days prior to the time the work is to be done. An application may be made by telephone or by fax. The person to whom the permit is issued shall abide by the Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice. 
(b)  Any person planning to excavate in order to perform work must comply with T.C.A. § 65-31-101 et seq. and this chapter.

Any permit granted shall contain a definite date of expiration and the work shall be completed in the time allowed on the permit and in the manner therein described. A violation of any of its terms shall render a permit null and void. 
(4)  Notice of completion. A notice of completion shall be provided within five days after the completion date for purposes of inspecting the work. The notice may be by telephone. 
(B)  Planting. 
(1)  Application data. The application required herein shall state the number of trees to be planted, the location, the species, cultivar or variety of each tree, the method of planting, and such other information which may reasonably be required in order to make a fair determination as to whether a permit should be issued. 
(2)  Improper planting. Whenever any tree shall be planted or set out so as to be in conflict with the provisions of this section, it shall be lawful for the City to remove, or cause to be removed, such offending trees, and the cost for the removal thereof shall be assessed to the owner, subject to the right to a due process hearing before the Tree Board. A statement of the cost incurred by the City shall be filed with the City Recorder or designee. A lien is hereby declared on such person's abutting property for all costs and expenses incurred by the City. The responsible party shall be liable for the total costs incurred by the City, together with an administrative handling expense of an additional 20%. 
All uncollected costs for the current year shall be certified by the City Recorder on or before December 31 st of each year. When taxes are collected for the next succeeding year, the City Recorder shall collect any such certified amount as a special tax against the property owner's abutting real estate.

(3)  Drainage ditch. Nothing shall be planted in a City drainage ditch. 
(4)  Distance from travel lane. No tree shall be planted within 12 ft. of the traveled portion of any major arterial or collector street with a speed limit greater than 40 miles per hour. Where existing tree distances outside curbs or edges of travel lanes have been established, replacement trees may be allowed to conform with those established set-back distances. Planting that involves exceptions to this criteria will be considered on an individual basis. 
(C)  Maintenance. The application required herein shall state the number and kinds of trees to be sprayed, fertilized, pruned, or otherwise preserved on public area; the type of treatment to be administered; the composition of the spray material to be applied; and such other maintenance information which may reasonably be required in order to make a fair determination as to whether a permit should be issued. 
(D)  Tree topping. Topping a tree is defined as the severe cutting or heading back of limbs to stubs larger than two inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. As a normal practice it shall be unlawful for any person, firm, public utility, or City department to top any tree on public areas. At the discretion of the UEO trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this chapter. Anyone desiring to prune a tree on public areas must obtain a permit. 
(E)  Removal, replanting, and replacement. 
(1)  (a)  Whenever the City, utility, or government agency causing the removal determines it necessary to remove a tree or trees from a public area in connection with the construction or repair of a sidewalk or the paving or widening of a street or highway used in vehicular traffic, the City, utility, or government agency causing the removal shall replant such trees or replace them. In the event conditions prevent the replanting (i.e., loss or reduction of planting area, visibility, etc.) the requirement for replanting shall be satisfied by the planting of an equivalent number of approved trees in other similar location(s). 
(b)  Any City, utility or government agency shall give notice of intent (fax notice to UEO is acceptable) to remove a tree or trees from a public area a minimum of seven working days prior to removal to the UEO so the UEO may investigate and offer reasonable alternatives when any exist. Any designation of a tree as a landmark tree must be made prior to the aforementioned seven-day notice. 
(c)  Any utility shall appoint a designated person to act as the liaison between it and the UEO. The person designated shall be responsible for coordinating all proposed utility construction projects that involve trees, prior to the commencement of work. 
(2)  No person or property owner shall remove a tree from a public area for the purpose of construction, or for any other reason, without first applying for and procuring a permit; and any tree or trees removed shall be replaced in accordance with the Arboricultural Specifications Manual. Such replacement shall meet the standards set forth on the permit. The person or property owner shall bear the cost of removal (to include the stump), clean-up, and replacement of all trees removed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a property owner may remove a tree the property owner planted, without first obtaining a permit for removal, provided the tree was not planted (i) as a replacement tree pursuant to this subsection (E) herein, or (ii) was not a tree planted as required by the landscaping provisions of Appendix A - Zoning. 
(F)  A municipal register shall be established and maintained for landmark trees. The Urban Environmental Department shall periodically conduct a survey to locate trees eligible for landmark tree designation. Enrollment shall be accomplished through identification and nomination of an individual tree or tree group by a municipal official, citizen, or property owner subject to review and approval by the Department. A tree on private property may not be designated a landmark tree without the consent of the property owner(s). Owners of private property may nominate a tree or tree group located on their property for landmark tree designation and registration in the municipal register; and in the event such trees are approved and enrolled, they shall be subject to the rules, regulations and requirements prescribed by this chapter.

Section 32.5-7 - Abuse or mutilation of trees. 
(A)  The provisions of this section apply to any tree in a public area and to any tree having landmark designation. Unless specifically authorized by the Urban Environmental Department, no person shall intentionally damage, cut, carve, transplant, or remove any tree; attach any rope, wire, nails, advertising posters, or other contrivance to any tree; allow any gaseous liquid or solid or impervious (such as concrete or asphalt) substance which is harmful to such trees and/or their root systems to come into contact with them; or set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof may injure any portion of the tree; permit grade changes around trees; or permit storage of materials within driplines. 
(B)  Trees having landmark designation shall be protected on public and private property from damage or removal. 
(C)  Once a tree has been designated a landmark tree and enrolled in the municipal register of landmark trees, it may be removed only if, in the opinion of the Department the tree poses a danger of spreading disease or infection to surrounding healthy trees, it presents a hazard to structures, property, or persons, or it substantially or materially restricts the economic enjoyment of the property. An applicant denied permission to remove a landmark tree by the Department may appeal such decision to the Tree Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a landmark tree damaged during a storm which poses an immediate threat to public safety or private property may be removed to the extent necessary to eliminate the threat to public safety or private property without consideration by the Department.

[aa]  Haulers must complete and submit a manifest for each load discharged, identifying the exact source(s) of the hauled material, including name, complete address, telephone number, waste characteristics, and approximate gallons for each site pumped, as well as the permit number of the hauler, vehicle license number and signature of the driver. 
[bb]  Any haulage that does not originate from a single-family dwelling must include the generator's signature. 
[cc]  Manifests shall conform to the sample provided by the Department, are due on the day of discharge to the sanitary system, and should be deposited in the receptacle provided at the receiving station. 
[6]  Hauled Septage Fees: 
[aa]  Fees shall be established and approved by City Council for activities related to septage hauling, including permit application and renewal, vehicle registration, and discharge to the POTW. 
[bb]  Laboratory analysis fees shall be assessed in accordance with Code § 33-42 when evidence indicates that the permit holder has discharged prohibited materials. 
(d)  Any waters or wastes which may violate pretreatment standards as adopted by EPA or any modification thereof which may be permitted by approval authorities. 
(e)  Any waters or wastes having toxic, poisonous or incompatible pollutants in such quantities as to constitute a hazard to humans or animals, be deleterious to pipelines or structures, interfere with treatment processes or cause the treatment plant to violate its NPDES permit or applicable receiving water standards. 
(C)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards - Users must comply with the categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. 
(1)  Where a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with Section 33-36(C)(4). 
(2)  When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users. 
(3)  When wastewater subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the Director may impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(4)  When a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the City convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Director. The City may establish equivalent mass limits only if the Industrial User meets all the conditions set forth in Sections 33-36(C)(4)(a)[1] through 33-36(C)(4)(a)[5] below. 
(a)  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User must: 
[1]  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
[2]  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
[3]  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
[4]  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the Discharge; and 
[5]  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User's request for equivalent mass limits. 
(b)  An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
[1]  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
[2]  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
[3]  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the Director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph 2.2F(1)(c) of this Section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
[4]  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraphs 2.2E(1)(a) of this Section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
(c)  When developing equivalent mass limits, the Director: 
[1]  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the Industrial User by the concentration-based Daily Maximum and Monthly Average Standard for the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
[2]  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
[3]  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the Industrial User's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section 2.6. The Industrial User must also be in compliance with Section 13.3 regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
(5)  The Director may convert the mass limits of the categorical Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Director. When converting such limits to concentration limits, the Director will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by paragraph 2.6 of this ordinance (see 40 CFR 403.6(d)). In addition, the Director will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits, or vice versa, and make this information publicly available (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)). 
(6)  Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in lieu of the promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)). 
(7)  Where categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum Monthly Average, or 4-day average, limitations, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
(D)  State Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Pretreatment Standards Rules Chapter 1200-04-14. 
(E)  Industrial User Production Levels. Any Industrial User operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based Standard shall notify the Director within two business days after the User has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any User not notifying the Director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9)). 
(F)  Local Limits. 
(1)  The Director is authorized to establish instantaneous, Daily Maximum or Monthly Average Local Limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). 
The ability of the wastewater treatment facility to function effectively and meet effluent limitations is contingent upon the incoming wastewater flow being within the Plant Protection Criteria parameters. 
Additional substances may be added to the Plant Protection Criteria whenever there is a reason to suspect the presence of such substances in quantities such as to interfere with the proper functioning of the treatment facility or its ability to meet effluent standards or when the effluent limits for discharge of wastewater plant effluent are changed. 
Policies for the control of regulated discharges in order to achieve and maintain plant protection criteria shall be proposed by the Director and recommended by the Board to the City Council, which shall adopt them by resolution. Such policies shall include provision for any regulated discharger to request and receive a hearing before the Board in regard to establishment of discharge conditions or violations thereof. 
The Director may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentration-based limitations of the adopted Plant Protection Criteria. 
(2)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors and grease bins shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. Each interceptor shall be of a type and capacity specifically approved by the Director and shall be located in a site specifically approved by the Director. 
Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable covers, which, when bolted in place shall be gas tight and watertight. 
Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at the owner's expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. 
Whenever blockages occur downstream from the owner, the Director may require the owner to submit regular reports of pumping grease, oil and sand interceptors, or other actions taken by the owner to alleviate reoccurrence. 
(3)  Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Control Plans. The Director shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control Slug Discharges, and may require any User to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control Slug Discharges. Alternatively, the Director may develop such a plan for any User. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(a)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
(b)  Description of stored chemicals, including quantities and chemical properties; 
(c)  Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of any accidental or Slug Discharge, which include the permanent posting on the User's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees to call the POTW in the event of such discharge and listing the current telephone number for the POTW. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(d)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or Slug Discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. All production facilities, including chemical storage areas, shall be open to inspection by the Director as required. 
(e)  Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug Discharge. 
(4)  Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this chapter. 
(5)  Dilution. No User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on Users who are using or suspected of using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(G)  Discharge Permit Required. 
(1)  Each Industrial User proposing to discharge to the sanitary sewer wastes of any description, exclusive of sanitary wastes, shall file with the Director an application for the discharge of such wastes at least 90 days prior to the commencement of discharge. 
(2)  An Industrial User Discharge Permit shall be: 
(a)  Issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years from the effective date of the permit, or may be issued for a period less than five years, at the discretion of the Director. Each IUDP will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire. 
(b)  Such permit is nontransferable unless it meets the requirements set forth in Code § 33-36(G)(10). 
(c)  The permit shall specify effluent limits, concentration, and/or mass loading limits, including Best Management Practices based on applicable general pretreatment standards in TN Rule 1200-4-14-08(6)(a)3.(iii). 
(d)  Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and record-keeping requirements. These requirements shall include an identification of pollutants (or best management practice) to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type based on Federal, State, and local law. 
(e)  A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of Pretreatment Standards and Requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance beyond that required by applicable Federal, State, or local law. 
(f)  Requirements to control Slug Discharge, if determined by the Director to be necessary. 
(g)  Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Application Contents: 
[1]  All Users required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit must submit a permit application. The Director may require Users to submit all or some of the following information as part of a permit application:

[hh]  Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Director to evaluate the permit application. 
[ii]  Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the User for revision. 
(3)  An IUDP does not relieve the permittee of any responsibility for compliance with all Federal, State or Local pretreatment standards, including those which become effective during the term of the permit. 
(4)  The expiration date of a permit shall be not construed as permission to exceed the limits set by the permit after the permit has expired. 
(5)  It shall be the responsibility of existing Industrial Users to file new or updated data with the Director whenever: 
(a)  The current permit period expires; 
(b)  Prior to a substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous waste for which the Industrial User has submitted initial notification under TN Rule 1200-4-14-.12(10). 
(c)  Prior to any change of ownership or location.

The application shall further describe the discharge rates and hours of operation. This description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes, as well as site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans, and details to show all sewers, floor drains, and appurtenances by size, location, and elevation, and all points of discharge; a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility shall be appended to the application. 
(7)  Confidential Information. Information and data on a User obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Director's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the User specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the User furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(8)  Permit applications, industry-generated reports and written acknowledgement of directions to the industry by the City shall be signed by a corporate officer or duly authorized representative provided the authorization is made in writing to the Director. If the authorization is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for overall operation of the facility, a new authorization must be submitted to the Director within 30 days. 
(9)  A fee shall be assessed for processing all Industrial User permit applications. The fee shall be set by the City Council upon recommendation of the Board and shall be subject to periodic review and adjustment. 
(10)  Transfer of Industrial User Discharge Permit. An IUDP may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee submits a written request to the Director at least 90 days in advance of the change in ownership or operator, and the Director approves the transfer of the permit. The notice to the Director must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
(a)  States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes; 
(b)  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
(c)  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(d)  Provision of a copy of the existing permit to the new owner and/or operator. 
Failure to provide advance request for a transfer renders the existing IUDP void as of the date of facility transfer. 
(11)  The Director may require updated information or additional data from any Industrial User at any time and failure to respond in a timely manner shall constitute a violation of the discharge permit conditions. 
(12)  The Director shall provide written acknowledgement of the application and will either approve or reject the request to discharge or, when necessary request more data. If the application is approved, the City will issue a discharge permit setting forth the conditions under which the wastes may be discharged to the sewers. The permit shall set specific limits for toxic and other pollutants. For categorical industries, these limits shall be those specified by federal and state regulations, except where more stringent limits are required to protect the POTW processes or effluent. Flow, conventional, and nonconventional pollutants may be limited for significant non-categorical Users. 
(13)  The permit may be revoked at any time for good and sufficient cause as described in Code §§ 33-37 and 33-40. 
(14)  Compliance by existing sources with categorical Pretreatment Standards shall be within three years of the date the Standard is effective unless shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR chapter 1, subchapter N. Existing Sources which become Industrial Users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard shall be considered existing Industrial Users except where such sources meet the definition of a New Source. New Sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall "start up", all pollution control equipment required to meet all applicable Pretreatment Standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not exceeding 90 days), New Sources must meet all applicable Pretreatment Standards. 
(15)  Where pretreatment is required, such equipment shall be operated continuously during periods of discharge. 
(16)  Any industry discharging industrial process wastes of any description shall install a suitable monitoring manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner's expense and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(17)  Any industry discharging industrial process wastes of any description shall be charged a surveillance fee as recommended by the Board and approved by the City Council to compensate the City for the added cost of collecting and analyzing waste samples on a periodic basis to insure compliance with the terms of this article. Results of such analyses will be furnished to the industry. The surveillance fee shall be levied in addition to all other applicable charges, Users fee and/or taxes, and shall be subject to adjustment on an annual basis. 
(18)  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. Sampling and analysis of industrial discharges shall be conducted as deemed necessary by the Director. No person shall interfere with the collection of a representative sample during any condition of flow by intentionally diluting for the purpose of altering the sample or discharge flow, intentionally altering the sample or discharge flow to produce inaccurate test values, diverting flows around sampling points, disconnecting or disrupting the operation of samplers, discharging in such a manner as to avoid sampling, or taking any other action to defeat sampling. [Note: The Control Authority is required to indicate the frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by the User with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.] 
(a)  Except as indicated in Sections (b) and (c) below, the User must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Department, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Department, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(c)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required [Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(2) and (4)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.12(5) and (8), the Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. 
(19)  Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Director or other parties approved by EPA. 
(a)  If an Industrial User subject to the reporting requirement in TN Rule 1200-4-14-.12(5) or (8) monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the Director, using the procedures in paragraph (19), the results of this monitoring shall be included in this report. 
(b)  The reports required by TN rule 1200-4-14-.12(2)(4)(5) and (8) must be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performs during the period covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The Director shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to access and assure compliance by Industrial Users with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director, the samples must be a representative of the discharge, and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the Industrial User file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil & grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Director, as appropriate. 
(20)  Automatic samplers may be required: 
(a)  Where the nature of the manufacturing operation or process wastes provides a reasonable possibility for an accidental or intentional discharge in violation of this chapter. 
(b)  Where the installation of such monitoring unit is a condition for acceptance of the wastes in the public sewer. 
(c)  Where accidental or intentional interference with the collection of a representative sample is detected on more than one occasion during a 12-month period. 
Where automatic sampling and/or monitoring units are utilized, the Industrial User shall provide all necessary site modifications, provide the necessary electricity, and shall pay an additional monthly rental on the unit(s). The rental charge shall be based on the cost of purchasing and maintaining the unit(s). The monthly rental charge shall be established by action of the Board and approval by the City Council and shall be subject to periodic review. 
(21)  The results of any sampling and analysis of industrial discharge to the sanitary sewer conducted by or on behalf of an industry shall be forwarded to the Department. If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User may repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the Industrial User is not required if the City has performed the sampling at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the User or the Department receives the results of this sampling, or if the Department has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User. 
(22)  Waste concentration in excess of those prescribed by the Industrial User discharge permit: 
(a)  Wastes having an average five-day BOD in excess of 250 mg/L, edible oils in excess of 100 mg/L, suspended solids in excess of 300 mg/L or ammonia in excess of 15 mg/L may be accepted into the sanitary sewer subject to a surcharge in accordance with Code § 33-1 to cover the additional cost of treating such wastes. The surcharge will be based on the equally weighted average of all samples collected within the billing cycle and the metered water consumption (less any metered water excluded from the sewage system, if applicable, in accordance with Code § 33-51) or the metered sewage discharge. The surcharge shall be subject to review and adjustment on an annual basis to reflect changes in operating costs. 
(b)  Wastes having an ammonia concentration in excess of 150 mg/L, BOD in excess of 1,500 mg/L, edible oils in excess of 300 mg/L, or suspended solids in excess of 1,500 mg/L may be accepted into the sanitary sewer subject to a surcharge at twice the normal surcharge rate provided that these conventional and/or nonconventional pollutants do not result in upset, Pass Through or interference with the POTW processes. The surcharge calculation shall utilize one-fourth of the volume recorded for the 30-day billing period for each week or fraction thereof that the extraordinary concentration(s) occur. The maximum amount of the extraordinary surcharge shall not exceed the average total cost for POTW operation during the period of the discharge, plus the period required for recovery of the POTW processes when such processes are upset as a result of the extraordinary strength discharge(s). 
(c)  All applicable surcharges shall be independent of penalties which may be imposed for violation of Industrial User permit violations. 
(d)  The daily maximum limit for toxic pollutants shall be deemed in violation whenever the concentration of wastes collected within a 24-hour period are greater than or equal to twice the maximum monthly average specified in the Industrial User discharge permit and are subject to penalties as described in Code § 33-40. 
(e)  The monthly average maximum limit for toxic pollutant substances shall be deemed in violation whenever the average of all samples collected during the month exceeds the maximum monthly average specified in the Industrial User discharge permit and penalties shall be assessed in accordance with Code § 33-40. 
(f)  All Industrial Users shall notify the POTW immediately by telephone of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a Slug Discharge or Slug Load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the User. A notice shall be permanently posted on the User's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees to call the POTW in the event of a discharge as described Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)  Within five days following such discharge, the User shall, unless waived by the Director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this ordinance. 
(23)  If any discharge to the wastewater system, or any proposed discharge to the system is responsible for or is likely to be responsible for an Upset, Interference, or Pass Through violation at the POTW, the Director may take any action necessary to: 
(a)  Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater. 
(b)  Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications will reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with this article. 
(c)  Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics or substances so that the discharge will not violate these rules and regulations. 
(d)  Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or necessary to achieve the purpose of this article. 
(24)  Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater flows prior to discharge into any part of the wastewater treatment system is required, plans, specifications and other pertinent data or information relating to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall first be submitted to the Director for review and approval. Such approval shall not exempt the discharge or such facilities from compliance with any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to and prior approval of the Director. 
(25)  Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any water or waste, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at the owner's expense, and bypass of such pretreatment facilities is prohibited unless: 
(a)  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(b)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime; 
(c)  This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(d)  The User submitted notices as required under paragraph (27) of this section. 
For the purposes of this subsection: 
[1]  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a User's treatment facility. 
[2]  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if it is determined that it will meet the three conditions listed in this paragraph (25), or it is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation and will not cause the Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated. 
(26)  Each Industrial User shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or operator's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Director for review, and shall be approved before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the Industrial User from the responsibility to modify the facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
(27)  If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. In the event that an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards, the User shall submit oral notice to the Director within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(28)  A Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Re-sampling by the Industrial User is not required if the Department performs sampling at the User's facility at least once a month, or if the Department performs sampling at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the User or the Department receives the results of this sampling, or if the Department has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User. 
(29)  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and waste to which reference is made throughout this Chapter shall be determined in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 136 or equivalent methods approved by EPA and shall be determined at the control manhole provided for in subsection (16) herein. 
(30)  Any User of the public sewer who discharges industrial waste or matter must satisfy and meet the United States Federal Government guidelines for pretreatment as may be prescribed from time to time by the Environmental Protection Agency or its successor agency and the guidelines for pretreatment as may be prescribed from time to time by the water quality control division of the Tennessee Department of Health and Environment or its successor agency and further must furnish at its own expense any additional monitoring equipment as reasonably may be necessary in the opinion of the Director of the Department. 
(31)  The Director must require appropriate reporting from those Industrial Users with discharges that are nor subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards. Significant Non-Categorical Users must submit to the Control Authority at least once every six months (on dates specified by the Director) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of pollutants required to be reported by the Control Authority. In cases where local limit requires compliance with Best Management Practice or pollution prevention alternative, the User must submit documentation required by the Control Authority to determine the compliance status of the User. These reports must be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and in accordance with the sampling techniques described in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the Control Authority in lieu of the significant noncategorical industrial user. 
The Director may require categorical Users to submit semi-annual self-monitoring reports to the Department. These reports shall describe effluent quality (analysis) and quantity (flow measurement), significant changes in operations or processes, personnel, hours of operation, and current solvent management and hazardous waste disposal. The reports shall include the results of all sampling and actions by the User during the period covered by the report. The report shall indicate the time, date, location of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected discharges to the POTW and that it has been done by a qualified professional in accordance with prescribed methods. 
In the event that the User is not meeting IUDP limits, the report shall contain a proposed compliance schedule which shall incorporate the major events leading to compliance; i.e., the hiring of a consulting engineer, submission of pretreatment plans and specifications, construction timetables, etc., where applicable. The City may accept, reject or modify the proposed compliance schedule, issue a different compliance schedule, revised IUDP or administrative order. The Director may require more frequent reporting from any categorical or Significant Industrial User. 
(32)  Certification statement. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by a duly Authorized Representative of Users submitting permit applications, baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with the Categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic compliance reports. 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who managed the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
The certificate statement shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer or a duly authorized representative as described in subsection (G)(5) of this section, and shall bear the name and title of that officer or representative. 
(33)  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with Best Management Practices. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User or the City, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director. 
(34)  Date of Receipt of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(35)  Violations of this article may include any or all of the following actions, none of which are necessarily prerequisite to another. 
(a)  Notice of Violation (NOV). Whenever the Department finds that any User has violated or is violating this article, or a discharge permit or order issued hereunder, the Director or agent may serve upon such User a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the Director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent Orders (CO). The Director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the User responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders. 
(c)  Administrative Orders (AO). When the Director finds that a User has violated the article or a permit or order issued thereunder, the Director may issue an order to the User responsible directing that, following a specified period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to treatment technology, additional monitoring and management practices. 
(d)  Show cause hearing. The Director may order any User who causes or contributes to violations of this article or any permit or order issued hereunder to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and a request that the User show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail at least ten days prior to the hearing. Whether or not a duly notified User appears as noticed, immediate enforcement may be pursued. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the Department finds that a User has violated or is violating this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, the Director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to comply forthwith and/or take such appropriate action as may be needed to correct continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
(f)  Penalties. Notwithstanding any other portion of this article, any User who is found to have violated any provision of this article, permits or orders issued hereunder shall be assessed penalties in accordance with Code § 33-40. Such assessments may be added to the User's next scheduled sewer bill and the Director shall have such other collection remedies to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges and penalties shall constitute a lien against the User's property. Users desiring to dispute such charges must file a request for the Director to reconsider the penalty. Where the Director believes a request has merit, the Director shall convene a hearing on the matter within 30 days of receiving the request from the User. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The Director may suspend service to a User when it is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of a person, the POTW or the environment. In the event the User fails to voluntarily comply with the suspension order, the Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection. A User who is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit to the Director a detailed written report describing the causes of the event and the measures taken to prevent any further reoccurrence. The Director may allow the User to recommence discharge when the endangerment has passed. 
(h)  Revocation of a permit. Any User who violates the conditions of this article or a permit or order or any applicable state or federal law is subject to revocation of a discharge permit and to permanent termination of service. Causes include, but are not limited to: 
[1]  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application; 
[2]  Violation of permit conditions, pretreatment requirement, or this ordinance; 
[3]  Failure to accurately report wastewater constituents and discharge characteristics; 
[4]  Failure to notify the Director of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge;

[6]  Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; 
[7]  Tampering with monitoring equipment; 
[8]  Failure to pay sewer charges, administrative penalties or other fees; 
[9]  Failure to meet compliance deadlines; 
[10]  Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of ownership of the permitted facility; and 
[11]  Other actions which endanger the POTW processes, the health of individuals or the environment. 
(i)  Publication of violations. The Director shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by MWSD a list of the Users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in Significant Noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. The term Significant Noncompliance shall be applicable to all Significant Industrial Users or any other Industrial User that violates paragraphs (c), (d) or (h) of § 33-32(A)(73) and shall mean: 
[1]  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed by any magnitude a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including Instantaneous Limits as defined herein; 
[2]  Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including Instantaneous Limits, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
[3]  Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement such as Daily Maximum, long-term average, Instantaneous Limit, or narrative standard that the Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, Interference or Pass Through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
[4]  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Director's exercise of the emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
[5]  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
[6]  Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
[7]  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best Management Practices, which the Director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(j)  Enforcement response. Whenever the Director finds that any person has violated this article or any prohibition, limitation or requirement contained in this article or permit or order issued hereunder, the Director will initiate the appropriate enforcement response as outlined in the Enforcement Response Guide which is incorporated herein as if copied verbatim. The Enforcement Response Guide may be found on file for review in the City Recorder's office and on the City's web site at murfreesborotn.gov. 
(k)  Review hearing. Whenever a User believes that an enforcement response is in error, a hearing before the Board may be requested, provided that such request is made before the deadline specified by the enforcement response. The Board will review the noncompliance event and enforcement response at its next scheduled meeting and render a final decision. 
(l)  Legal action. Upon any indication of a lack of response to a duly-issued enforcement order, the matter will be referred to the City Attorney for appropriate legal action, including court citation. 
(36)  No Industrial User may accept or treat liquid wastes from any other site for the purpose of pretreatment and discharge to the public sewer system without such arrangement having been reviewed by the Board and approved in writing by the Director. 
(37)  Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this ordinance are not exclusive. The Director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant User. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City's enforcement response plan. However, the Director may take other action against any User when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant Use. 
(38)  The City of Murfreesboro has the legal authority to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by Industrial Users with Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. The City of Murfreesboro shall also have authority to seek or assess civil or criminal penalties in at least the amount of $1,000.00 a day for each violation by Industrial Users of Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. 
(H)  Baseline Monitoring Reports. Users that become subject to new or revised categorical Pretreatment Standards are required to comply with the following reporting requirements. 
(1)  Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical Pretreatment Standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(1)(d), whichever is later, existing Categorical Industrial Users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the Director a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2), below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, New Sources, and sources that become Categorical Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical Standard, shall submit to the Director a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2), below. A New Source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical Standards. A New Source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(2)  Users described above shall submit the information set forth below. 
(a)  All information required in § 33-36(G)(2)(g)(1)[aa] - [ii].

[2]  The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
[3]  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the User should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(5) to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(5), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the Director. 
[4]  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with § 33-36(G)(18) and (19). 
[5]  The Director may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
[6]  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant Discharges to the POTW. 
(c)  Compliance Certification. A statement, reviewed by the User's Authorized Representative as defined in § 33-32(A)(4) and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. 
(d)  Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the Pretreatment Standards, the shortest schedule by which the User will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this Section must meet the requirements set out below in (e). 
(e)  Compliance Schedule. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule: 
[1]  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the User to meet the applicable Pretreatment Standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
[2]  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
[3]  The User shall submit a progress report to the Director no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the User to return to the established schedule; and 
[4]  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the Director. 
(f)  Signature and Report Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with § 33-36(G)(32) of this ordinance and signed by an Authorized Representative as defined in § 33-32(A)(4). 
(3)  Compliance schedule for meeting categorical Pretreatment Standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by (2)(e) of this section: 
(a)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the Industrial User to meet the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, etc.). 
(b)  No increment referred to in subparagraph(a) of this chapter shall exceed nine months. 
(c)  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the Industrial User shall submit a progress report to the Control Authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the Industrial User to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the Control Authority. 
(I)  Affirmative Defenses To Discharge Violations. 
(1)  Upset: 
(a)  For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the User. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
(c)  A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
[1]  An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
[2]  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
[3]  The User has submitted the following information to the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
[aa]  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
[bb]  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
[cc]  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(2)  Prohibited Discharge Standards. A User shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 33-36(A)(1) of this ordinance or the specific prohibitions in § 33-36(A)(2)(a)(b)(f)(h)(m)(n) of this ordinance if: 
(a)  It can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference; and 
(b)  A Local Limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the Pass Through or Interference; or 
(c)  No Local Limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior discharge when the Department was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of Interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(3)  Bypass: 
(a)  For the purposes of this Section: 
[1]  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a User's treatment facility. 
[2]  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraph (c) below and paragraph (4) of this Section. 
(c)  Bypass Notifications: 
[1]  If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
[2]  A User shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Bypass: 
(a)  Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless: 
[1]  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
[2]  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
[3]  The User submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(b)  The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed above in paragraph (a) of this Section. 
(Ord. No. 75-1 §§ 5-7, 02-27-75; Ord. No. 82-2 § 1, 03-18-82; Ord. No. 86-11 § 1, 03-20-86; Ord. No. 90-47 §§ 4-16, 10-11-90; Ord. No. 94-O-05 §§ 1-4, 03-03-94, Ord. No. 98-O-53R §§ 12-26, 01-18-01; Ord. No. 01-O-35 § 6, 10-18-01; Ord. No. 08-O-22 § 11, 07-01-10; Ord. No. 18-O-47 , § 7, 8-16-18) 
Section 33-37 - Termination of service. 
(A)  Whenever the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may serve upon that User a written Notice of Violation. Within ten days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the User to the Director. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. 
(B)  Emergency Suspensions. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. 
(1)  The Director may immediately suspend a User's discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director may also immediately suspend a User's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(2)  Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. the Director may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed. 
(3)  A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing. 
(4)  Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any Emergency Suspension under this Section. 
(C)  Consent Orders. The Director may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(D)  Show Cause Hearing. The Director may order a User which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Director to show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(E)  Compliance Orders. When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(F)  Cease and Desist Orders. When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User's past violations are likely to recur the Director may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to:

Users guilty of violating this chapter are subject to termination of water and sewer service. 
In addition to the foregoing, a user reasonably suspected of a violation of this subsection may be subject to immediate termination of water and sewer service, subject to the user's right to a due process hearing before the Director or designee. Nothing herein shall impair or prevent the Director from pursuing a criminal action under the general laws of the State of Tennessee, at the discretion of the Director in addition to any of the foregoing consequences of a violation of this chapter. 
(B)  Values obtained at the POTW laboratory or from independent laboratories selected by the Department shall be used to determine compliance with the IUDP for conventional and/or nonconventional pollutants and for toxic pollutants with limited sample holding times. 
(C)  Values obtained at the POTW laboratory shall be used to determine compliance with the IUDP unless challenged within the allowable holding time of the sample, as determined by 40 CFR Part 136 or equivalent methods approved by EPA, or within, but in no case later than, ten days after notification of the violation. Whenever a value obtained by the POTW laboratory indicates that a violation has occurred, the industry involved may challenge the POTW analysis. Whenever a value obtained by the POTW laboratory is challenged by an industrial user, a portion of the sample in question shall be sent to a laboratory approved by the State of Tennessee for the analysis in question. In the event that the value obtained by such approved laboratory indicates no violation has occurred, the City shall concur that no violation has occurred and the cost of the additional analysis by such approved laboratory shall be borne by the City. In the event that the value obtained by such approved laboratory indicates that a violation has occurred, the industrial user shall be assessed an amount equal to twice the amount invoiced by the approved laboratory to recover the costs of sampling and analysis, plus the amount of any penalty(s) and/or costs specified in the provisions of this article. 
(D)  To prevent penalties from being imposed as a result of inherent analytical imprecision, the penalties specified in this section shall only be imposed whenever any limit is exceeded, and the value obtained is at least twice the analytical detection limit for the method employed to obtain the value, except when this limit is not met but the POTW has been assessed penalties by state and/or federal agencies as a result of the industrial discharge, in which case the amount of civil penalties and/or fines assessed against the City by state and/or federal regulatory agencies plus any costs incurred by the City in defending itself, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness expenses and court reporter fees, against such charges arising from the IUDP/NPDES violation. In the event the POTW has been assessed penalties as a result of violations described above, the greater of the penalties in this section or those above shall be applicable. 
(E)  Any person violating any section of this article except as described in subsections (A)(1) through (6) of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined an amount not exceeding $200.00 for each violation. 
(F)  Each day in which any such violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense. Any fine provided for in this section shall be in addition to damages to which the City may be entitled to pursuant to other provisions of this article including Code §§ 33-1 and 33-37 and as may otherwise be provided by law. 
(G)  The issuance of a notice of violation, administrative order or compliance schedule shall not relieve the recipient of any penalties that result from failure to comply with the provisions of this article. 
(H)  Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the City for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the City by reason of such violation including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, expert witness expenses, and court reporter fees, or, in addition to any other penalty, fine, charge or assessment. 
(I)  Whenever an industrial discharger enters into a consent order with the Department to correct discharge violations, the Department, through its Director, may agree for potential penalties or portions thereof to be applied toward the purchase of capital equipment in those cases where it can be demonstrated to the Department that such capital equipment will enable the user to achieve compliance with the IUDP. 
(1)  This section (I) shall not allow a user to discharge without a permit or in violation of a permit, or to make changes such as those described in Code § 33-36(G) without filing an application for a new permit. 
(2)  Consent orders shall contain a schedule for specific actions to be taken by the user to correct noncompliance. The Department may agree for the schedule to be modified for good and sufficient reason provided that the user files a written request documenting the reason for the request prior to the date(s) specified in the consent order for which the modification is requested. 
(3)  Consent orders will not be allowed whenever the industrial user permit violations have resulted in pass-through, interference or upset violation(s) of the municipal NPDES permit. 
(4)  Failure to comply with a consent order may result in the enforcement of the other provisions of this article, in addition to any penalties specified in the consent order. 
(J)  Septage Haulers. Any person who violates the terms of a septage hauler permit by hauling substances prohibited by the permit or who misrepresents the point of septage origin shall be subject to penalties as follows: 
(1)  First offense, loss of permit for six months; 
(2)  Second offense, permanent loss of permit; and, 
(3)  In addition to the penalties described, septage haulers shall be subject to the same penalties as industrial users with regards to discharge of prohibited and controlled substances. 
(K)  Any user violating the terms of this article such that line stoppage occurs shall be subject to the following administrative penalties: 
(1)  First offense - All costs associated with cleaning the sewer lines and restoring service to the affected areas, plus any damages as may be assessed under Code § 33-43; 
(2)  Successive occurrences within 12 months of the previous occurrence - A $1,000.00 penalty plus all costs associated with cleaning the sewer lines and restoring service to the affected areas, plus any damages as may be assessed under Code § 33-43; 
Penalties shall be applied to and become part of the regular customer billing. 
(L)  Any person charged with violating the IUDP or any provision of this chapter shall receive written notice of the charge from the Director of the Department or designee and given an opportunity for a hearing before the Director or designee. Upon receipt of a notice of violation, the person must file written request for a hearing within ten days of receipt with the City Recorder to be entitled to a hearing. Any finding, determination, and/or assessment made by the Director or designee may be appealed to the Board, provided the appeal is made within ten days of the written decision of the Director, by filing written notice of the appeal with the City Recorder of the City of Murfreesboro, Murfreesboro City Hall, 111 W.

(h)  Demolition of an existing commercial or industrial building and construction of a new building; but not for replacement of same or similar building destroyed by fire or tornado, provided such building was not vacant for 12 consecutive months next preceding the fire or tornado. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any applicant who demolishes an existing industrial or commercial building and constructs a new building on the same lot of record for the same type use or a use with a "similar" water consumption in the sole discretion of the Board, shall be entitled to a credit for any documented connection fee previously paid for service to the demolished building, but not to exceed the current applicable connection fee. "Similar" shall mean anticipated usage no greater than the previous user's 13-month average plus 10%. Any residential customer whose building is demolished may reconnect for the same type residential service without paying an additional connection fee. In all cases, the customer shall be responsible for any changes, such as a new, replaced, or relocated meter connection, service lines, or complete water tap for the reconnected service. 
(5)  (a)  If the request is for a new sewer connection or sewer service for a new customer or for additional sewer use for a restaurant operation at a location used as a restaurant within the 36 months prior to the application or for which a restaurant connection fee has been paid to the City since March 5, 1987, and no additional seating capacity is proposed for the location, then no new connection fee shall be required.

The foregoing house service fees or charges shall be in addition to the connection or tapping fee prescribed in subsection (A)(1) hereof, and petitioning property owners shall be required to pay such connection or tapping fee at and prior to the time of actual connection for sewer service to any such lateral sewer. Nonpetitioning owners of such properties, who later request or are required pursuant to the provisions of any ordinance or ordinances of the City, now or hereafter in force and effect, to make a connection for sewer service to any such lateral sewer, shall pay to the City, and the City shall collect, both said house service fees or charges and the connection or tapping fee prescribed in subsection (A)(1) hereof at the time the connection permit is issued. 
For the purposes of this subsection (B), where the width from property line to property line of any public street, thoroughfare or place is established or shown by or is described in or appears upon or from any recorded or unrecorded deed, other conveyance or any subdivision or other plat, conveying title to or an easement for any such public street, thoroughfare or place or dedicating or offering to dedicate to public use any such public street, thoroughfare or place, the width of such street, thoroughfare or public place shall be the width thereof as so established or shown by or described in or as appears upon or from such deed, conveyance or plat. Where the width of any such street, thoroughfare or place is not so established, shown or described, and does not so appear, then for such purposes the width of such street, thoroughfare or place shall be found, declared and established by the City Council of the City from such relevant evidence as may be available or be presented to the City Council, including but not limited to the apparent width of such street, thoroughfare or place, the location and extent of the paved, hard-surfaced or main traveled portion or portions thereof and of the shoulders, drainage ditches, curbs, gutters and sidewalks or sidewalk areas thereof, the location of telephone or electric poles and lines and of gas lines, sewers of any kind and other public utility distribution or service facilities thereon or therein, the visible indication or indications of the property lines on each side of such street, thoroughfare or place, and any other relevant facts and circumstances indicating the width of such street, thoroughfare or place between such property lines; and owners of property or properties abutting on any such street, thoroughfare or place or to be served by the lateral sewer proposed to be constructed and installed in such street, thoroughfare or place shall be afforded an opportunity to be present, and to offer evidence and to be heard as to the width of such street, thoroughfare or place, at a public hearing to be held by the City Council at a time and place to be fixed by the City Council and notice of the holding of which shall be published in the form and as directed by the City Council at least once in a newspaper published or of general circulation in the City at least ten days prior to the day of holding such hearing, before the City Council's finding, declaration and establishment of the width of such street, thoroughfare or place shall be final and binding upon such property owners; provided of course, however, that nothing herein provided shall prevent the determination of the width of any such street, thoroughfare or place by written agreement and consent of all the owners of such property or, as to any individual owner, by written agreement with and consent of such individual owner. 
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this subsection (B) and whenever for any reason the owners of properties abutting on a public street or streets or other public thoroughfare or thoroughfares or place or places within the corporate limits of the City are unwilling to file, or fail to file, a petition pursuant to the provision of this subsection (B), or shall file such petition which the City Council shall find to be unacceptable to it under said subsection (B), the City Council on its own initiative may by resolution authorize and direct the construction and installation of a lateral sanitary sewer in such street or streets, other public thoroughfare or thoroughfares or place or places to serve such properties abutting thereon and other properties if any which the City Council in said resolution may find can conveniently be served and shall direct to be served by such sewer, and the City Council in such resolution or by subsequent resolution shall, in accordance with the schedule of house service fees or charges hereinabove in this subsection (B) set forth, fix the amount of the house service fee or charge to be collected by the City from, and to be paid by, the owner or owners of each such property, or the successor or successors in title or interest of such owner or owners, as the case may be, in addition to the connection or tapping fee prescribed in subsection (A)(1) hereof, at and prior to actual connection for sewer service to such sewer, whether such owner or owners or successor or successors in title or interest request or are required pursuant to the provisions of any ordinance or ordinances of the City, now or hereafter in force and effect, to make connection for sewer service to such sewer. 
(C)  Where any lateral sanitary sewer has heretofore been, is now being, or is hereafter, constructed and installed in any public street or streets, road or roads, highway or highways, other thoroughfare or thoroughfares or place or places located outside the corporate limits of the City, no owner or owners of property or properties shall be permitted to make connection for sewer service to, or to receive sewer service through, any such lateral sanitary sewer without first paying to the City a house service fee or charge in the amount of $450.00 with respect to each such property to be connected to said sewer, which house service fee or charge shall be in addition to the connecting or tapping fee prescribed in subsection (A)(1) hereof, and which connection or tapping fee shall be paid by the property owner or owners prior to the time of actual connection for sewer service. 
(D)  Where lateral sewers and sanitary house service sewers to property served or to be served by any such lateral sewers are constructed and installed, in a subdivision at the cost of the subdivider or subdividers or developer or developers of such subdivision, owners of property applying for a permit for sanitary sewer service connection to such sewers shall be required to pay, and the City shall collect from such property owners, only the connection or tapping fee for each connection prescribed in subsection (A)(1) hereof. 
If any person obtaining a permit to connect with the sanitary sewer system of the City shall, within two years after the date of the issuance of such permit, fail to request the City to make the sewer connection covered thereby, and if in the meantime the applicable connection or tapping fee and the applicable house service or charge if any prescribed by this section shall be increased, then such permit shall be null, void and of no further force and effect, unless such person shall pay to the City such additional amount which, together with the amount already paid, will equal such increased connection or tapping fee and such increased house service fee or charge if any required to be paid. 
For the purposes of this section, a "lateral sewer" is defined to be a sanitary sewer constructed and installed in, under and along any public street, thoroughfare or place for the purpose of collecting and carrying sewage flowing therein from house service sewers, connecting properties abutting on such street, thoroughfare or place and other property if any served or to be served by such lateral sewer, to such lateral sewer; and a "house service sewer" is defined to be a sanitary sewer extending from the property line of any such property to a lateral sewer. 
Nothing herein provided shall be held or construed to obligate the City and its City Council upon petition of property owners or upon its own initiative or otherwise, to construct and install any sanitary lateral sewer in any public street, road, highway, thoroughfare or place, but whether or not such lateral sewer shall be constructed and installed shall be a matter to be determined in the sole discretion of the City Council. 
And nothing herein provided shall be held or construed in any wise or to any extent to modify, change, amend or otherwise affect the subdivision regulations or other rules and regulations of the City, now or hereafter from time to time in force and effect, relating to the installation and construction of water mains, lines and facilities and of sanitary sewers and other sewage facilities in any subdivision or subdivisions now being or hereafter developed, whether within or without the corporate limits of the City; but such subdivision regulations and such other rules and regulations, as now or hereafter from time to time in force and effect, shall govern and be applicable to the installation and construction of such mains, lines and facilities and of such sanitary sewers and other sanitary sewage facilities in such subdivisions, including the amount or amounts to be contributed and paid by the developer or developers of such subdivisions towards, or for the payment of, the costs of such installation and construction. 
(E)  Notwithstanding subsections (B) and (C) of this section, the same shall not be held or construed in any wise or to any extent to affect or to apply to any sanitary sewer heretofore or hereafter installed and constructed in any subdivision and paid for in whole or in part by the developer of such subdivision.

Section 33-51 - Reduction in charges for water excluded from sewerage system. 
(A)  In the event that it is established to the satisfaction of the Department that all or a portion of the water consumed does not and cannot enter the public sanitary sewerage system, then such water not reaching the system may be excluded from the computation of the charge for sewerage service. In such event the Department shall require the installation of an additional meter at the customer's or interested party's expense in such a manner as to measure the quantity of water actually excluded from the public sanitary sewerage system. All outlets for such water shall be consolidated and measured by one single meter at a location satisfactory to the Department. All repairs thereto shall be made at the expense of the owner or interested party. 
(B)  Eligibility. 
(1)  Customers are eligible for the adjustment of monthly sewer charges in only the following circumstances: 
(a)  the average amount of water diverted by an industry equals a minimum of 112,500 gallons per month for a 12-month period; or, 
(b)  the customer is a municipal golf course; or, 
(c)  customers are eligible for the adjustment of monthly sewer charges in only the following circumstances: the customer is a residential or commercial customer who uses extra water for lawn or garden irrigation purposes and satisfies the requirements herein. The reduction period will be only for the months of April, May, June, July, August, September and October. If the consumption for a said month exceeds 120% of the monthly winter average calculated by averaging the months of November through March less the high and the low months, the customer shall not be charged sewer charges on the excess. If the customer does not have a consumption for winter average calculation as set forth above herein, the consumption average for the customer's category plus 20% shall be used and 6,750 gallons shall be used as an average for residential applicants; or 
(d)  the commercial or residential customer has and utilizes a separate water meter for an irrigation system. 
(e)  any "water only" customer who has public sewer available (within 200 ft. of the property line) shall be entitled to the credit provided in (c) above during only the months of June, July, August and September. 
For the purpose of this section, "commercial" is defined as nonresidential, except for multifamily, and non-industrial business enterprises. 
(C)  In the event that the Department finds it is not practical to measure the flow of diverted water, the Director, at its discretion, approve some other manner of computing or estimating the amount of water diverted from the public sanitary sewerage system. 
(D)  Customers requesting consideration from a reduction in sewerage service charges because of water excluded from the public sanitary sewerage system shall make written application to the Department for such consideration, giving their name, address, account number and supporting data fully describing all sources of water, as well as the disposition of water alleged not to be entering the public sanitary sewerage system. The application shall be accompanied by a sketch to approximate scale showing the plan of the property, water distribution system, sewer, layout, points of connection to the sewer system, existing meters and proposed meter and the scheme proposed for determining the quantity of water entering the public sanitary sewerage system and that flow excluded from the sanitary sewerage system. 
(E)  In the event the customer modifies the system without the prior written consent and approval of the Department, the Department may in its discretion permanently terminate the customer's right to the exclusion provided for in this section. In like manner, if the Department determines that the customer has tampered with the meters or bypassed the meters, or in any way abused the right granted under this section, the Department may in its discretion permanently terminate the customer's right for a reduction in charges provided for in this section. 
(F)  By making such application the applicant hereby consents to the City making inspections without prior notice.

Section 33-52 - Disputed bill or action. 
(A)  Any customer who disputes the accuracy of the bill or any action of the Water Resources Department under the terms and provisions of this article shall be entitled to review of the bill or action, provided the request for a hearing is made on or before the due date of the disputed bill. 
(B)  Hearings on disputed bills or actions of the Department under this article will be held by appointment at the offices of the Department between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. any business day. 
(C)  A customer requesting a hearing has the right to examine the records of the Department pertaining to that customer's service. 
(D)  A customer requesting a hearing has the right to have a representative at the hearing, to testify and to present witnesses. 
(E)  Hearings will be conducted by an authorized counselor duly appointed by the Department. The authorized counselor will hear the evidence and render a decision. 
(F)  If the customer believes the decision of the counselor is in error and requests an appeal hearing in writing by noon of the third business day next following, or if the counselor desires to refer the matter to a higher level, a hearing will be conducted by the Director of the Department. The Director will hear the evidence and render a decision. If the customer is still not satisfied with the decision, the customer may appear before the Water Resources Board at a regular monthly Board meeting, who will hear the evidence and render a final decision, provided a written appeal is filed by noon of the third business day next following. 
(G)  The customer's service will not be terminated until an appropriate decision is reached. 
(H)  The customer has the right to a post termination of service hearing under the above procedures if there was no hearing before termination, if the customer requests such post termination of service hearing by noon of the third business day following such termination. 
(I)  A copy of the above hearing appeal procedures will be posted in the office of the Department at the immediate location where customers pay bills.

Section 33-103 - Declaration of water shortage emergency by Mayor. 
(A)  The Mayor may declare a water shortage emergency irrespective of whether the City water supply has reached water shortage emergency level 1 or 2. The Mayor may declare an end to a water shortage emergency. 
(B)  Water shortage emergency level 1 is when the water level in Walter Hill Reservoir drops more than two feet below the dam crest, or when the water level supply from Percy Priest Lake is interrupted or not available, or whenever the water level in two or more of the distribution reservoirs cannot be brought above the two-thirds full mark in a 48-hour period. When the water supply reaches water shortage emergency level 1, the Mayor, upon the recommendation of the Director of the Water Resources Department, may declare any or all of the uses of water identified as nonessential use category 1 and said prohibition shall remain in full force and effect until the next meeting of the City Council. The list of nonessential uses may be increased or decreased pending the next meeting of the City Council. 
(C)  Water shortage emergency level 2 is when water level in the Walter Hill Reservoir drops more than five feet below the crest of the dam, or when the water supply from Percy Priest Lake is interrupted or not available, or the water level in two or more of the distribution reservoirs cannot be brought above the one-quarter full mark within a 48-hour period. If water shortage emergency level 2 is reached, the Mayor, upon recommendation of the Director of the Department, may declare any or all of the nonessential uses provided for in this article as being prohibited and the same shall remain in full force and effect until the next meeting of the City Council. The Mayor may increase or decrease the number of prohibited nonessential uses pending the next meeting of the City Council. 
(Ord. No. 80-21 § 1, 07-31-80; Ord. No. 01-O-72 § 2, 10-18-01; Ord. No. 18-O-47 , § 7, 8-16-18) 
Section 33-104 - Nonessential uses during water shortage emergency. 
(A)  Declaration by Mayor. The Mayor, in the Mayor's discretion, may declare a water shortage emergency and request voluntary conservation of water. 
(B)  Nonessential use category 1. The following uses are declared to be nonessential uses, category 1: 
(1)  Washing sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, tennis courts, patios or other exterior paved areas, except by the City for the public safety. 
(2)  Filling or refilling a swimming pool. 
(3)  Noncommercial washing of privately owned motor vehicles, trailers and boats.

If the facility was not operating the previous year, an assumed amount shall be computed by the City from its records. This subsection shall not apply to any facility that recycles water in a manner satisfactory to the Water Resources Department and has received written approval and exemption from this subsection. 
(3)  Any nonresidential use in excess of 70% of the amount used by the customer during the corresponding billing period for the previous year. If the customer was not operating the previous year, an assumed amount shall be computed by the City from its records. The Director of the Department, with the concurrence of the City Manager, may increase the percentage for any connection use or customer if it is determined that such increase is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare or to spread equitably among the water users of the City the burden imposed by the shortage in the City's water supply. 
(D)  Nonessential use category 3. The following uses are declared to be nonessential uses, category 3: 
(1)  Schools and industry. Discretion may be used in selecting schools and industries to be closed, based upon the amount of water used and anticipated to be saved by closing same. Industries which use a negligible amount of water should not be closed. Industries with a large process of water needs may contribute substantially to the conservation effort by closing same. Specifically, the guidelines for closing schools and industry shall be in accordance with the foregoing and summarized as follows: 
(a)  close only those customers where a significant water saving would be involved; 
(b)  try to arrange a long weekend shut down or a shortened work week so that a minimum disruption would result; and, 
(c)  if possible, employ a selective rotation of industry shut down so that no one industry has to bear the major part of the conservation effort. 
(2)  Use in any dwelling or separate residential unit in excess of 50 gallons per day for each permanent resident thereof. Each customer of the City shall on the request of the Director of the Department certify in writing under penalty of perjury the number of permanent residents of each dwelling or separate residential unit billed to the customer.

Section 33-301 - Conditions for repurified water service. 
(A)  Compliance with regulations. Repurified water is subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations to protect the safety of the public and the integrity of both the potable and repurified water systems. Customer agrees to comply with any federal, state and local laws, regulations and standards that may apply the customer's use of repurified water. Such laws, regulations and standards may include: 
(1)  requirements and restrictions governing the use of repurified water; 
(2)  application methods that reasonably preclude certain kinds of human contact with repurified water; 
(3)  controlled access to the repurified water, its delivery system, storage and use; 
(4)  requirements to prevent repurified water from standing on open access areas during normal periods of use; 
(5)  requirements to prevent repurified water from coming into contact with drinking fountains, water coolers or eating areas; and, 
(6)  requirements to identify certain components of the delivery system, or to provide public notice or signage that repurified water is used on the customer's premises. 
(B)  Compliance with agreement. A repurified water customer agreement establishes the terms and conditions that apply to the ultimate consumer of the City's repurified water. No repurified water service of the City may be connected or served until the following conditions are met: 
(1)  a complete agreement and application for repurified water is executed by the owner of the property and, if different from the owner, the user; 
(2)  MWSD and the customer agree on the use site; MWSD agrees to deliver repurified water to a meter at the customer's property line at the designated use site and the customer agrees that repurified water will be stored and/or used exclusively at the designated use site; 
(3)  customer may not resell repurified water, and is prohibited from conveying repurified water delivered under this agreement to any other premises or location not specified in the application; 
(4)  the MWSD repurified water distribution system terminates at the meter. The Customer is solely responsible for any on site costs arising from the construction, maintenance or operation of the on site portion of the system; and, 
(5)  credit toward usage rates may be given for initial site capital costs in accordance with the schedule of rates, fees and charges established by the City Council. 
(C)  Color coding. The use of color code Pantone Purple 522C is required for all public repurified water lines, valves and outlets and appurtenances, and is strongly recommended for distribution and application facilities located on private properties. If distribution and application facilities located on private property are not color coded Pantone Purple 522C, they must be labeled in a MWSD approved manner which adequately identifies the water as non-potable. 
(D)  Hose bibs. Customer specifically agrees not to install hose bibs, except as allowed by City policy, on any component of the repurified water delivery system. 
(E)  Signage. Customer is responsible for posting and maintaining signs that will inform the public that repurified water is being used on the customer's premises. Such signage shall conform to the policies of the City. Customer may also be responsible for posting other signage that may be required by the State of Tennessee. 
(F)  Cross-connection control. Repurified water is designated as a non-potable water supply. Since it is virtually impossible to distinguish repurified water from drinking water by sight or scent, it is important to maintain complete separation of the repurified water and potable water systems. To accomplish this goal, the provisions of the cross connection control program as outlined in Chapter 33, Article II, Sections 33-18 through 33-22 shall apply. At a minimum, a reduced pressure backflow prevention device shall be required on the potable water supply for the site served with repurified water. Cross connection protection may be required on the repurified system. MWSD shall determine the required level of protection based on the potential risk. 
(G)  Inspection. Customer agrees that the City or any other public agency with the authority to verify compliance with the repurified water use regulation may inspect the customer's premises to verify compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Customer further acknowledges the responsibility and obligation to inform MWSD of certain activities relating to the construction, maintenance and operation of its private repurified water system, including, but not necessarily limited to, materials, construction or modification, testing, violations and emergency situations. 
(H)  Plans. Customer acknowledges the responsibility to maintain a copy of the on site repurified water system plans at the premises where the water is being used. 
(I)  Potential Disruption of Service. Customer accepts the possibility that MWSD may be required to disrupt repurified water service or to reduce pressure due to emergency conditions, peak demands, or planned system maintenance. MWSD will not be responsible for any damage or loss that may be sustained because of any interruption of service. 
(J)  Emergency terminations. When there is an unforeseen emergency, MWSD may terminate delivery of repurified water without notice. When notice of an emergency is given, customer shall reduce or cease usage of repurified water. 
(K)  Cessation or reduction in use. In order to accommodate peak demands or planned maintenance, MWSD shall provide the customer with 24-hour notice of the need to cease or reduce repurified water usage. Upon receipt of such notice, customer shall comply with the notice. 
(L)  Transfer of property. Customer agrees that all leases of the premises subject to the agreement for repurified water service shall be in writing and must be made expressly subject to the agreement. Should the customer sell or otherwise transfer ownership or control of the premises described herein to a third party, MWSD shall not be obligated to provide repurified water to any subsequent owner or customer unless such sale or disposal incorporates the agreement by reference, and makes any successors and assigns expressly subject to the agreement. If such third party disposition does not include such provisions, customer will close its account with MWSD and pay any fees or charges incurred by customer before the disposition of the property is effective. 
(M)  Termination of service. Customer acknowledges that potable water, repurified water and sewer service may be discontinued for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement for repurified water service, including, but not limited to, failure to pay for potable water, repurified water or sewer services provided by MWSD. 
(Ord. No. 05-O-55 § 1, 09-15-05) 
Section 33-302 - Discontinuance of service for failure to pay bill. 
If any person shall fail to pay their bill for potable water, repurified water or sewer service by the due date shown on such bill, MWSD may cut off and disconnect repurified water from the premises of the person owning or controlling the property to which such bill relates, and water shall remain cut off and disconnected from such premises until bill shall be paid. 
If the water shall be so cut off or disconnected, the same rules that apply for disconnection and reconnection of potable water as set forth in § 33-3 shall apply. 
If any check is returned by any bank for any reason, there shall be a service charge as set forth in § 33-3. If service is discontinued due to failure by the customer to make satisfactory restitution for said check, the reconnection fee described in the preceding paragraph shall apply. 
MWSD shall not be liable for any damages resulting from discontinuance of service for failure to pay bill, or from delay in reconnection of service. 
(Ord. No. 05-O-55 § 1, 09-15-05) 
Section 33-303 - Tapping mains without permission; using unmetered water; tampering with meters, etc.; interfering with installation, operation, etc., of meter. 
It shall be unlawful for any person: 
(A)  To make a tap or connection with any repurified water main of the City or with any pipe connected with any such repurified water main, without first obtaining the consent of MWSD; 
(B)  To take, use or consume any repurified water from any such water main or any pipe connected with any such repurified water main, unless such repurified water is regularly metered by a water meter installed, or the installation of which has been approved, by MWSD; 
(C)  To tamper in any manner with any such meter, including all fittings and fixtures thereon and connection thereto, or in any respect with the regularly approved installation of same; or, 
(D)  By the installation or use of any pipe, by-pass, cut-off or other device or by other means whatsoever, to interfere in any manner with the approved installation of any such meter or with the normal operation of any such meter or with the normal registration thereon and thereby of the quantity of water consumed. 
(Ord. No. 05-O-55 § 1, 09-15-05) 
Section 33-304 - Penalty. 
Any person who shall violate or fail to comply with any provision of this chapter shall be penalized as provided in Code § 1-8. 
In addition, whenever it has been determined that an illegal connection has been made, MWSD shall charge the owner of the property any costs associated with removing the connection.

Chapter 36 - CABLE COMMUNICATIONS 

Section 36-1 - General provisions. 
(A)  Title. This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "City Cable Communications Chapter." 
(B)  Effective date. This Chapter shall be and become effective on April 25, 2003, and such date shall be referred to as the effective date of this Chapter. 
(C)  Findings and purpose. The City of Murfreesboro, Tennessee ("City") finds that the further development of cable communications may result in great benefits for the people of the City. The City further finds that public rights-of-way to be used by a franchisee for the operation of a cable system are valuable public property acquired and maintained by the State and the City. The City further finds that the grant of a franchise to use public rights-of-way is a valuable property right without which a franchisee would be required to invest substantial capital. 
(1)  Cable technology is rapidly changing, and cable plays an important role as part of the City's basic infrastructure. Cable communications systems permanently occupy and extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rights-of-way, in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them. The City finds that public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the City or such persons as the City so designates to protect the public and to ensure that any cable communications franchise granted is operated in the public interest. 
(2)  Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the City's residents, but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services. 
(3)  In light of the foregoing, the following goals, among others, underlie the provisions set forth in this Chapter: 
(a)  Cable service should be available to as many City residents as possible. 
(b)  A cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of the City. 
(c)  A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so as to maximize the integration of new technology into existing system facilities. 
(d)  A cable system should be responsive to the cable-related needs and interests of the City and its residents and should promote the widest possible diversity of cable services to the public. 
(e)  A cable operator should pay fair and reasonable compensation to the City for the use of local public rights-of-way. 
(4)  The City intends that all provisions set forth in this Chapter be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes, and that any Franchise issued pursuant to this Chapter be construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof. 
(D)  Delegation of powers. To the extent permitted by law, the City Council may delegate the performance of any act, duty, or obligation, or the exercise of any power, under this Chapter to any City employee, officer, commission, department or agency.

Franchise fee payments covering periods in which any such aggregated bill is used shall be accompanied by an explanation of such allocation and the amounts so allocated. Any such allocation may be addressed in any audit conducted pursuant to this Chapter. If cable modem service and the revenues derived therefrom may be legally included in gross revenues for the purpose of assessing a franchise fee, City may immediately commence, though on a reasonable implementation schedule, the assessment of a franchise fee on cable modem service to the maximum amount allowable by applicable law, and the franchisee shall agree to pay such franchise fee on cable modem service revenues, in such event.

Section 36-3 - Grant of franchise. 
(A)  Grant. 
(1)  The City may grant one or more cable franchises. 
(2)  This Chapter shall not be considered a contract between the City and a franchisee such that the City would be prohibited from amending any provision hereof. 
(3)  No person may construct or operate a cable system in the City without a franchise granted by the City. No person may be granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement with the City pursuant to this Chapter. 
(B)  Term of franchise. No franchise shall be granted for a period of more than 15 years, except that a franchisee may apply at any time for renewal, extension or modification pursuant to applicable law. 
(C)  Franchise characteristics. 
(1)  A franchise authorizes use of public rights-of-way for installing cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, and other facilities and devices necessary and appurtenant to the operation of a cable system within a franchise area, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize a franchisee to provide service to, or install a cable system on, private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible easements pursuant to Section 621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 541(a)(2) and common law), or to use publicly or privately owned conduits without a separate agreement with the owners. 
(2)  A franchise is non-exclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems within the City; except as may be set forth in such franchise affect the City's right to authorize use of public rights-of-way by other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as it determines appropriate; or except as may be set forth in such franchise, affect the City's right to itself construct, operate, or maintain a cable system, in accordance with applicable state law. 
(3)  All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to (without limitation) the City's use and any prior lawful occupancy of the public rights-of-way. 
(4)  The City reserves the right to the approval of where a franchisee's facilities are to be placed within the public rights-of-way and to resolve any disputes in a competitively neutral manner. 
(D)  Franchisee subject to other laws, Police Power. 
(1)  A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. A franchisee shall at all times be subject to the lawful exercise of the police power of the City. Except to the extent of a conflict or as expressly set forth therein, nothing in a franchise agreement shall be deemed to waive the requirements of codes and ordinances of the City generally applicable to similarly situated persons regarding permits, zoning, fees to be paid, or manner of construction, installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of system equipment. 
(2)  Subject to any otherwise applicable statutes of limitations, no course of dealing between a franchisee and the City, or any delay on the part of the City in exercising any rights hereunder, or any acquiescence by the City in the actions of a franchisee that are in contravention of such rights (except to the extent such rights are expressly waived by the City) shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the City. 
(3)  The City may, from time to time, issue such reasonable generally applicable rules and regulations concerning cable systems as are consistent with applicable law, so long as such rules or regulations do not limit or interfere with franchisee's rights under a franchise agreement. 
(4)  Subject to federal law or regulation, a franchise agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee. 
(E)  Acts at franchisee's expense. Any act that a franchisee is or may be required to perform under this Chapter, a franchise agreement, or applicable law shall be performed at the franchisee's expense, unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Chapter, the franchise agreement, or applicable law. 
(F)  Eminent Domain. Nothing herein shall be deemed or be construed to impair or affect, in any way or to any extent, the City's rights of eminent domain to the extent to which they may apply to any public utility or cable system. 
(Ord. No. 03-O-10 § 4, 04-10-03) 
Section 36-4 - Applications for initial grant or modification of franchise. 
(A)  Application required. 
(1)  A written application shall be filed with the City for the grant of an initial franchise or modification of a franchise agreement pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 545. 
(2)  To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application shall be submitted together with 12 copies. The application must be accompanied by any required application filing fee, conform to any applicable request for proposals, and contain all required information. All applications shall include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of all applicants with respect to the application. 
(3)  All applications accepted for filing shall be made available by the City for public inspection. 
(B)  Application for grant of an initial franchise. 
(1)  A Person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an application containing the information required in § 36-4(C) to the Cable Commission. Upon receipt of such an application, the Commission may either (a) evaluate the application pursuant to § 36-4(B)(4), conducting such investigations as it deems necessary; or (b) issue a Request for Proposals ("RFP"), after conducting a proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and interests of the community. Any such RFP shall be mailed to the Person submitting the initial application, which triggered the RFP and made available to any other interested party. The RFP may contain a proposed franchise agreement. 
(2)  An applicant shall respond to an RFP by filing an application with the Commission within the time directed by the City, providing the information and material set forth in § 36-4(C). The procedures, instructions, and requirements set forth in the RFP shall be followed by each applicant. Any applicant that has already filed materials pursuant to subsection 36-4(B)(3) herein need not re-file the same materials with its RFP response, but must amplify its application to include any additional or different materials required by the RFP. The Commission or its designee may seek additional information from any applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such information. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of § 36-4(B)(1) and (2), above, a person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited application containing the information required in § 36-4(C) and requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to § 36-4(B)(4). Prior to evaluating that application, the Commission shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, such investigations as are necessary to determine whether the application satisfies the standards set forth in § 36-4(B)(4) and may seek additional applications by RFP or otherwise in accordance with this Chapter. 
(4)  In evaluating an application for an initial franchise, the Commission shall consider, among other things, the following factors: 
(a)  The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise for the City; 
(b)  Whether the quality of the applicant's proposed service is reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities proposed to be served; 
(c)  Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to provide cable service; 
(d)  Whether the application satisfies the minimum requirements established by the City and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests; 
(e)  Whether, to the extent not considered under § 36-4(B)(4)(d), the applicant will provide adequate educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or other support; 
(f)  Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way that would be used by the cable system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rights-of-way; the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of the applicant to meet the cable-related needs and interests of the community; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing applications; 
(g)  What effects a grant of the application may have on competition in the delivery of cable service in the City; 
(h)  Whether the applicant is capable of and willing to accept franchise terms and conditions no more favorable nor less burdensome than those imposed on current franchisee(s); and, 
(i)  Those factors set forth in § 7-59-202 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, as same may be amended from time to time. 
(5)  After evaluating a fully completed application, including all additional information requested by the City, the Commission shall transmit recommendations to the City Council. 
(6)  If the Council finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors set forth in § 36-4(B)(4), and any other relevant factors permitted by law to be considered, and subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise agreement, it shall issue a franchise, after complying with any applicable public hearing requirements. If the Council denies a request for a franchise, it will issue a written decision explaining in reasonable detail why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the Council shall hold at least one public hearing and implement procedures under which comments from the public on an application may be received. The Council also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based on its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject any application that is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP. This Chapter is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any applicant or existing franchisee any additional standing than that which it may otherwise have under applicable law to challenge the denial of its application or the issuance of a franchise to another. 
(C)  Contents of application. An application or RFP for the grant of an initial franchise shall require, and any such application shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 
(1)  Name and address of the applicant and identification of the ownership and control of the applicant, including: the names and addresses of the ten largest holders of an ownership interest in the applicant and affiliates of the applicant, and all persons with 5% or more ownership interest in the applicant and its affiliates; the persons who control the applicant and its affiliates; all officers and directors of the applicant and its affiliates; and any other business affiliation and cable system ownership interest of each named person.

(e)  The applicant is willing to enter into a franchise agreement, to pay required fees, and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those related to the construction, operation or repair of its facilities, and has not entered into any agreement which would prevent the applicant from doing so. 
(f)  The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time during the ten years preceding the submission of the application, the applicant was convicted of any act or omission of such character that in the sole reasonable opinion of the City, the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully with the City and the subscribers of the cable system, or to substantially comply with its lawful obligations under applicable law, including acts of moral turpitude, and obligations under consumer protection laws and laws prohibiting anticompetitive acts, fraud, racketeering, or other similar conduct. 
(g)  The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files materially misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide. 
(h)  The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if an elected official of the City holds a controlling interest in the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by law, the City shall provide an opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of the cable systems. 
(4)  A demonstration of the financial qualifications of the applicant, including at least the following: 
(a)  The applicant's proposed rate structure, including projected charges for each service tier, installation, converters and all other proposed equipment or services for the ensuing five years.

(E)  Application for Modification of a Franchise. 
(1)  An application from a franchisee for modification of a franchise agreement shall include, at minimum, the following information:

(H)  Acceptance of franchise. Following approval by the Council, any franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter, and the rights, privileges and authority granted by a franchise agreement, shall take effect and be in force from and after the first date on which both the franchisee and the City have accepted and signed the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 03-O-10 § 4, 04-10-03) 
Section 36-5 - Design and construction. 
(A)  System construction schedule. Every franchise agreement shall specify a construction schedule, if any, that will apply to any required construction, upgrade, or rebuild of a cable system or institutional network. Such schedule shall provide for prompt completion of the construction, upgrade or rebuild, considering the amount and type of work required, and shall show areas within the franchise area that will be affected. 
(B)  Construction procedures. 
(1)  A franchisee shall construct its cable system subject to the lawful supervision of the City or its designees, and in strict compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. In addition, the construction of cable systems shall be performed in a manner consistent with industry standards. Persons engaged in the construction of cable systems shall exercise reasonable care in the performance of all their activities, and use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the public or to property. 
(2)  Unless otherwise provided in a franchise, every system, and all parts thereof, shall be subject to the right of periodic inspection and testing by the City to determine compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, a franchise agreement and other applicable law. The City shall have the right, upon request, to be notified and to be present when a system is tested by a franchisee. Each franchisee shall respond to requests for information regarding its system and its plans for the system as the City may from time to time issue, including requests for information regarding its plans for construction, operation, and repair, and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed, operated or repaired. 
(3)  No construction, reconstruction, repair or relocation of a cable system or any part thereof within the public rights-of-way shall be commenced until all applicable written permits have been properly filed for and obtained from the proper City officials, and required permit and associated fees are paid. In any permit so issued, the City may impose, as a condition of the granting of the permit, such reasonable and generally applicable conditions and regulations as may be necessary to the management of the public rights-of-way, including, by way of example and not limitation, conditions and regulations for the purpose of protecting any structures in the public rights-of-way, for the proper restoration of such public rights-of-way and structures, and for the protection of the City, the public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. A franchisee may immediately begin emergency construction or emergency repairs without a written permit; provided that the franchisee notifies the City of such construction or repairs no later than the next business day following the commencement of the construction or repair work, and then applies for all necessary permits in accordance with applicable procedures. The notice provided to the City shall clearly identify the location of the emergency work, and explain why such work was necessary. 
(4)  Each franchisee that places facilities underground shall be a member of the Tennessee One Call Notification System or its successor and shall field mark the locations of its underground facilities upon request. Throughout the term of a franchise, a franchisee shall identify the location of its facilities for the City upon request at no charge to the City unless the City's request is due to City's building a competitive cable system or the request is made for the benefit of another franchisee or licensee, in which case City or other franchisee or licensee shall pay. 
(5)  Cable system operators shall follow City requirements for placement of facilities in public rights-of-way, including specific location of facilities in the public rights-of-way, and shall in any event install facilities in a manner that minimizes interference with the use of the public rights-of-way by others, including others that may be installing cable systems, other communications facilities or utilities. To the extent within City's lawful exercise of its police power, with respect to a particular construction, repair or maintenance project, the City may establish reasonable conditions on the time, place and manner in which work is done; may deny access if the operator is not willing to comply with the City's reasonable requirements; may require the removal of, upon reasonable notice, any facility that is not installed in compliance with the requirements established by the City, or which is installed without prior City approval of the time, place or manner of installation, and charge the operator for all the costs associated with removal; and may require a person using the public rights-of-way to cooperate with others to minimize adverse impacts on the public rights-of-way through joint trenching and other arrangements. The City shall have the right to inspect all facilities being placed underground before they are covered. 
(6)  Notwithstanding any grant to use public rights-of-way, no public right-of-way shall be used by a franchisee if the City reasonably determines that such use is inconsistent with the terms, conditions or provisions by which such public right-of-way was created or dedicated, or with the present use of the public right-of-way. 
(7)  Upon order of the City, all work which does not comply with a permit, the material portions of approved plans or specifications for the work, or the requirements of this Chapter, a franchise agreement or applicable law, shall be promptly removed by a franchisee at its expense. 
(C)  Use of public property. 
(1)  Should the grades or lines of the public rights-of-way that the franchisee is authorized by a franchise to use and occupy be changed at any time during the term of a franchise, the franchisee shall, if necessary, relocate or change its system, at its own cost and expense, so as to conform with the new grades or lines. 
(2)  Any alteration to any water and sewage mains or lines, to any drainage system or to any structures in the public rights-of-way, on public property, or on private property, which alteration is required on account of the presence of a franchisee's system in the public rights-of-way or on such public or private property, shall be made at no cost to City. During any work of constructing, operating or maintaining of a system, the franchisee shall also protect any and all existing structures belonging to the City and any other person. The City reserves its lawful authority to prescribe the manner in which a franchisee shall perform any such work performed within the public rights-of-way or on City property. 
(3)  All public rights-of-way, public property, or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation or repair of a cable system shall be promptly repaired, as specified in a franchise agreement, at the sole expense of the franchisee that disturbed or damaged the public rights-of-way, public property or private property. 
(D)  Interference with public project; relocation of facilities. 
(1)  Nothing in this Chapter or any franchise agreement shall be in preference or hindrance to the right of the City, the City Council or any board, authority, commission or public service corporation to perform or carry on any public works or public improvements of any description. Should a franchisee's system in any way interfere with the construction, maintenance or repair of any public works or public improvements other than a cable television system in competition with franchisee, the franchisee shall, at no cost to City, protect or relocate its system, or part thereof, as directed by City, the Council, the Cable Television Coordinator or any City official, board, authority, or commission or public service corporation. 
(2)  If any person that is authorized to place facilities in the public rights-of-way requests a franchisee to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove or relocate its facilities to accommodate the construction, operation or repair of the facilities of such other person, the franchisee shall, after 30 days' advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested. If the requested action is necessary to address an emergency that, in the reasonable opinion of the City, might affect the public health, safety or welfare, then the franchisee shall take immediate action upon receipt of notice of the request to complete the requested action at no charge to the City. Unless the matter is governed by a valid contract, a local ordinance, regulation or policy, or a state or federal law or regulation, or in other cases where the system that is being requested to move was not properly installed, the reasonable cost of the same shall be borne by the party requesting the protection, support, temporary disconnection, removal or relocation and performed at the cost of the entity requesting such action. 
(3)  A franchisee shall, at the request of any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the temporary or permanent moving of buildings, structures, equipment of whatever nature, or other objects. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and a franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance, except in the case where the requesting person is the City, in which case no payment shall be required, unless the City request directly relates to a City owned municipal cable system, in which case the City shall pay the expenses incurred by franchisee as a result of the City request. A franchisee shall not be given less than five business days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(E)  Quality of service. 
(1)  To the extent permitted by law, a franchisee's cable system within the franchise area in the City shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 76.601, et seq. or successor applicable federal technical standards. 
(2)  A franchisee shall perform, at its sole cost, all tests necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of a franchise agreement and other technical and performance standards established by law. Unless a franchise agreement or applicable law provides otherwise, all tests shall be conducted in accordance with federal rules. A written report of test results shall be filed with the City within seven days of a written request by the City. If a location fails to meet technical or performance specifications, a franchisee, without requirement of additional notice or request from the City, shall promptly take corrective action, retest the location and advise the City of the action taken and the results achieved. 
(F)  Permits. A franchisee shall be required to obtain permits for the installation of its facilities in the public rights-of-way, as required by any generally applicable provision of the Code. 
(Ord. No. 03-O-10 § 4, 04-10-03) 
Section 36-6 - Consumer protection. 
(A)  General provisions. This § 36-6 sets forth customer service standards that a franchisee must satisfy. In addition, a franchisee shall at all times satisfy any additional or stricter requirements established by FCC regulations, or other applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation, as the same may be amended from time to time. 
(1)  Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent or prohibit: 
(a)  the City and a franchisee from agreeing in a franchise agreement to customer service requirements that exceed the standards set forth in this Chapter; 
(b)  the City from enforcing, through the end of a franchise term, pre-existing customer service requirements that differ from the standards set forth in this Chapter and are contained in current franchise agreements; 
(c)  the City from enacting or enforcing any generally applicable customer service or consumer protection laws or regulations; 
(d)  the establishment or enforcement of any City law or regulation concerning customer service that imposes customer service requirements that exceed, or address matters not addressed by, the standards set forth in this Chapter, or federal or state law; or 
(e)  the City from waiving, for good cause, requirements established in this § 36-6. 
(2)  Nothing in this Chapter in any way relieves a franchisee of its obligation to comply with other applicable consumer protection laws and its franchise agreement. 
(B)  Installations, connections, and other franchisee services. 
(1)  Standard installations. Except as federal rate regulations or a franchise agreement may otherwise permit, a franchisee shall not assess a subscriber any cost other than a standard installation charge for service drops of 125 feet or less from a franchisee's existing distribution plant, for a single outlet, unless the franchisee demonstrates to the City's satisfaction that extraordinary circumstances justify a higher charge. 
(2)  Non-standard installations. Except as applicable law or a franchise agreement may otherwise require, where a drop exceeds 125 feet in length from a franchisee's existing distribution plant, a franchisee may charge a subscriber for franchisee's actual costs associated with installing the drop beyond such 125 feet. The subscriber's preference as to the point of entry into the residence shall be observed whenever reasonably feasible. The franchisee shall use due care in the process of Installation and shall repair any damage to the subscriber's property caused by said Installation. Such restoration shall be undertaken as soon as reasonably practical after the damage is incurred and shall be completed within no more than 30 days after the damage is incurred. 
(3)  Location of drops. In locations where the franchisee's system must be underground, drops must be placed underground as well, unless a franchisee or subscriber successfully petitions the City for an exception hereto. Except as federal law may otherwise require, in any area where a franchisee would be entitled to install a drop above-ground, the franchisee will provide the homeowner the option to have the drop installed underground if requested, but may charge the homeowner the difference between the actual cost of the above-ground Installation and the actual cost of the underground Installation. 
(4)  Time for extension. Where a franchisee is required under the terms of its franchise agreement to provide service to a person, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement it must provide such service (i) within seven business days of an order being placed with the franchisee if such person resides no further than 125 feet from the franchisee's distribution system; (ii) within 90 business days if the person resides more than 125 feet from the franchisee's distribution system, but the distribution system need not be extended for one-quarter mile or more to provide service; and (iii) within six months if an extension of the distribution system for one-half mile or more is required. 
(5)  Deposits. A franchisee may require a reasonable, non-discriminatory deposit on equipment provided to subscribers, in addition to any allowable monthly rental fees. Any subscriber deposit required by a franchisee shall bear interest in accordance with applicable law or at the going rate, which shall be not less than the prime rate of the bank being used by the City for the conduct of ordinary business. Unless otherwise agreed to between a subscriber and a franchisee, all deposits, with interest, shall be returned to the subscriber within 60 days after the subscriber has ceased leasing such equipment or when equipment is returned at time of disconnection of service, whichever is sooner. 
(6)  Antennas and antenna switches. A franchisee shall adhere to FCC regulations regarding antenna switches. A franchisee shall not, as a condition to providing cable service, require any subscriber or potential subscriber to remove any existing antenna structures for the receipt of over-the-air television signals. 
(C)  Telephone and office availability. 
(1)  Unless otherwise provided in a franchise, a franchisee shall maintain an office at a geographically convenient location that shall be open at least during normal business hours to allow subscribers to request service, pay bills, and conduct other cable-related business. Each franchisee shall perform service calls, installations and disconnects during at least normal business hours, provided that a franchisee shall be available to respond to outages 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
(2)  Each franchisee shall establish a publicly listed, local or toll free telephone number. Trained customer service representatives shall be available to respond to customer calls at least during normal business hours for the purpose of receiving requests for service, inquiries and complaints from subscribers; after normal business hours franchisee may answer by a service or an automated response system, including an answering machine. Inquiries received after normal business hours must be responded to by a trained representative within the next business day. 
(3)  Under normal operating conditions, telephone answering time shall not exceed 30 seconds, and the time to transfer a call to a customer service representative (including hold time) shall not exceed an additional 30 seconds. This standard shall be met at least 90% of the time, measured quarterly. Under normal operating conditions a subscriber will receive a busy signal less than 3% of the time. Thirty days after the end of each calendar quarter, a franchisee shall upon request supply the City with statistical data to verify it has met the standards set forth herein. 
(4)  A franchisee shall hire sufficient staff so that it can adequately respond to customer inquiries, complaints, and requests for service in its office, over the telephone, and at the subscriber's residence. 
(D)  Scheduling and completing service. Under normal operating conditions, each of the following standards shall be met by all franchisees at least 90% of the time, as measured on a quarterly basis: 
(1)  All appointments for service, installation or disconnection shall be specified by date. Each franchisee shall specify a specific time at which the work shall be done, or offer a choice of time blocks, which shall not exceed four hours in length during normal business hours. If at any time an installer or technician believes it impossible to make a scheduled appointment time, an attempt to contact the customer will be made prior to the time of the appointment and the appointment rescheduled at a time that is convenient to the customer, if rescheduling is necessary. It is a franchisee's burden to prove it met an appointment. 
(2)  Requests for service, repair and maintenance shall be acknowledged by a trained customer service representative within 24 hours, or prior to the end of the next business day, whichever is earlier. 
(3)  Repairs and maintenance for outages and service interruptions must begin promptly, and, in any event, within 24 hours of the time the subscriber reports a problem to the franchisee or its representative or the interruption or need for repairs otherwise becomes known to the franchisee. Work on all other requests for repairs must be begun by the next business day after notification of the problem or at a later time mutually agreeable to a franchisee and a subscriber and reasonably timely pursued thereafter. 
(4)  A franchisee shall not cancel a service or Installation appointment with a customer after the close of business on the business day preceding the appointment. 
(5)  A franchisee shall keep emergency system maintenance and repair staff, capable of responding to and repairing system malfunctions or interruptions, on a 24-hour basis. 
(E)  Interruptions of service. 
(1)  A franchisee shall use reasonable best efforts to schedule maintenance on its cable system at times that will minimize the likelihood of service interruptions to subscribers. A franchisee may intentionally interrupt service on its cable system, except in emergency situations or, to the extent necessary to fix the affected subscriber's service problems, after a minimum of 48 hours' prior notice to subscribers, the City and public; provided, however, that planned maintenance that occurs between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. shall not require such notice to subscribers, but shall require best efforts to notify the City no less than 24 hours prior to the anticipated service interruption. Planned interruptions of service of less than 30 minutes in duration which are necessary to conduct planned maintenance shall not require notice to subscribers or the City. 
(2)  For each period in which a subscriber suffers an outage or service interruption for more than eight hours in any 24-hour period, other than a planned interruption pursuant to § 36-6(E)(1), above, a franchisee shall, upon request, credit against the subscriber's next bill an amount equal to 1/30 of the monthly charge for any service or service tier affected. The charge for any per-program selection that is materially affected by an outage or service interruption shall also be refunded or credited upon request. 
(F)  Notice to Subscribers. 
(1)  A franchisee shall provide the following materials to each subscriber at the time cable service is installed, at least annually thereafter, and at any time upon request. Copies of all such materials provided to subscribers shall also be provided to the City upon request. 
(a)  a written description of products and services offered, including a schedule of rates and charges, a list of channel positions, and a description of programming services, options, and conditions; 
(b)  a written description of the franchisee's installation and service maintenance policies; 
(c)  written instructions on how to use the cable service; 
(d)  a written description of the franchisee's billing and complaint procedures, including requests for credits in the event of outages or service interruptions.;

(g)  notice of the availability of other compatible equipment as required under 47 C.F.R. § 76.1621 as applicable. 
(2)  Except as applicable federal, state and local rate regulations may provide to the contrary, a franchisee shall provide the City and all subscribers with at least 30 days' prior notice of any significant changes in rates, programming services or channel positions. 
(3)  Each franchisee shall maintain a public file in accordance with FCC regulations. 
(G)  Billing. 
(1)  A franchisee's billing statement shall be clear, concise, and understandable. Bills must be fully itemized with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills shall clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates, and credits. 
(2)  Credits to subscribers shall be issued promptly, but no later than the later of: 
(a)  the subscriber's next billing cycle, or 30 days following resolution of the billing dispute, whichever is earlier; or 
(b)  the return of all equipment supplied by the franchisee, if service is terminated. 
(3)  Credits for service shall be issued no later than the subscriber's next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. 
(4)  A franchisee's first billing statement after a new installation or service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit. 
(5)  Fees for late payment of bills shall not be assessed until the next billing cycle after the service has been fully provided. 
(6)  If a subscriber terminates service before the end of a prepaid period, a pro rata portion of any unpaid service fee, using the actual number of days in the month as a basis, shall be refunded to the subscriber. 
(7)  A franchisee shall respond to all written billing complaints from subscribers within 30 days of receipt of the complaint. 
(H)  Disconnection/Downgrades. 
(1)  A subscriber may terminate service at any time. 
(2)  A franchisee shall promptly disconnect or downgrade any subscriber who so requests. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination or downgrade of service may be required of subscribers by any franchisee. So long as the subscriber returns, or permits the franchisee to retrieve, any equipment necessary to receive a service within five business days of the disconnection, no charge may be imposed by any franchisee for any cable service delivered after the date of the disconnect request. Franchisee may charge a subscriber for any cable service delivered or for the cost of equipment until any outstanding equipment is returned. 
(3)  A subscriber may be asked, but not required, to disconnect a franchisee's equipment and return it to the business office. 
(4)  Unless otherwise agreed between franchisee and subscriber, any security deposit and/or other funds due a subscriber that disconnects or downgrades service shall be returned to the subscriber within 60 days or in the next billing cycle, whichever is earlier, from the date the disconnection or the downgrade was requested, except in cases where the subscriber does not permit a franchisee to recover its equipment, in which case the amounts owed shall be paid to subscribers within 60 days of the date the equipment was recovered. 
(5)  Unless otherwise agreed between franchisee and subscriber, if a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber fee or other fee or charge, a franchisee may disconnect the subscriber's service; however, such disconnection shall not be effected until after 30 days from the due date of the monthly subscriber fee or other charge, plus at least ten days advance written notice to the subscriber in question of intent to disconnect, given after the 30 days have elapsed. If the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges, before the date scheduled for disconnection, the franchisee shall not disconnect service. After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the franchisee shall promptly reinstate service. Notwithstanding the foregoing franchisee may require a subscriber to provide a deposit in the event such prior disconnection was due to a non-payment for service. 
(6)  A franchisee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the subscriber is damaging or destroying the franchisee's cable system or equipment. 
(7)  A franchisee may also disconnect a subscriber that causes signal leakage in excess of federal limits. Disconnection may be effected after notice to the subscriber. In addition, a franchisee may disconnect a subscriber without notice where signal leakage is detected originating from the subscriber's premises in excess of federal limits, provided that the franchisee shall immediately notify the subscriber of the problem and, once the problem is corrected, reconnect the subscriber. 
(8)  Except as otherwise provided herein, franchisee shall reconnect service to subscribers wishing restoration of service, provided such a subscriber shall first satisfy any previous obligations owed and any deposit. 
(I)  Changes in service. 
(1)  Franchisee shall comply with all applicable federal or state laws regarding changes in service. Except as federal law otherwise provides, subscribers may not be required to pay any charge (other than regular service fees or charges), including an upgrade or downgrade charge, in order to receive the services selected. 
(2)  No charge may be made for any cable service or product that a subscriber has not affirmatively indicated it wishes to receive. Payment of the regular monthly bill does not in and of itself constitute such an affirmative indication. 
(3)  A franchisee not subject to effective competition shall not require a subscriber to purchase any service other than basic service as a condition of purchasing premium or pay-per-view programming. 
(J)  Parental Control Option. A franchisee shall make available, by sale or lease, to any subscribers upon request the option of blocking the video and/or audio portion of any channel or channels of programming entering the subscriber's home. The control option described herein shall be made available to all subscribers requesting it when any cable service is provided, or reasonably soon thereafter.

(L)  Enforcement. 
(1)  A franchisee shall keep such records as are necessary to show compliance with these customer service standards and FCC customer service standards. 
(2)  Within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter during the term of a franchise, or any extension(s) thereof, upon request of the City, a franchisee shall submit a quarterly report to the City, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the City, that shows whether the franchisee is meeting all applicable customer service standards, including, but not limited to: telephone answering and transfer time requirements; the minimum busy signal percentage; appointment scheduling and response requirements; subscriber notice and billing requirements; and disconnection procedures. 
(M)  Anticompetitive Acts prohibited. No franchisee shall engage in acts prohibited by federal or state law that have the purpose or effect of limiting competition for the provision of cable service or services similar to cable service in the City.

(B)  Not a tax or in lieu of any other tax or fee. 
(1)  Payment of the franchise fee shall not be considered in the nature of a tax or in lieu of other taxes or fees of general applicability imposed by the City. 
(2)  The franchise fee is in addition to all other taxes and payments that a franchisee may be required to pay under its franchise agreement or any federal, state, or local law, and to any other tax, fee, or assessment imposed by utilities and cable operators for use of their services, facilities, or equipment, including any applicable amusement taxes, except to the extent that such fees, taxes, or assessments must be treated as a franchise fee under Section 622 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 542. 
(C)  No accord or satisfaction. No acceptance of any payment by the City shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums due or for the performance of any other obligation of a franchisee, or as an acknowledgement that the amount paid is the correct amount due. 
(Ord. No. 03-O-10 § 4, 04-10-03) 
Section 36-9 - Performance guarantees and penalties. 
(A)  Penalties. As a condition precedent to the City agreeing to enter into any franchise agreement pursuant to this Chapter, a negotiated franchise agreement shall include requirements which shall provide that in the event of a violation of provisions of this Chapter or a franchise agreement entered into pursuant to this Chapter, penalties shall, consistent with the negotiated procedures of a franchise, be assessable against a franchisee and shall, consistent with the negotiated procedures of a franchise, be chargeable to a franchisee's security fund or letter of credit. In no event shall any franchisee be subject to multiple remedies or penalties provided for in any franchise or this Chapter for the same default or violation. 
(B)  Revocation/Termination. 
(1)  Any franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated pursuant to the terms of such franchise. Unless otherwise provided in a franchise, any franchise may be revoked or terminated 120 calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of a franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding. Provided, however, that a franchise may be reinstated at the City's sole discretion if, within that 120-day period: 
(a)  Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or 
(b)  Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this Chapter and the applicable franchise agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, under which it assumes and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, and such other conditions as may be established or as are required by applicable law. 
(2)  Unless otherwise provided in any franchise, in the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment, or property of a franchisee, the City Council may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the Council, by serving notice on the franchisee and the successful bidder, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate 30 calendar days after serving such notice, unless: 
(a)  The Council has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder; and

(D)  Remedies cumulative. All remedies under this Chapter and/or a franchise agreement are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not foreclose the use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties relieve a franchisee of its obligations to comply with its franchise or applicable law. Remedies may be used singly or in combination; in addition, the City may exercise any rights it has at law or equity. 
(E)  Relation to Insurance and Indemnity Requirements. Recovery by the City of any amounts under insurance, a security fund, a performance bond, letter of credit, or otherwise does not limit a franchisee's duty to indemnify and hold harmless the City and its elected and appointed officials, officers, boards, commissions, commissioners, employees and agents in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a franchisee of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to the City, or in any respect prevent the City from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize the double-recovery of damages. 
(Ord. No. 03-O-10 § 4, 04-10-03) 
Section 36-10 - Indemnification. 
(A)  Indemnification and Hold Harmless; Insurance. 
(1)  No franchise or other authorization to use the public rights-of-way issued to a franchisee shall be valid or effective until and unless the City obtains adequate indemnity from such franchisee. 
(2)  Unless otherwise provided in any franchise, the indemnity shall, at a minimum: 
(a)  indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the City, its elected and appointed officials, officers, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action (whether frivolous or otherwise), proceedings, and judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction, maintenance, or operation of a franchisee's cable system; 
(b)  provide that every franchisee shall agree not to seek monetary damages from the City, including the persons and entities described in this subsection, in connection with the above-mentioned matters; 
(c)  fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, and its elected and appointed officials, officers, boards, commissions, commissioners, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, suits, or causes of action of any kind or nature, and the resulting losses, costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees, orders, decrees, liabilities and judgments, whether for damages or otherwise, subject to 47 U.S.C. § 558, arising out of or alleged to arise out of any claim against a franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark, or patent, or of any other right of any Person, firm, or corporation. This indemnity does not apply to programming carried on any channel set aside for educational or governmental use, or channels leased pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 532, unless a franchisee was in any respect engaged in determining the editorial content of the program; and, 
(d)  provide that the covenants and representations relating to the indemnification and hold harmless provisions herein shall survive the term of any franchise for acts a franchisee committed while a franchise was in effect or performed under color of a franchise after the expiration, revocation, cancellation or termination of the franchise. 
(3)  The above information shall not apply to any claims, suits, cause of action, proceedings or judgments attributable to gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the City or any of its permitted designees, including, but not limited to, the City Council, Cable Commissioner or Cable Television Coordinator. 
(4)  Nothing in this Chapter or a franchise shall be construed to waive the tort or any other immunity or applicable defense of the City, and its elected and appointed officials, officers, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees. 
(5)  Neither the provisions of this subsection nor any damages recovered by the City shall be construed to limit the liability of a franchisee for damages to the City, its elected and appointed officials, officers, boards, commissions, commissioners, employees and agents under a franchise. 
(B)  Insurance. No franchise to use the public rights-of-way issued to a franchisee shall be valid or effective unless and until the City obtains assurance that the franchisee (and those acting on its behalf) have adequate insurance. At a minimum, unless otherwise agreed to between City and a franchisee in a franchise agreement, the following insurance requirements shall be satisfied by a franchise: 
(1)  A franchisee shall not commence construction or operation of a cable system without obtaining all insurance required under a franchise. The required insurance shall be obtained and maintained for the entire term of a franchise, or any extension(s) thereof. If a franchisee, its contractors or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, then the City may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained. 
(2)  Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance, shall be filed with the City. For entities that are entering the market, the certificates shall be filed prior to the commencement of construction and once a year thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage. For entities that have existing facilities in the public rights-of-way as of the effective date of this Chapter, the certificate shall be filed within 60 days of the date of this Chapter, annually thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage, unless a pre-existing franchise provides for filing of certificates in a different manner.

(Ord. No. 03-O-10 § 4, 04-10-03) 
Section 36-11 - Security requirement. 
(A)  Security. In accordance with the terms of a franchise agreement, every franchisee shall establish a security fund or letter of credit to secure the payment of fees owed, to secure any other performance promised in a franchise agreement or required by the Code, and to pay any taxes, fees or liens owed to the City. The City Council, or its designee, shall set the form of the security (e.g., bond or letter of credit) and the amount of the security fund or letter of credit in a franchise agreement. Any letter of credit that may be provided to satisfy this requirement shall be in a form acceptable to the City and with an institution acceptable to the City. 
(B)  Failure constitutes material violation. Failure to maintain or restore security fund or letter of credit as set forth in a franchise agreement shall constitute a material violation of this Chapter and a franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 03-O-10 § 4, 04-10-03] 
Section 36-12 - Transfers. 
(A)  No sale or transfer of or change in control of a franchise, or franchisee shall take place until a written request has been filed with the City requesting approval of the sale, transfer or change of control and such approval has been granted or deemed granted; provided, however, that said approval shall not be required in the event of a mortgage, transfer in trust, hypothecation, or assignment of any rights, title or interest of a franchisee (or any parent or affiliate) in a franchise or in a cable system in order to secure indebtedness; nor shall approval be required if a franchisee undertakes or is subject to changes to the corporate or partnership structures or ownership among or between its affiliates, provided there is no change in the controlling interests which materially alter the financial responsibilities for a franchisee. In any event, a franchisee will use reasonable efforts to notify the City of any such change. 
(B)  The term "change in control" means actual working control in whatever manner exercised. 
(C)  A franchisee shall file its request for approval reflecting the financial, legal and technical qualifications of transferee utilizing an FCC Form 394 Application for Consent, including all documents, forms and information required to be filed by applicable federal and state law. 
(D)  The City shall be reimbursed in an amount as set forth in a franchise agreement for all the actual reasonable out-of-pocket legal, administrative, and consulting costs and fees associated with the City's review of any request to transfer. 
(E)  The City shall have such time as is permitted by federal law in which to review a transfer request. 
(F)  In no event shall a sale, transfer, corporate change or assignment of ownership or control pursuant to subsections (A) or (B) of this Section be approved without a franchisee remaining, or (if other than a current franchisee) transferee becoming a signatory to a franchise and assuming or continuing to have all rights and obligations hereunder. 
(G)  The approval of any transfer of ownership pursuant to this Section shall not be deemed to waive any rights of the City to subsequently enforce noncompliance issues relating to a franchise. 
(H)  Any transfer or sale of a franchise without the prior written consent of the City shall be considered to impair the City's assurance of due performance. The granting of approval for a transfer or sale in one instance shall not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent transfer or sale for which approval would otherwise be required. 
(Ord. No. 03-O-10 § 4, 04-10-03) 
Section 36-13 - Rights of individuals protected. 
(A)  Discriminatory practices prohibited. A franchisee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise unlawfully discriminate against subscribers, programmers, or residents of the City. A franchisee shall not discriminate among persons or take any retaliatory action against a person because of that person's exercise of any right it may have under federal, state, or local law, nor may the franchisee require a person to waive such rights as a condition of taking service. A franchisee shall not deny access or levy different rates and charges on any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides. A franchisee may offer temporary, promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the City; and a franchisee may offer discounts for the elderly, the handicapped, not-for-profit persons or organizations, or the economically disadvantaged, and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under federal law, if such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee shall comply at all times with all applicable federal, state, and City laws, and all executive and administrative orders relating to non-discrimination. 
(B)  Subscriber privacy. A franchisee shall at all times protect the privacy rights of all subscribers in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 631 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 551 or other applicable federal or state law.

(B)  Removal or destruction prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person, without the consent of a franchisee, to willfully tamper with, remove, or injure in any manner any part or segment of a system for any purpose whatsoever, except for any rights subscribers may have under applicable laws and regulations and any rights the City may have pursuant to this Chapter or a franchise agreement.

(A)  Duties of the Cable Commission. The Cable Commission, either directly or through a duly appointed designee, shall have the responsibility for regulating rates for cable service and for overseeing the day-to-day administration of this Chapter and any franchise agreements.

(C)  Transfer of Authority. If at any time the powers of the Council or the Commission, or any agency, commission or official of the City or the Council are transferred by law to another board, agency, commission, authority or official, then such other board, agency, commission, authority or official shall have the powers, rights and duties previously vested under this Chapter or by law in the Council or the Commission, or any agency or official of the City or the Council. 
(Ord. No. 03-O-10 § 4, 04-10-03) 
Section 36-17 - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(A)  Compliance with laws. A franchisee shall not evade or attempt to evade applicable federal, state or local regulation of cable systems. 
(B)  No recourse against the City. Without limiting such immunities as the City or other persons may have under applicable law, a franchisee shall have no monetary recourse against the City or its officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees for any loss, cost, expense, claim, liability or damage arising out of any action undertaken or not undertaken by a franchisee pursuant to this Chapter or a franchise, whether or not such action or non-action was required by this Chapter or a franchise, arising out of the enforcement or non-enforcement by the City or the City Council of any provision requirement of this Chapter or a franchise, or otherwise arising out of this Chapter or a franchise. Nothing in the foregoing shall limit a franchisee's right to seek injunctive relief or other non-monetary relief as permitted under applicable law. 
(C)  Rights and remedies. 
(1)  The rights and remedies reserved to the City by this Chapter are cumulative and shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other rights and remedies which the City may have with respect to the subject matter of this Chapter provided that in no event shall a franchisee be subject to multiple remedies for the same default or violation. 
(2)  The City hereby reserves to itself the right to intervene in any suit, action or proceeding involving any provision of this Chapter or a franchise agreement. 
(3)  Specific mention of the materiality of any of the provisions herein is not intended to be exclusive of any others for the purpose of determining whether any failure of compliance hereunder is material and substantial. 
(4)  No franchisee shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter or a franchise agreement by reason of any past failure of the City to enforce compliance. 
(D)  Amendments to this Chapter. In order to fulfill the public interest goals of this Chapter, the City specifically reserves the right to amend this Chapter to effectuate the public interest. 
(E)  Public emergency. In the event of a major public emergency or disaster as determined by the City or declared by the Governor of Tennessee, a franchisee shall immediately make the entire cable system, employees, and property, as may be necessary, available for use by the City or other civil defense or governmental agency designated by the City to operate the system for the term of such emergency or disaster for the emergency purposes. In the event of such use, a franchisee shall waive any claim that such use by the City constitutes a use of eminent domain, provided that the City shall return use of the entire system, employees, and property to the franchisee after the emergency or disaster has ended or has been dealt with, and City shall waive any claim or enforcement authority to assert that any action or inaction of franchisee resulting from such use constitutes a default or other non-compliance under its franchise agreement or this Chapter. 
(F)  Connections to system; use of antennae. To the extent consistent with federal law, subscribers shall have the right to attach devices to a franchisee's system to allow them to transmit signals or services for which they have paid to VCRs, receivers, and other terminal equipment, so long as such devices do not interfere with the operation of the cable system, or the reception of any cable subscriber, nor serve to circumvent the security procedures established by the franchisee, nor for any purpose to obtain services illegally. Subscribers also shall have the right to use their own remote control devices and converters, and other similar equipment, and a franchisee shall provide information to consumers which will allow them to adjust such devices so that they may be used with the franchisee's system. 
Except as permitted under applicable law, franchisee shall not, as a condition of providing service, require a subscriber or potential subscriber to remove any existing antenna or disconnect an antenna, or prohibit or discourage a subscriber from installing an antenna switch, provided that such equipment and installations are consistent with applicable codes and technically able to shield the cable system from any interference. 
(G)  Calculation of time. Unless otherwise indicated, when the performance or doing of any act, duty, matter, or payment is required under this Chapter or any franchise agreement, and a period of time or duration for the fulfillment thereof is prescribed and is fixed herein or therein, the time shall be computed so as to exclude the first and include the last day of the prescribed or fixed period of time. 
(H)  Severability. If any term, condition, or provision of this Chapter shall, to any extent, be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder hereof shall be valid in all other respects and continue to be effective. In the event of a subsequent change in applicable law so that the provision which had been held invalid is no longer invalid, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect without further action by the City or the Council and shall thereafter be binding on a Franchisee and the City. 
(I)  Captions. The captions and headings of sections throughout this Chapter are intended solely to facilitate reading and reference to the sections and provisions of this Chapter. Such captions shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Chapter.

development; and preserving landmark buildings, objects and sites.
To these ends, the regulations contained in this article are to:
Divide the City into districts of such number, shape and area and of such different classes

Section 4. General Plan and Procedure.
(A) Authority. The Planning Department has the authority to prepare and recommend a
general plan. The Planning Commission has the authority to adopt, amend, extend,
or add to such general plan or carry any part of the subject matter into greater detail.
(B) Purpose and definition. The general plan shall include the Commissions
recommendations for policies and goals regarding the physical development of the
area of the municipal planning jurisdiction and of the urban growth boundary. It shall
also identify areas where there are inadequate or nonexistent publicly or privately
owned and maintained services and facilities when the Planning Commission has
determined the services are necessary in order for development to occur, and may
include, among other things, the general location, character and extent of streets,
parks, parkways, airports and other public ways, grounds, places and spaces, the
general location of public buildings and other public property, and the general location
and extent of public utilities. The Major Thoroughfare Plan, as it may be amended
from time to time, shall be considered a part of the general plan. The plan shall also
include a zoning plan for the regulation of the height, area, bulk, location, and use of
private and public structures and premises; the general location, character, layout
and extent of community centers and neighborhood units; and the general location,
character, extent, and layout of the re-planning of blighted districts and slum areas.
The terms general plan and comprehensive plan may be used interchangeably.
(C) Effect. A general plan shall be considered an advisory document to be used by the City
Council, Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, administrative agencies,
departments, and personnel responsible for the administration of this article. The
recommendations and statements contained in the general plan shall not be binding,
except as required in Section 4(D)(2)(b)[1] below, if the plan is adopted by the City
Council.
(D) Procedure for development, adoption, and amendment. The general plan shall
be developed, adopted, and amended as follows, consistent with Tennessee Code
Annotated:
(1) Development of plan. The Planning Department or its designee shall develop all
or any portion of the general plan and in so doing, may conduct such studies as
it deems appropriate or that are requested by the administration, the Planning
Commission, or the City Council. Citizens advisory groups appointed by the Mayor
may assist the Commission in the development of all or any portion of the general
plan.
(2) Adoption and Amendment of plan.
(a) Prior to the adoption of the general plan or any part(s) of the plan by the
Planning Commission, or any amendment thereto, the Commission shall hold
a public hearing thereon, the time and place of which shall be published in
a newspaper of general circulation in a municipality at least thirty (30) days
prior to the meeting in which the adoption is to be considered. The adoption
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:31
APPENDIX A - ZONING
of the plan or any part, amendment, or addition shall be by resolution carried
by the affirmative votes of not less than a majority of all the members of the
Commission. The resolution shall refer expressly to the maps, descriptive
matter, and other matters intended by the Commission to form the whole or
part of the plan, and the action taken shall be recorded on the adopted plan or
part thereof and descriptive matter by the identifying signature of the Secretary
of the Commission, and a copy of the plan or part thereof shall be certified to
the City Council.
(b) Once the Commission has adopted the general plan or amendment of the
general plan for the planning jurisdiction of the Commission, the Commissions
transmittal of the certification to the City Council may simultaneously include
a resolution by the Planning Commission requesting the consideration and
adoption of the general plan by the City Council.
[1] If the Planning Commissions resolution calls for the adoption of the plan
by the City Council, then prior to its adoption of an ordinance adopting the
general plan or amendment of the general plan, the City Council shall hold
a public hearing thereon, the time and place of which shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the municipality at least thirty (30) days
prior to the City Councils meeting in which the plan or amendment is to be
first considered. Adoption shall be by the affirmative votes of not less than
a majority of all the members of the City Council. After the adoption of the
general plan by the City Council, any land use decisions thereafter made
by the City Council, the Planning Commission, or Board of Zoning Appeals,
when the Board of Zoning Appeals is exercising its powers on matters other
than variances, must be consistent with the plan. The general plan may be
adopted as an element of the jurisdictions growth plan through the process
established in the Tennessee Code Annotated but if the general plan is not
adopted as part of the growth plan, it nevertheless cannot be inconsistent
with the growth plan or the intent of Tennessee Code Annotated.
[2] If the general plan is adopted by the City Council, the Planning Commission
may initiate an amendment to the general plan. If the Planning Commission
votes to adopt an amendment to the general plan, the Planning Commission
shall transmit its action to the City Council and the City Council must pass
the amendment by the affirmative votes of not less than a majority of all the
members of the City Council in order for the amendment to be operative.
[3] The general plan may also be amended upon the initiative of the City Council.
The initiative must be transmitted, in writing, to the Planning Commission
for its review, consideration and vote. The Planning Commission must take
action on the amendment and transmit its action to the City Council within
sixty-one (61) days of the submittal of the amendment to the Planning
Commission by the City Council. If the Planning Commission votes to
approve or not approve the amendment or transmits the amendment back
to the City Council with no recommendation, the City Council must then
approve the amendment by the affirmative votes of not less than a majority
of all the members of the City Council.

the manner in which the special use will be conducted or operated, including,
but not limited to, the following:
[1] the hours and days of operation;
[2] the duration of the proposed special use;
[3] the number of expected customers, patrons, clients, or patients that will
be expected to utilize any proposed facility or participate in any program
connected with the proposed special use; and,
[4] the projected traffic that will be expected to be generated by the proposed
special use;
(h) the potentially harmful characteristics of the proposed special use for the
zoning district in which it is proposed to be located and the manner in which the
applicant proposes to eliminate or minimize them.
(2) Not more than forty-five days after an application for a special use permit is filed, the
BZA shall hold a public hearing thereon. Written notice of such public hearing shall
be published in a newspaper of general circulation in this community. In addition,
a sign shall be posted and maintained on the subject property by the applicant
which conforms to the size and content requirements of the BZA, and notice shall
be mailed to property owners within two hundred fifty feet. Failure to mail notice
to such owner(s) will not invalidate the special use permit. The BZA may approve,
disapprove, or approve subject to conditions after deliberations of the proposed
special use application. The BZA may take the matter under advisement or defer
decision until the next regular meeting or special called meeting.
The heretofore described notification requirements shall not be required for
applications for family violence shelters when the applicant can demonstrate to the
Planning Director that there is a compelling need for confidentiality of location and
that by advertising in the previously described manner the personal safety of the
potential inhabitants of the proposed family violence shelter would be threatened.
In this event the Director shall advise the BZA in writing that the notification
requirements are to be waived.
(3) Additionally, an owner or other person having a contractual interest in a property
which is the site of a proposed special use may, with the approval of the Planning
Staff, submit an application requesting a preliminary special use permit if some
of the information required under subsection (1) will not be available at the time
the application is heard by the BZA. It is the purpose of this provision to enable
an applicant for a special use permit to learn if there appear to be fundamental
difficulties with the proposed special use at the proposed site before the applicant
expends the time and funds necessary to develop all the information required by
subsection (1). The BZA may grant a preliminary conditional special use permit if
the application contains sufficient information for the BZA to reasonably conclude
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:49
APPENDIX A - ZONING
that the property has the capacity to meet the general and specific standards
for the proposed special use set forth in Section 9. The granting of a preliminary
conditional special use permit does not grant the applicant any vested rights, or the
privileges set forth in subsection (E), nor does it entitle the applicant to a special
use permit. A special use permit may be issued to an applicant who has received a
preliminary special use permit only after the procedures described in subsections
(1) and (2) have been fully complied with and the BZA has approved the special
use application. The time limitation on reapplication in subsection (H) does not
apply to applications for a preliminary conditional special use permit.
(E) Effect of issuance of special use permit. The issuance of a special permit shall not
allow the development of the site for the special use, but shall merely authorize the
filing of applications for required permits and approvals, including, but not limited to,
building permits and certificates of occupancy.
(F) Assurance of compliance with conditions. The Building Official shall not issue a
certificate of occupancy for a special use if any of the conditions, imposed by the BZA
in approving the special use permit, have not been met.
(G) Amendments to special permits. A special use permit may be amended pursuant to
the same procedure and in accordance with the same standards which governed its
grant.
(H) Reapplication if denied. If an application for a special use permit is denied by the BZA,
a reapplication pertaining to the same property and requesting the same special use
permit may not be filed within eighteen months of the date final action was taken on
the previous application unless such reapplication is initiated by the Department or
authorized by the BZA.

the uses specified on Chart 1 in accordance with the procedure for the issuance of
such permits set forth in Section 8 of this article.
(B) Conditions on special uses. The BZA may impose such conditions upon the premises
benefited by a permit for a special use as may be necessary to prevent or minimize
any adverse effects of such special use upon and to ensure the compatibility of the
special use with other property in the vicinity of such special use. These conditions
may be in addition to the minimum standards for special permit uses specified in
subsection (D)(2). Such conditions shall be set forth in the resolution authorizing such
special permit use and in the special use permit. A violation of such conditions shall be
a violation of this article. The BZA is authorized to revoke a permit for a special use
when the conditions imposed upon the premises benefited by a permit for a special
permit use have been violated or have not been met.

Explanation:
F.A.R. X lot area = maximum total floor area.
L.S.R. X lot area = required livability space.
Lot area - (O.S.R. X lot area) = maximum building coverage of a lot.
Example with a 20,000 square foot lot:
Maximum total floor area = 6,000 square feet.
Minimum required livability space = 9,600 square feet.
Maximum building coverage = 6,000 square feet.
Definition of Livability Space: The portion of open space not devoted to motor
vehicle parking or circulation of public streets or alley rights-of-way, and which
is landscaped, or improved as outdoor living or recreation space for occupants
of the premises and which is used as beneficial open space provided that such

Section 10. Variances.
(A) Authority. The Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) shall have the authority to grant the
variances specified in this article after a public hearing on a requested variance and
only if the BZA makes specific written findings in favor of such variance based upon
the standards for variance hereinafter set forth.
(B) Purpose. The purpose of a variance is to provide relief from one or more zoning
regulations set forth in this article where due to the unusual characteristics of a parcel
of land, strict compliance with such regulation(s) would be extraordinarily and peculiarly
difficult or would result in an undue hardship for the a landowner or some other person
with a contractual interest in the land.
(C) Initiation. The owner or a person having a contractual interest in the land for which a
variance is sought may initiate a request for a variance.
(D) Procedure.
(1) Application. The owner or a person having a contractual interest in the land to be
affected by the variance shall file an application for a variance with the Planning
Department. Such application shall be accompanied by a non-refundable application
fee established from time to time by City Council. However, no application fee is
required when the applicant is seeking a variance to relocate a sign because of
condemnation or road construction by the city, county, state or federal government.
The application shall contain the following information:
(a) name, address, and telephone number of the applicant;
(b) nature and extent of the applicants interest in the land for which a variance is
requested;
(c) a plot plan showing the dimensions of the land for which a variance is requested;
(d) the street address and legal description of the land for which a variance is
requested;
(e) zoning classification of the land for which a variance is requested;
(f) a statement of the exact variance sought and section of this article from which
a variance is requested;
(g) a statement of the purpose for the requested variance and the intended
development of land if the variance is granted; and
(h) a vicinity map showing the land which is the site of the requested variance and
all parcels of land within a 250-foot radius of the land. Such vicinity map shall
show any and all streets, roads or alleys, and shall indicate the owners name
and dimensions of each parcel of land shown.
(2) Action by the BZA. Not more than forty-five days after an application is filed, the
BZA shall hold a public hearing thereon. Written notice of such public hearing
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation. In addition, a sign shall
be posted and maintained on the subject land by the applicant or the City that
conforms with the size and content requirements of the BZA, and written notice
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:86
APPENDIX A - ZONING
shall be mailed to land owners within a 250-foot radius from the subject land.
Failure to mail notice to such owner(s) will not invalidate any action of the BZA.
Prior to the adjournment of the meeting at which such public hearing is concluded,
the BZA may act on the requested variance, take the matter under advisement, or
defer decision until the next regular or special called meeting of the BZA. Notice of
the BZAs decision, along with its written findings, shall be mailed to the applicant
within fifteen days after the date of the BZAs decision on the requested variance.
(E) Standards for Variance. To be entitled to a variance an Applicant must be shown by
substantial material evidence:
(1) That the specifically identified characteristics of the land, such as the narrowness,
shallowness, shape, topography or other condition of the land, are such that
compliance with one or more applicable zoning regulations would be extraordinarily
and peculiarly difficult or would result in an undue hardship for the Applicant;
(2) That the specifically identified characteristics are unusual to the subject land as
compared to other land in the same zoning classification and in the same area;
(3) That the specifically identified characteristics or hardship were not created by any
action or inaction of the owner or the owners agent;
(4) That granting the requested variance will not be unduly detrimental to other land in
the vicinity of the land for which the variance is requested; and
(5) That granting the requested variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent properties, unreasonably increase the congestion in public
streets, increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public health, safety,
comfort, or morals, or substantially impair the intent and purpose of the Zoning
Ordinance or of the general plan for the area.
(F) The BZA shall make specific written findings of fact on each of the above standards in
either granting or denying a variance. Specific written findings that each of the above
standards has been met by the applicant are required in order to grant a variance.
If in the judgment of the BZA each of the above standards has not been met by a
preponderance of the evidence, the variance must be denied.
(G) Conditions on variances. The BZA may set forth conditions in the written resolution
granting a variance. Such conditions may relate to screening, landscaping, location,
and other conditions necessary to preserve the character of the area and protect land
in the vicinity of the variance. A violation of such conditions shall be a violation of this
article.
(H) Determination of compliance with conditions. The Zoning Administrator shall determine
when the applicant has complied with the conditions set forth in the resolution granting
the variance.
(I) Effect of grant of variance. The grant of a variance shall not allow the development
of the land for which a variance was granted but shall merely authorize the filing of
applications for required permits and approvals, including, but not limited to, building
permits, and certificates of occupancy.
(J) Length of variance. Variances are valid for an unlimited time, irrespective of ownership,
unless otherwise conditioned by the BZA. However, if the plan submitted to the BZA
at the time of the variance request changes and the Zoning Administrator determines
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:87
APPENDIX A - ZONING
that the changes are material, the variance shall automatically become void and a
new variance application must be submitted to the Planning Department.

(A) Authority. After consultation with the Planning Director, the City Attorney may render
an interpretation on any regulatory provision of this article in connection with reviews
of building permit applications for zoning compliance or written requests for opinions
directed to the City Attorney.
(B) Procedure. If the Zoning Administrator determines that a regulatory provision of this
article is so unclear or ambiguous that an interpretation of the provision is necessary
to process a building permit application for zoning compliance in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5 of this article, the City Attorney shall interpret such provision.
After interpretation of such provision, the Zoning Administrator shall determine whether
the proposed development is consistent with the City Attorneys interpretation and
shall continue to process such building permit application for zoning compliance in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of this article.

Section 13. Planned Development Regulations.
(A) Purpose and Intent. The purposes of these planned development district regulations
are as follows:
(1) to promote flexibility in development design and to permit planned diversification in
the location of structures;
(2) to promote the efficient use of land by permitting a planned arrangement of
buildings, circulation systems, land uses, and utilities;
(3) to preserve existing landscape features and amenities and to utilize such features
in a harmonious fashion;
(4) to encourage the total planning of land tracts consistent with adopted long-range
plans;
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:89
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(5) to permit the use of new and innovative land development techniques while
assuring protection of existing adjacent development;
(6) to encourage the functional and beneficial use of open spaces and to preserve
natural features of a development site;
(7) to promote the creation of a safe and desirable living environment for residential
areas characterized by a unified site and development program;
(8) to permit the creation of a variety of housing types compatible with surrounding
development to provide a greater choice of types of environment and living units;
(9) to promote the provision of attractive and appropriate locations for business
and manufacturing uses in well-designed developments and the provision of
opportunities for employment closer to residences with a reduction in travel time
from home to work;
(10) to encourage the revitalization of established commercial centers;
(11) to promote the diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the relationship
of uses, structures, open space, and height of structures in developments intended
as cohesive, unified projects;
(12) to encourage design in the development of land that is of a higher quality than is
possible under the regulations otherwise applicable to the property; and,
(13) to promote the significance of architectural and aesthetic improvements and details
in atypical developments.
(B) Regulations of general applicability for planned developments.
(1) Ownership and division of land. No tract(s) of land may be considered for or
approved as a planned development unless such tract(s) is under the single
ownership of a landowner as defined in this article. The holder of a written option
to purchase or any governmental agency shall be considered a landowner for
purposes of this section. Unless otherwise provided as a condition of approval of
a planned development, the landowner of an adopted planned development may
divide and transfer parts of such development provided that the transferee shall be
obligated to complete each such part, and use and maintain it in strict conformance
with the approved planned development.
(2) Waiver of BZA action. No action of the BZA shall be required in the approval of
a planned development including those activities or uses which would otherwise
require special use permits as provided by other provisions of this article.
(3) Common space and common elements.
(a) Where provided, common space must be usable for recreational purposes
or must provide visual, aesthetic and environmental amenities. The uses
authorized for the common space must be appropriate to the scale and character
of the planned development, considering its size, density, expected population,
topography, and the number and type of dwellings or other buildings to be
constructed.
(b) Common space must be suitably improved for its intended use, but open space
containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. Any
buildings, structures or other improvements to be located in the common space
must be appropriate and must conserve and enhance the amenities of the
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:90
APPENDIX A - ZONING
common space having regard to its topography and the intended function of the
common space.
(c) The development phasing sequence must coordinate construction of
improvements. In no event shall occupancy permits for any phase of the planned
development be issued unless and until the common space and common
elements which are part of that phase have been dedicated, or conveyed
and improved, or performance bonds, letters of credit, or other acceptable
performance guarantees have been posted to assure completion.
(d) No common space or common elements of a planned residential development
shall be conveyed or dedicated by the developer or any other person to any
public body, homeowners association or other responsible party unless the
Planning Commission has determined that the character and quality of the tract
to be conveyed makes it suitable for the intended purpose. The Commission may
give consideration to the size and character of the dwellings to be constructed
within the planned development, the topography and existing trees, the ground
cover, other natural features, and the manner in which the common space is to
be improved and maintained for recreational or amenity purposes.
(e) The Commission shall not approve a planned development unless adequate
provision has been made for continued maintenance of common space or
common elements in a manner which assures its maintenance and use for its
intended purpose.
(4) Accessibility of site. All proposed streets, alleys and driveways shall be adequate
to serve the residents, occupants, visitors, emergency and sanitation vehicles or
other anticipated traffic of the planned development, but may be designed so as to
discourage outside through traffic from transversing the development. The location
of the entrance points of the streets, alleys, and driveways upon existing public
roadways shall be subject to the approval of the Commission. The Commission may
condition approval on the construction of improvements such as street widening,
curbs, gutters, and sidewalks to existing contiguous streets and or the provision of
connections to community greenways, bicycle paths or routes, or pedestrian ways.
(5) Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall be conveniently accessible to all
dwelling units and other uses. Where appropriate, common driveways, parking
areas, walks, and steps may be provided, maintained and lighted for night use.
Screening of parking and service areas may be required through use of trees,
shrubs, hedges and/or screening walls.
(6) Pedestrian circulation. The pedestrian circulation system and its related walkways
shall be separated, whenever feasible, from the vehicular street system in order
to provide an appropriate degree of separation of pedestrian and vehicular
movement. As a condition of approval, the Commission or City Council may require
the construction of sidewalks to facilitate safe pedestrian movement.
(7) Privacy. The planned development shall provide reasonable visual and acoustical
privacy for dwelling units within and adjacent to the planned development. Protection
and enhancement of property and the privacy of its occupants may be provided by
the screening of objectionable views or uses and reduction of noise through the
use of fences, insulation, natural foliage, berms, and landscape barriers. Should
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:91
APPENDIX A - ZONING
high-rise buildings be approved, they shall be located within the development in
such a manner as to minimize any adverse impact on adjoining low-rise buildings.
(8) Relationship to the Subdivision Regulations and the other zoning regulations. The
ordinance approving the planned development may provide for such exceptions
from the non-overlay district zoning regulations governing use, density, area, bulk,
parking, and such Subdivision Regulations as may be necessary or desirable
to achieve the objectives of the proposed planned development, provided such
exceptions are consistent with the standards and criteria contained in this section
and have been specifically identified and requested in the application for a planned
development. Unless the ordinance approving a planned development contains
a clear statement of exceptions to them, the standards and criteria of the district
zoning regulations (non-overlay) will apply to all planned developments. The only
exceptions to overlay district regulations permitted in a planned development are
exceptions, in the Battlefield Protection District zone and the Gateway Design
Overlay District zone, to a building height, a setback, or a landscaping requirement.
(9) Development period; phasing. The expeditious construction of any planned
development approved under these regulations shall be undertaken to assist in
the assurance of the full completion of the development.
(a) Start of development. Within eighteen months from and after the effective date
of the ordinance approving the planned development, actual construction shall
have commenced in such development. For the purposes of this subsection,
actual construction is defined to include the permanent fastening of construction
materials on-site or extensive grading including demolition or removal of
existing structures necessary for the development. In the event that actual
construction shall have not begun within eighteen months, the Commission
shall, at least every eighteen months thereafter, review the zoning of the
planned development and may recommend that the City Council take action
to zone the land back to the zoning classification placed upon the land prior to
the adoption of the ordinance approving the planned development. Any permit
issued for such planned development shall become void if actual construction
has not commenced within the eighteen month period, and no new permit shall
be issued until appropriate action or review by the Commission.
(b) The Commission may permit the development to progress in phases and
sections, provided, each phase or section of the development is so planned
and so related to existing surroundings and available facilities and services that
failure to proceed to subsequent stages will not have an adverse impact on the
initial phases or sections of the planned development or its surroundings.
(10) Annexation. An application for planned development approval may be made
simultaneous with a request for annexation. In which case the annexation and
application for the planned development shall proceed as provided in Section 17
of this article.
(11) Landscaping. Landscaping for planned developments shall generally conform to
the minimum requirements for landscaping and screening as established in Section
27 of this article.
(C) Planned development districts.
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:92
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(1) PRD, Planned Residential District. Any planned development for a land use, uses,
or combination of uses permitted by right or by special use permit in the RS-15, RS-

(B) Omitted land. It is the intent of this article that the entire area of the City, including
all land and water areas, rivers, streets, alleys, railroads and other rights of way, be
included in the districts established by this article. Any area not shown on the zoning
district maps as being included in any such district shall be deemed to be and is
hereby classified in the RS-15 Single-Family Residential District.
(C) District boundaries. In the event that any uncertainty exists with respect to the intended
boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning district map, the following
rules shall apply:
(1) The district boundaries are the centerlines of the streets, alleys, waterways and
rights-of-way, unless otherwise indicated. Where designation of a boundary line
on the zoning district map coincides with the location of a street, alley, waterway
or right-of-way, the centerline of the street, alley, waterway, or right-of-way shall be
construed to be the boundary of such district.
(2) Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of streets, alleys,
waterways and rights-of-way but do coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be
construed to be the boundaries of such district.
(3) Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of streets, alleys,
waterways and rights-of-way or lot lines, the district boundary shall be determined
by the use of the scale shown on the zoning district map.
(4) Where the district boundaries are not otherwise shown, and where the property
has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the district boundaries
shall be construed to be the lot lines, and where the district designation on the map

APPENDIX A - ZONING
Section 17. Annexed Land.
All land annexed to the City shall for an interim period, between the time it is annexed until
it proceeds through the zoning process and is otherwise zoned, be zoned in the following
manner:
(1) areas zoned agricultural or residential shall be zoned RS-15;
(2) areas zoned commercial shall be zoned C-L; and,
(3) areas zoned industrial or manufacturing shall be zoned L-I.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, when the petition for annexation also has a zoning plan
request for the subject property, the Planning Commission and City Council may consider
a proposed zoning ordinance simultaneously with the annexation request. In which event,
the Commission may hold a public hearing for the zoning plan immediately after the
public hearing for annexation. In like manner, Council may hold a public hearing for the
zoning plan immediately after the public hearing for annexation. The zoning ordinance
may be voted on separately but at the same meeting as the annexation ordinance. The
procedure and fee for considering a zoning plan for land in the process of annexation
shall be the same as for considering amendments to the zoning map provided in Section
6 of this article.

Section 18. Regulations of General Applicability.
(A) Maintenance of established open space. No existing yard or open spaces shall be
reduced below the minimum bulk regulations of this article; except that no existing
yards or open spaces shall be used to satisfy the minimum bulk regulations of this
article for any other use or building unless the existing yards and open spaces are not
reduced below the minimum bulk regulations.
(B) One building per lot. Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be
located on a lot as herein defined and in no case shall there be more than one main
building on one lot unless otherwise provided in this article. The provisions of this
paragraph shall not apply to property owned by the City of Murfreesboro, Rutherford
County, State of Tennessee, federal government, or to buildings containing multiple
family dwellings.
(C) Building orientation and screening of service areas.
(1) Building Orientation. Except as may otherwise be provided in this article, no
principal structure shall be constructed or placed upon any lot unless the front of
such structure is oriented to face the front lot line. Upon corner lots, the structure
shall be oriented with the front facing toward the street with the higher functional
classification as determined by the Major Thoroughfare Plan and any amendments
thereto. The front of a structure shall be that elevation of the structure containing
the formal or main entryway or containing such other architectural elements as
would lead a reasonable person to perceive it as the front of the structure.
(2) Screening of service areas. Service areas, loading docks and storage areas shall
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:105
APPENDIX A - ZONING
be incorporated into the building design and oriented so that they are screened
from adjacent right-of-ways by use of vegetation, earth berms, masonry walls or
a combination of such. The rear of buildings shall not face onto any street unless
the rear of the building is screened with a minimum of a type C buffer as described
in Section 27 of this article. Mechanical, utilities, or other building elements that
must be roof mounted shall be located and screened so that are not visible from
any point six feet above ground level or from any public right-of-way.
(3)To confirm compliance with the requirements of this section architectural elevations
shall be submitted along with the site plan required in Section 7. SITE PLAN
REVIEW of this article (Appendix A  Zoning).
(D) Solid Waste Management.
(1) All developments shall make adequate provision for effective solid waste
management. Adequacy of solid waste management systems proposed shall be
measured by the following standards:
(a) Each single family attached or detached residential owner or occupant shall
utilize an automated garbage system refuse container approved by the Solid
Waste Department unless otherwise indicated in Chapter 14 of the City Code. A
location shall be provided on-site for the refuse container so as to be readily
accessible for removal by the City through the automated garbage collection
system on the day of collection. A location not visible from the public right-ofway
shall also be provided for storage of the container.
(b) Each unit in two, three, and four family residential units shall utilize an automated
garbage system refuse container approved by the Solid Waste Department
unless otherwise indicated in Chapter 14 of the City Code. A location shall
be provided on-site for the refuse container so as to be readily accessible for
removal by the City through the automated garbage collection system on the
day of collection. A location not visible from the public right-of-way shall also
be provided for storage of the container.
(c) Multiple-family developments with more than 15 dwelling units shall make
provision for solid waste collection through a commercial collection service
and to facilitate such service shall: use multiple garbage containers placed in
unobstructed enclosures, or on-site dumpsters placed at strategic locations,
or on-site garbage compacters placed at strategic locations. A multiple-family
development with more than 15 units may be approved for City provided solid
waste collection services by the Citys Planning Director as part of the site
review process if:
[1] The development is in a townhome or condominium format with each
dwelling unit having an entrance on the ground floor;
[2] Each dwelling unit has a location not visible from the public right-of-way for
storage of the container;
[3] The width of the public streets in the development and the turn radiuses of
all corners and cul-de-sacs on the public roads are sufficient for use of the
Citys automated side loader collection vehicles;
[4] The public street network of the development allows for the automated side
loader collection vehicles to service all dwelling units without having to back

APPENDIX A - ZONING
up.
If the development is approved for City provided solid waste collection services,
no provisions for multiple container locations, dumpsters or compactors shall
be required.
(2) In all commercial, multiple family, industrial, or institutional developments,
dumpsters, compactors and major elements for solid waste management: shall
be screened and buffered from view from the public right-of-way or adjoining
properties; shall be enclosed within a fence or wall; shall be constructed with a
concrete pad and apron to support service vehicles; and, shall be accessible to the
intended users.
(E) Conversion to condominium ownership. Properties being converted to condominium
ownership shall be inspected by the fire and building inspector and shall be brought up
to applicable standards or agreed to prior to the Planning Commission approving any
plat of a conversion. A copy of the homeowners association, by-laws of agreement
shall be provided to the Planning Director for the purpose of ensuring its compliance
with Horizontal Property Act of the State of Tennessee.
(F) Mobile home or house trailer in mobile home district only. No mobile home or house
trailer may be parked on any lot that fails to comply with the provisions established for
mobile home parks in this article.
(G)Site lighting. Exterior lighting is an essential part of the total design of all projects. Well
conceived lighting can extend the use of outdoor areas, create a sense of well-being
and add interest to the nighttime landscape.
Lighting should satisfy the objectives of security while creating a pleasing visual
environment. In an effort to reduce glare in the landscape, down lighting should be
emphasized while limiting the use of spotlights. Selective site and building accent
lighting is encouraged. For public protection and security, walkways and parking
areas, as well as non-defensible public space (i.e., hidden nooks, exterior stairwells,
dead end spaces) should be adequately lighted.
Lighting plans and schedules shall be provided along with submittal of site plans in
accordance with the requirements of Section 7. SITE PLAN REVIEW of this article.
Provided, however, that only a preliminary lighting plan depicting the location of
proposed lighting fixtures shall be required at the time of Planning Commission site
plan review with the complete lighting plan and schedules required at the time of
building permit application. The following considerations should be addressed during
the review process:
(1) Lighting levels shall meet applicable standards for safety and security for parking,
pedestrian and service areas.
(2) All light sources for a project shall be coordinated, including consideration of
adjacent light sources.
(3) All lighting fixtures shall be shielded to prevent glare. Light shall not be distributed
beyond an angle of thirty-five (35°) degrees from a vertical plane onto surrounding
properties.
(d) Lighting shall be designed so that illumination does not exceed one-half (1/2) foot
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:107
APPENDIX A - ZONING
candle beyond the property line. All lighting shall have the intensities and uniformity
ratio consistent with the Lighting Handbook of the Illuminations Engineering Society
of North America (IESNA).
(4) On-site lighting fixtures in residential developments shall not exceed sixteen
feet in height. For nonresidential developments with structures thirty-five feet or
less in height, fixtures shall not exceed twenty feet in height. For nonresidential
developments with structures greater than thirty-five feet in height, fixtures shall
not exceed a height of thirty feet. Shoebox-style lighting fixtures shall not be used
for poles of sixteen feet or less in height. In areas zoned H-I (Heavy Industrial), G-I
(General Industrial), or L-I (Light Industrial) to be developed with large parking lots
that will occasion maneuvering areas for large trucks, lighting poles and fixtures
may be a maximum height of 75 feet.
(5) Poles may be located within landscaped areas or islands; however, to avoid conflicts
with required landscaping, poles shall not displace or conflict with required parking
lot landscaping.
(6) Attached building or wall pack lighting shall be screened by the buildings
architectural features or contain a thirty-five (35°) degree cutoff shield.
(7) Ground-oriented, pedestrian-scale lighting shall be considered as an alternative to
pole-mounted fixtures along pedestrian walkways.
(8) No lighting fixtures shall have blinking, flashing or fluttering lights or other
illuminating devices which have changing light intensity, brightness or color, nor
shall any beacon light be permitted, except those required for fire alarm and/or
emergency systems.
(9) White light shall be required. Low-pressure sodium lighting is prohibited.
(10) Fixtures used for architectural lighting, such as facade, feature, and landscape
lighting, shall be aimed or directed to preclude light projection beyond immediate
objects intended to be illuminated.
(11) Internally illuminated canopies shall have flush or recessed lenses.
(12) No glare shall project into public right-of-way.
(13) Lighting shall be sensitive to the Stones River National Battlefield to avoid
intrusions of lighting onto the land within its authorized boundary.
(14) Light fixtures for recreational fields zoned P (Park) shall not exceed 80 feet in
height. Light fixtures for recreational fields at an institutional group assembly use,
where such institutional group assembly use is permitted by right, shall not exceed
80 feet in height. Light fixtures for recreational fields at an institutional group
assembly use, where such institutional group assembly use requires a special use
permit, may be approved up to a maximum height of 80 feet by the Board of Zoning
Appeals in its granting of the special use permit. The above standards pertaining
to light fixtures for recreational fields shall also apply to all overlay districts.
(15) In multi-family and single-family attached developments, exterior lighting levels
for parking and walkways shall be a minimum of 0.5 foot-candles. Lighting shall be
even, and hot spots are to be avoided. Switched light fixtures under the control of
residents may not be used in the foot-candle calculation.

an adverse impact on the property zoned RS, RD, RS-A, or PRD or the residential
portion of land zoned in the PUD classification. The BZA may consider any factor
having a bearing on the impact of such use on the residential uses including, but
not limited to, the actual distance of separation, the site design and arrangement,
proposed screening and buffering, the intended use, orientation of the structures
and site elements, traffic conditions, hours of operation, and sounds and smells
associated with the intended use, if any. As with any special use, the BZA may
place appropriate conditions upon its approval to assure compatibility of the
proposed use with the property in the RS, RD, RS-A, or PRD classifications or the
residential portion of land zoned in the PUD classification.

Section 24. Overlay District Regulations.
ARTICLE I. AOD, AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT.
Editors Note: Airport Height Regulations were first added to the Murfreesboro Zoning
Ordinance by Ord. No. 84-6, adopted January 19, 1984 and amended by Ord. No. 01-O-
12 §2-5, adopted on April 5, 2001 (the  effective date). By an amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance effective September 5, 2008, the name of this subsection was changed to be
consistent with other overlay districts in the Zoning Ordinance, and the regulations were
updated to be consistent with changes in FAA and TDOT regulations applicable to this
Airport.
(A) Purpose. The purpose of this Airport Overlay District is to establish regulations which
will reduce or eliminate hazards to air navigation to minimize or prevent the loss of
life, property damage, health and safety hazards, and government expenditures which
result from air traffic accidents. The Airport Overlay District includes the airspace
within and the land underneath all of the Zones described below.
(B) Definitions. For the purposes of this District the following words and terms shall have
the following meanings:
(1) Airport: The Municipal Airport, Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
(2) Airport elevation: The Airport elevation is six hundred fifteen feet MSL.
(3) Airport hazard: Any structure or tree or use of land which obstructs the airspace
required for the flight of aircraft in landing, taking-off or maneuvering of aircraft at
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:120
APPENDIX A - ZONING
the Airport or is otherwise hazardous to such landing, taking-off or maneuvering
of aircraft. Any structure or tree which projects beyond the horizontal and vertical
limits of the various zones herein established shall be deemed to constitute an
airport hazard.
(4) Airport Layout Plan: An Airport Layout Plan was adopted as a part of the Airport
Master Plan on June 11, 1996. An amended Airport Layout Plan was prepared
on October 7, 2003 and conditionally approved by the Tennessee Department of
Transportation on June 17, 2005. The Airport Layout Plan may be further amended
from time to time to reflect actual changes or additions in land use and structures
on and surrounding the Airport, which amendments may be independent of any
amendments to the Airport Master Plan.
(5) Airport Master Plan: An Airport Master Plan for the Airport was adopted on June
11, 1996.
(6) Airport Zone Map: An Airport Zone Map was proposed on June 11, 1996 in
conjunction with the Airport Master Plan, and was adopted by the City Council on
April 5, 2001, effective April 20 2001. An amended Airport Zone Map, based on the
amended Airport Layout Plan conditionally approved on June 17, 2005 is attached
to this subsection and adopted herewith as the Amended Airport Zone Map.
(7) Airport reference point: The Airport reference point is the exact center of the
runway.
(8) Nonconforming use: Any structure, tree, or use of land which does not conform to
a regulation prescribed in this subsection of this ordinance [Appendix A-Zoning],
which structure, tree or use of land was in existence at the effective date of the
regulation with which such structure, tree or use of land is not in conformance.
(9) Person: Any individual, firm, co-partnership, corporation, company, association,
joint stock association or body politic, and includes any trustee, receiver, assignee,
or other similar representative thereof.
(10) Structure: Any object constructed or installed by man, including but without
limitation, buildings, towers, smokestacks, or overhead transmission lines.
(11) Tree: Any object of natural growth.
(C) Zones. In order to carry out the purpose of this Airport Overlay District, Approach
Surface Zones, Horizontal Surface Zone, Conical Surface Zones, Transitional Surface
Zones and Runway Protection Zones are hereby established as hereinafter defined.
Such zones are illustrated in the Airport Layout Plan as from time to time amended.
Such zones are hereby incorporated into the Zoning Map of the City and such Zoning
Map shall be amended from time to time if these zones are modified.
(1) Approach Surface Zones. The Approach Surface Zones are inclined planes with
a slope of 34:1. The dimensions of the Approach Surface Zones are measured
horizontally. The Approach Surface Zones are symmetrically located with respect
to the extended runway centerline and are trapezoids beginning 200 ft. off the end
(as shown in the Airport Layout Plan) of each runway, with an inner width of 500 ft.,
a length of 10,000 ft., and an outer width of 3,500 ft. as shown in the Airport Layout
Plan.
(2) Horizontal Surface Zone. The Horizontal Surface Zone is a level plane 150 feet
above the established airport elevation. The Horizontal Surface Zones perimeter
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:121
APPENDIX A - ZONING
is established by swinging arcs away from the runway for a distance of 10,000
feet from a point located on the extended centerline 200 feet from the end of each
runway and connecting each arc with lines tangent to those arcs.
(3) Conical Surface Zone. The Conical Surface Zone extends upward and outward
from the periphery of the Horizontal Surface Zone with a slope of 20:1 measured
in a vertical plane passing through the airport reference point. Measuring
radially outward, from the periphery of the Horizontal Surface Zone, the Conical
Surface Zone extends for a horizontal distance shown in the Airport Layout Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the slope ratio of the Approach Surface Zone at the
north end (Runway 18) and south end (Runway 36) of the Airport is 34:1.
(4) Transitional Surface Zones. The Transitional Surface Zones are inclined planes
with a slope of 7:1 measured upward and outward in a vertical plane at right angles
to the centerline of the runway. The Transitional Surface Zones, symmetrically
located on either side of the runway, extend upward and outward from a line on
either side of the runway which is parallel to and level with the runway centerline.
These parallel lines are at a horizontal distance from the runway centerline equal
to one-half (1/2) of the minimum width of each Approach Surface Zone as shown
in the Airport Layout Plan.
(5) Runway Protection Zones. The Runway Protection Zones are horizontal
areas within the Approach Surface Zones. The Runway Protection Zones are
symmetrically located with respect to the extended runway centerlines and are
trapezoids beginning 200 ft. off the end (as shown in the Airport Layout Plan) of
each runway, with an inner width of 500 ft., a length of 1,000 ft. and an outer width
of 700 ft.
(D) Height limits. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no structure or tree
shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any Approach Surface
Zone, Horizontal Surface Zone, Conical Surface Zone or Transitional Surface Zone
to a height in excess of the height limit herein established and as shown in the Airport
Layout Plan for such zone. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law or ordinance
to the contrary, the height limits prescribed by this subsection shall not establish for
any particular parcel of land at any particular point within such parcel, a height limit of
less than 60 feet above the surface elevation of the land at that point.
(E) Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance [Appendix A 
Zoning], and subject to the provisions of paragraphs (F), (G) and (H) of this subsection:
(1) It shall be unlawful to put land within any Approach Surface Zone, Horizontal
Surface Zone, Conical Surface Zone, Transitional Surface Zone or Runway
Protection Zone, to use in such manner as to create electrical interference with
radio communication between the airport and aircraft, to make it difficult for flyers
to distinguish between airport lights and others, to result in glare in the eyes of
flyers using the airports, to impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise
to endanger the landing, taking-off, or maneuvering of aircraft.
(2) (a) No structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in
a Runway Protection Zone; and
(b) It shall be unlawful to put land within the Runway Protection Zones to the
following uses: residences and places of assembly including but not limited to
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:122
APPENDIX A - ZONING
churches and other places of worship, club houses and other meeting places;
schools, colleges, hospitals, sanitariums or other public, semipublic or private
educational, health or welfare institutions or facilities; shopping centers; fuel
storage facilities; any governmental office or building, the facilities of which
involve a concentration of people; any use which may deemed to attract wildlife;
and, any use which may be deemed to interfere with navigational aids.
(F) Nonconforming uses. The prohibitions in paragraphs (D) and (E) of this subsection
shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration
of any pre-existing structure or tree not conforming to these regulations as of the
effective date of the regulation with which such structure or, tree is not in conformance.
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or
intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was actually
begun prior to the effective date of the regulation with which such structure or tree
is not in conformance and is diligently prosecuted and completed within two years
thereof.
(G) Variances. Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use the property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this subsection, may apply for a variance there in
accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of this ordinance [Appendix A  Zoning].
(H) Permits.
(1) Future uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure
or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established, in any Approach
Surface Zone, Horizontal Surface Zone, Conical Surface Zone, Transitional
Surface Zone or Runway Protection Zone, unless a permit therefore shall have
been applied for and granted. Each such application shall indicate the purpose for
which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined
whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall
be granted.
(2) Existing uses. Before any existing use, structure, or tree may be replaced,
substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted,
within any Approach Surface Zone, Horizontal Surface Zone, Conical Surface
Zone or Transitional Surface Zone, a permit must be secured authorizing such
replacement, change or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would allow
the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air
navigation, than it was on the original effective date of this subsection, or than it is
when the application for a permit for replacement, change or repair of existing use,
structure, or tree shall be granted.
(I) Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted under paragraphs (G)
or (H) of this subsection may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the
purposes of this subsection and reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned
as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the City, at its own
expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be
necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

III. GDO, GATEWAY DESIGN OVERLAY DISTRICT.
(D) Design review process.
(1) Design development and review procedure. The design review process applies
to site plan development and building design and consists of four phases that
are to be conducted and coordinated with the Planning Department and Planning
Commission; and in GDO-3 the Administration Department. They are:
 Pre-Design Conference (to include Planning Staff and other staff as needed)
 Master Plan Review (to include Planning Staff, other staff as needed, and
Planning Commission)
 Initial Design Review (to include Planning Staff, other staff as needed, and
Planning Commission)
 Final Design Review (to include Planning Staff, other staff as needed, and
Planning Commission)
This process is intended to provide a basis for communication and to ensure that
the purposes and intents of this section are achieved throughout the entire design
and development process. Not all developments, particularly for site plans on
existing lots will require submittal of plans for all phases as outlined in this section
and this determination shall be made by the Planning Director during the predesign
conference. An applicant may submit master plan review and initial design
review materials simultaneously and request that they be reviewed concurrently. All
building construction and site improvements must be reviewed in accordance with
Section 7 of this article, the Citys Subdivision Regulations and other development
regulations of the City before any on-site construction commences. Prior to the
Planning Commission taking action when such action is required, plans must be
formally submitted to and reviewed by the Planning staff.
(a) New development. Any proposed improvement to any property within any
Gateway Design Overlay District requires submission to and approval in
accordance with the provisions of this article. Each phase of the process
has specific materials and information to be submitted by the applicant or
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:131
APPENDIX A - ZONING
designated agent. These materials will be necessary to adequately describe
the intent, extent and character of the proposed project. At each stage of review,
the reviewing body may approve a submission with or without conditions,
disapprove based on identified failure to conform to these GDO requirements,
defer pending additional information and/or on-site review, and/or require a resubmission
with changes.
(b) Modifications to existing buildings, structures and developments. The
GDO requirements shall be applicable to existing buildings, structures and
developments under the following circumstances:
[1] If an existing building or structure is expanded by fifty percent (50%) or
more in size, then the entire building or structure and site shall comply with
the requirements of this section.
[2] If the estimated cost of a renovation of an existing building, structure, or
development equals fifty percent (50%) or more of the total appraised value
of the existing building, structure, or development, then the entire building,
structure or development including the entire parking lot shall comply with
the requirements of this section.
[3] If there is a change in use of an existing building, structure or development,
which requires issuance of a special use permit, then the entire building,
structure, or development and site including parking area shall comply with
the requirements of this section.
[4] If there is change in use of an existing building, structure or development,
which requires rezoning of the property from one zoning district to another
zoning district, other than to or from a planned development district, to allow
the new use, then the entire building, structure, or development and site
including parking area shall comply with the requirements of this section.
[5] If the number of existing parking spaces for an existing building, structure or
development is expanded by twenty-five percent (25%) to forty nine percent
(49%), then the area of expansion shall comply with the requirements of this
section.
[6] If the number of existing parking spaces for an existing building, structure
or development is expanded by fifty percent (50%) or more, then the entire
parking lot shall comply with the requirements of this section.
[7] If a new and separate building, structure or development is constructed on
the same lot of record as an existing building, structure or development,
only the separate and new building, structure or development must meet
the requirements of this section. However, if the new building, structure or
development is connected physically to the existing building or structure so
as to make it appear the existing and new building or structure are part of
the same business or establishment, this exception shall not apply.
(c) Modifications or Alteration During Construction. Any modifications to or
deviations from approved plans, including landscape plans shall be submitted
for review by the Planning staff and the Urban Environmental Department staff
which shall evaluate the deviations to determine whether they are substantial
or minor deviations. If the deviations provide for less density than the approved
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:132
APPENDIX A - ZONING
plan; if it provides for greater open space by the elimination or reduction in the
size of buildings on the site; or if it modifies the orientation of buildings or their
location provided such changes do not significantly alter or adversely affect the
relationship of such buildings to the total development, any of its elements and
screening, or its relationship to adjacent rights of way then the deviations shall
be determined to be minor deviations.
[1] Minor deviations. If the Planning staff determines the modification or
alteration is a minor deviation from the approved plan, the Planning Staff shall
approve the revised plan and no application to the Planning Commission
shall be required.
[2] Substantial deviations. If the Planning staff determines the development plan
deviates substantially from the approved development plan, the applicant
shall apply for an amendment of the development plan as provided in this
section.
[3] Amendments. A development plan may be amended in accordance with
the procedure that governs its original approval as provided in this section.
[4] Landscape deviations. Any modifications to or deviations from approved
landscape plans shall be submitted for review by the Development
Services Division who shall evaluate the deviations to determine whether
the deviations require re-submittal and re-approval in accordance with the
requirements of Section 27(G) of this article.
(d) Variances. Variances from the provisions of this article shall be made in
accordance with Section 10 of this article.
Any submittal for which a variance from the GDO regulations may be requested
must include specific identification of the variance request and the reasons
therefore. It is the applicants responsibility to identify any item for such proposed
variances. Approval of an applicants final construction documents does not
constitute approval of a variance unless that variance has been specifically
requested in writing by the applicant, identified on the plans submitted for the
initial design review as described in this subsection, and specifically approved
in writing by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
Each applicant for a variance shall have the burden of proving that compliance
with these GDO standards would be extraordinarily difficult because of one or
more unusual characteristics of the property or because of characteristics of
the use that cause an unusual conflict with these regulations (e.g., vehicular
access into a building or drive-up windows for a bank). Generally such
characteristic may not have been created by deliberate action of the owner or
the owners representative. Each applicant for a variance must prove that an
alternative and equivalent means of compliance is not viable. In considering
a variance request, cost alone is not an extraordinary difficulty and it does not
justify granting a variance. Applicants not able to demonstrate an extraordinary
difficulty but whose plans are consistent with the intent and purposes of
this section are encouraged to pursue application for zoning as a planned

APPENDIX A - ZONING
development in accordance with the requirements and limitations of Section 13
of this article.
(2) Procedures for gateway design overlay review.
(a) Pre-design conference. Not more than six months prior to submitting plans for
development within the GDO, Gateway Design Overlay District, the applicant
shall request a pre-design conference with the Planning Director to evaluate
whether the applicant is proceeding under the proper section of this article; to
advise the Planning Director of the location, scope, and nature of the proposed
development; to clarify issues; to determine whether a master plan will be
required; and to discuss other matters as may be relevant to the design review
and approval process. This pre-application conference shall be attended by
the Planning Director; applicable City staff the Planning Director may determine
are needed to assist in the pre-design conference; and the applicant and/or the
applicants design team which may include professional engineers, architects,
landscape architects, or land planners retained by the applicant to assist in the
preparation of the development plans. In the event more than six months elapse
before plans are submitted for review in accordance with the requirements of
this section, the applicant shall request an additional pre-design conference.
The pre-design conference is an opportunity for an exchange of information
and ideas between the applicant, the design team, and the City Staff. The
applicant, along with applicants other appropriate consultants, may review
and clarify planning, engineering, master planning, design and development
criteria with the Planning staff. The conference is intended to establish the
compatibility of the proposed development with the Gateway Design Overlay
District regulations and whether the proposed development requires a change
in the underlying zoning or a variance from the GDO regulations. During the
conference, the applicant and design team are encouraged to discuss major
ideas, site elements, architectural design, and site development program
requirements with the Planning staff. Other topics for discussion should include
the characteristics of the particular site, technical issues related to review
procedures, stormwater management, ingress and egress, and proposed
on-site signage. Applicants are encouraged to discuss architectural design,
style, concept, and materials. The design team should bring to the pre-design
conference property surveys, conceptual site plans, conceptual subdivision
plats, preliminary elevations, and photographs or sketches of similar projects
done elsewhere.
The applicant must complete the following Project Information Form prior to
the pre-design conference and submit it along with a location map or aerial
photograph of the area under consideration to the Planning Director a minimum
of forty-eight hours in advance of the scheduled pre-design conference. The
pre-design conference will proceed generally as described on the Project
Information Form in the Outline For Pre-Design Conference.

(b) Master plan review. Based on the information discussed during the pre-design
conference the applicant shall submit a master plan of the development tract for
review by the Planning staff and the Planning Commission. If it is determined
by the Planning Director during the pre-design conference that a master plan
is not required because it is not necessary, then the applicant shall not be
required to submit a master plan as described in this sub-section.
The purpose of the master plan review is to assure the coordination of the
individual developments within the Gateway Design Overlay District particularly
in those instances when a development will involve multiple phases to be
developed over a period of time. Master plan review shall not constitute site
plan review or administrative site plan review as described in Section 7 of this
article nor shall it constitute preliminary or final plat submittal as described in
the Subdivision Regulations.
The master plan shall be drawn at a scale of no smaller than 1 = 200 on
sheets measuring no greater than 24 x 36. Use of plan sheets greater than
24 x 36 requires advance approval of the Planning Director. Ten copies of

APPENDIX A - ZONING
a state highway: A TDOT permit may be required. Evidence of TDOT approval
is required prior to the issuance of any building permits.
(4) The following standard note shall appear on all site plans that are not exempt
from providing a Stormwater Management Plan: A Stormwater Management
Plan demonstrating that the site provides for treatment of the water quality volume
and provides for management of the stream bank protection volume must be
provided.
(e) Construction notification and review. Prior to construction beginning on any site
within the GDO district, the owner, or owners authorized agent shall provide
the Development Services Division with seventy-two hours advance written
notice. The staff of the Development Services Division may conduct on-site
inspections as development and construction proceeds to monitor compliance
with these design regulations and to assure that the construction is proceeding
in accordance with the previously approved plans.
(3) Miscellaneous provisions.
(a) Administration. The provisions of this section shall be implemented by the Citys
Development Services Division and Public Works Division.
(b) As-built. As-built drawings of all utilities on the site including but not limited to
irrigation, water, sewer, gas, telephone, cable, and electric shall be provided to
the Development Services Division upon completion of the project prior to the
issuance of final certificates of occupancy.
(c) Accuracy of information. Any persons submitting plans to the City shall be
responsible for verification and accuracy of all components of such submissions,
including, without limitation, all site dimensions, grades, elevations, utility
locations and other pertinent features of the site or plans.
(d) Representation of applicants. The applicant represents, by the act of entering into
the design review process established by this section, that all representatives
of the applicant, including, but not limited to, applicants architect, engineer,
landscape architect, other design consultants, contractors, sub-contractors,
and their agents and employees, shall be made aware by the applicant of all
applicable requirements of the City and shall abide by these district regulations
with respect to approval of development plans and specifications.
(e) Regulatory compliance. Plans submitted for review in accordance with these
GDO overlay regulations must comply with all applicable building codes, other
zoning regulations and the requirements of all agencies having jurisdiction
over the project. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain all necessary
permits.
(E) Site planning and design.
(1) General approach. A sites natural assets and its relationship to its immediate
surroundings should have a significant influence on the site design and each
individually developed parcel or project within the Gateway Design Overlay
Districts should incorporate existing site specific characteristics such as vegetation,
topography, hydrology and views. Topography, vegetation and hydrology are
closely interrelated and have a direct effect on each other. Disruption to any one
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:153
APPENDIX A - ZONING
element will have repercussions to the others, which must be carefully considered.
(2) Views and Topography. Site planning and design must be sensitive to views, both
into and out of development parcels. Because viewsheds are directly related to the
topographic conditions and roadway alignments of a site, the impact of grades on
views should be considered to and from right-of-ways as well as adjacent properties.
The preservation and enhancement of desirable views should be realized through
sensitive and creative placement of all site elements on the site.
(3) Grading and drainage. Each site development will need to consider grading and
drainage in terms of preservation or creation of topographic features. The relation
of existing and proposed grades to wetlands, rivers or drainage ways, tree masses,
and stormwater detention areas as well as the relationship between buildings,
surface or structured parking, roads, service courts, and adjacent properties to
each other and to the site will have a significant influence on the success of the
development in terms of its overall impression and aesthetic appeal.
Stormwater will be detained in accordance with the standards for drainage design
and stormwater management of the City. Construction details, general concepts
and standards to be applied to drainage planning and design are an integral part
of these regulations. The design intent for treatment of stormwater drainage is
to preserve and enhance existing drainage ways. New drainage ways shall be
designed to appear natural and blend with the landscape. This includes the use of
broad, grassed swales, aesthetic stormwater quality facilities with very gentle side
slopes, the use of natural stone weirs, or the creation of naturalistic streambeds.
Headwalls and other drainage structures should be used sparingly. The sensitive
integration of these types of structures into the landscape setting will be a major
criteria used by the City in determining the appropriate and acceptability of design
proposals in this regard.
All development parcels shall consider and apply stormwater drainage techniques
that minimize culverts, underground structures, or other visually and environmentally
intrusive techniques in favor of a lower impact approach. No modification of
existing drainage ways shall be allowed without specific prior written consent of
the City Engineer.
Detention ponds and/or water quality facilities may be required and will be
preliminarily designed and coordinated at master plan stage. Such detention and
water quality facilities should be designed to serve multiple sites and should serve
as regional facilities to the extent possible. Detention and retention areas shall
be landscaped and screened by use of a combination of vegetation, earth berms,
walls, and/or other materials consistent with Section 27 of this article. Final design
of these elements will be required at Final Design Review stage.
(4) Circulation and parking. Plans for vehicular circulation and parking must consider
safety and aesthetic factors relative to the movement of vehicles. This includes
efforts to minimize conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians, to limit paved
areas, and to screen and soften the visual impact of parking areas, both interior
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:154
APPENDIX A - ZONING
and perimeter.
(a) Street design. A consistent streetscape treatment along public rights-of-way
enhances the appearance of the public domain and provides an attractive unified
setting for the variation among individual developments and sites. Landscaping
and building facades should dominate the public roadway frontage of any site.
Therefore, the following standards shall apply to streets constructed within the
Gateway Design Overlay District:
[1] Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of all streets. Sidewalks shall
be of similar material throughout the area of the Gateway Design Overlay
District in which they are located. Sidewalks shall be set back a minimum
of six feet behind the street curbs and shall be a minimum of five feet wide
unless otherwise required by the Gateway Streetscape Master Plan or with
the approval of the City Engineer.
[2] Sidewalks shall be developed to connect with adjacent properties and
developments in order to promote and reinforce pedestrian connectivity.
Sidewalks shall connect building entries within and between developments
and should connect the site to the public right of way.
[3] Unless otherwise required by the Gateway Streetscape Master Plan street
trees shall be installed in a planting zone a minimum of six feet wide located
between the back of the street curb and the sidewalk noted above. Said
trees may not be counted towards the minimum landscape requirements
and shall be in addition to any other trees required in this section or this
article. Street trees shall be large-maturity, canopy trees of a species
with a minimum caliper inch D.B.H. (diameter at breast height) of three
inches. A canopy tree shall be installed for every fifty linear feet of roadway
frontage and shall conform to the automotive sight triangle requirements
and specifications set forth in Section 27(P) of this article.
[4] When incorporated into the site, streetscape furnishings such as benches,
receptacles, light fixtures, bollards, etc. shall create a uniform theme
throughout the site. This entails the selection and specifications of products
based on a harmonious design and compatibility with the architecture of the
site and in conformance with standards adopted by the City.
[5] Site plans for properties along existing streets where there are no existing
sidewalks shall include sidewalks along the entire street frontage as part of
the site development.
(b) Surface parking. The design of surface parking shall be carefully considered to
minimize the visual impact on surrounding streets and developments. In order
to accomplish this, the following standards shall apply:
[1] number of parking spaces and size of spaces required shall meet the
requirements specified in Section 26 of this article;
[2] shared parking between developments shall be allowed and will be
encouraged for sites containing two or more buildings having complimentary
parking requirements. Shared accesses are encouraged between different
sites via cross access agreements. Approved shared parking or access
plans may allow waiver of other applicable design requirements, e.g.,
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:155
APPENDIX A - ZONING
subsection (4) below;
[3] minimum space between buildings and parking and/or access drives: ten
feet on lots of 1.5 acres or more and seven feet on lots of less than 1.5
acres; provided that the required minimum space shall not be required on
the side of a building that provides drive-thru pick-up windows or bank teller
drive-thru windows, or in front of vehicular access doors, loading docks, and
other such facilities;
[4] minimum space between parking and/or access drives and adjacent
property: fifteen feet on lots of 1.5 acres or more and ten feet on lots of less
than 1.5 acres;
[5] curbing (continuous concrete) required in all parking areas;
[6] tree quantities and sizes, buffering, and other planting requirements shall
meet those specified in Section 27 of this article; and,
[7] environmentally sensitive parking lot construction designs and methods
including but not limited to grass pavers, pervious pavers, and light colored
asphalt may be permitted upon approval by the City Engineer provided
the site architect or engineer can demonstrate their construction will be
satisfactory for the purpose to be served.
(c) Parking structures.
[1] exterior design shall be architecturally harmonious with the development;
[2] screening at perimeter of deck shall be provided at grade level so that
vehicles are screened;
[3] ramps leading into the parking garage shall be screened or buffered from
adjacent rights of way or sensitive view sheds; and,
[4] all parking spaces shall be delineated with painted lines.
(5) Natural vegetation areas. Efforts shall be made to maintain existing tree rows and
trees six inches in caliper or over. Clearing limit lines of natural areas and trees six
inches in caliper or over to be preserved shall be clearly delineated on all plans.
These areas shall require the following treatment:
(a) Trees or vegetative areas, which are to remain undisturbed, shall be protected
with a fence during the construction phase prior to the use of grading equipment.
(See Figure IV-1) Such fencing shall provide adequate protection for all trunks,
branches and root systems. Fencing shall not be removed until commencement
of landscape planting.
(b) When areas of natural vegetation occur within twenty feet of the point of
intersection of vehicular drives and streets, vehicular drives and pedestrian
walks or two or more drives or streets, the vegetation shall be limited to a height
not to exceed three feet, or in the case of trees, no branches below six feet.
(c) In general, areas of natural vegetation may be cleared of undergrowth.
(6) Historical features/areas. The City encourages the preservation of historical
features and recommends a coordination meeting with the Stones River National
Battlefield management to assist in the identification and location of historic features/
areas. It may be possible for these areas to be completely dedicated to the Stones
River National Battlefield for their ownership, responsibility of development, and
maintenance. Any such dedicated area can count toward meeting the maximum
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:156
APPENDIX A - ZONING
F.A.R. (floor area ratio) and maximum density, and may be credited toward open
space requirements with up to a 1/3 maximum credit.
(7) Reserved greenway areas. The City may be willing to accept existing natural
areas for City ownership, responsibility of development and maintenance. Said
areas would be utilized to link greenway systems together that would connect
to the existing Stones River Greenway in order to promote pedestrian friendly
connectivity, appropriate mixed use transition areas, and quality of life.
This dedicated area can count toward meeting the maximum floor area ratio
(F.A.R.), maximum density, and up to 1/3 of the required open space.
(8) Open space. Open space development is critical to creating a sense of place for
the Gateway Design Overlay District development. Consideration shall be given
by the individual developers of each site to develop a land plan that considers
creating open space that provides visual, aesthetic and environmental amenities
appropriate to the scale and character of the Gateway Design Overlay District. A
plan demonstrating conformance with the following minimum standards shall be
required:
(a) General requirements.
[1] a minimum of twenty percent (20%) open space shall be required on each
site;
[2] all landscape areas or natural areas greater than two hundred square feet
may constitute open space; and,
[3] phased developments shall provide the required minimum twenty percent
(20%) open space with each phase.
(b) Formal open space requirements. Each site shall be required to contain formal
open spaces which may be part of the open space required as described
above. Formal open space is defined as planned and structured areas,
including formally designed landscape areas, streetscape furnishings, plaza
areas, recreational improvements and street improvements. Following are
general requirements for these spaces.
[1] residential developments shall provide one or more formal open spaces
equal to five percent (5%) of the sites developable area. A minimum area
of five thousand square feet shall be required for any formal open space
and may include hardscape improvements, street furnishings and amenity
structures (i.e., gazebos, arbors, bandshells, etc.). However, individual lots
in a subdivision for single family residential lots shall not be required to
provide formal open space on each lot as described in this subsection; and,
[2] commercial/office developments, which exceed five acres or forty thousand
square feet of floor area, shall provide one or more formal open spaces
equal to three percent (3%) of the sites developable area and shall contain
no less than two thousand five hundred square feet.
(9) Pedestrian circulation. Pedestrian circulation systems shall promote free and safe
movement of pedestrians and bicyclists within each part of the Gateway Design
Overlay District and shall create an alternative transportation mode and open
space network throughout the entire Gateway Design Overlay District. A network
of walkways, paths or trails will ultimately link the various grounds and land uses of
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:157
APPENDIX A - ZONING
the Gateway Design Overlay District together, including connections with current
and future parts of the Murfreesboro Greenway system. All sites shall provide
pedestrian access from parking areas and public streets to building entries and
shall provide pedestrian access from the public right-of-way into the development
site.
Sidewalks along public streets shall conform to the requirements of the Gateway
Streetscape Master Plan or otherwise shall have a minimum unobstructed width
of five feet and be constructed in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations.
All sidewalks shall meet accessibility standards for disabled users as required by
appropriate government authorities. The Planning staff or Planning Commission
may require additional sidewalk widths when there are multiple users along the
sidewalks and the additional width is necessary to accommodate the additional
users. Sidewalk widths greater than the otherwise required minimums may be
required to accommodate multiple uses and expected high pedestrian usage.
(a) Single family and multifamily: sidewalks shall be required throughout singlefamily
subdivisions on both sides of all streets. Linkages of the sidewalk system
shall be provided to adjoining areas and to identifiable pedestrian destinations
and common areas.
(b) Multifamily development: shall incorporate pedestrian sidewalks and walkways
throughout, including links to the sidewalk system in public right-of-ways.
(c) Commercial: all commercial areas shall provide adequate pedestrian circulation
within and between individual developments and shall provide pedestrian
linkage to common areas.
(10) Building orientation. The orientation of buildings shall be considered an integral
and crucial part of the site planning process. Views to and from roadways,
surrounding parcels and significant existing or proposed site features should be
incorporated into the siting of building(s) to limit any potential negative impacts
while taking advantage of any benefits.
Site and building entries should be considered as a sequential experience that
is logical and easily understood by all. As appropriate, the separation of various
actions can add clarity to how efficiently a site works, as well as its aesthetic
impression. This type of approach may include separation of service, visitor, and
employee entries depending on the specific nature of the sites use. Service areas,
loading docks, and storage areas shall be incorporated into the building design
and oriented so that they are screened from adjacent right-of-ways and properties.
The existing and proposed topography of a site should have a direct impact on
building orientation and other site development elements, such as parking areas
and drives. Sensitivity to grading, significant stands of existing vegetation, and
drainage patterns are important in assuring that a site is developed in a manner
that minimizes negative impacts and blends the development with its site in a
harmonious manner.
General requirements for building orientation are:
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:158
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(a) Residential.
[1] the primary facades for all residential buildings, including single family and
multiple family buildings, shall front on a public street;
[2] the rear of buildings shall not face onto any street including Manson Pike,
Wilkinson Pike, Medical Center Parkway, Robert Rose Drive, Old Nashville
Highway, Fortress Blvd. and Thompson Lane unless the rear of the building
is screened with a minimum of a Type C buffer as described in Section 27
of this article;
[3] rear alleys will be considered as an alternative for garage and parking
access; and,
[4] standard building setbacks and heights for the underlying zoning district
shall apply provided that if these GDO regulations are more restrictive, the
GDO regulations shall apply and if the GDO regulations are less restrictive
the GDO regulations shall apply.
(b) Commercial.
[1] standard building setbacks and heights for the underlying zoning district
shall apply provided that if these GDO regulations are more restrictive, the
GDO regulations shall apply and if the GDO regulations are less restrictive
the GDO regulations shall apply; and,
[2] buildings are encouraged to be sited on internal streets rather than parking
lots so that parking does not dominate the streetscape.
(11) Site utilities. The utility appurtenances and mechanical equipment will be
considered as part of the overall site planning and design process in order to
incorporate these items in an acceptable manner. Evergreen planting, building
and equipment orientation, fencing, screening walls, grading and berming may
be used to mitigate the negative impacts of electrical transformer and telephone
switching boxes or any other utility or mechanical equipment to be located onsite.
Grouping these items together will usually make treatment more efficient and
effective. All utilities shall be underground.
(12) Site lighting. Exterior lighting is an essential part of the total design of all projects.
Well conceived lighting can extend the use of outdoor areas, create a sense of
well-being and add interest to the nighttime landscape.
Lighting should satisfy the objectives of security while creating a pleasing visual
environment. In an effort to reduce glare in the landscape, down lighting should
be emphasized while limiting the use of spotlights. Selective site and building
accent lighting is encouraged. For public protection and security, walkways and
parking areas, as well as non-defensible public space (i.e., hidden nooks, exterior
stairwells, dead end spaces) should be adequately lighted.
Lighting plans and schedules shall be provided in the initial design review. The
following considerations should be addressed during the review process:
(a) Lighting levels shall meet applicable standards for safety and security for
parking, pedestrian and service areas.
(b) All light sources for a project shall be coordinated, including consideration of
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:159
APPENDIX A - ZONING
adjacent light sources.
(c) All lighting fixtures shall be shielded to prevent glare. Light shall not be
distributed beyond an angle of thirty-five (35°) degrees from a vertical plane
onto surrounding properties.
(d) Lighting shall be designed so that illumination does not exceed one-half (1/2)
foot candle beyond the property line. All lighting shall have the intensities
and uniformity ratio consistent with the Lighting Handbook of the Illuminations
Engineering Society of North America (IESNA).
(e) On-site lighting fixtures in residential developments shall not exceed sixteen
feet in height. For nonresidential developments with structures thirty-five feet or
less in height, fixtures shall not exceed twenty feet in height. For nonresidential
developments with structures greater than thirty-five feet in height, fixtures shall
not exceed a height of thirty feet. Shoebox-style lighting fixtures shall not be
used for poles of sixteen feet or less in height. The pole or fixture height shall
include any base that it may be mounted upon.
(f) Poles may be located within landscaped areas or islands; however, to avoid
conflicts with required landscaping, poles shall not displace or conflict with
required parking lot landscaping.
(g) Attached building or wall pack lighting shall be screened by the buildings
architectural features or contain a thirty-five (35°) degree cutoff shield.
(h) Ground-oriented, pedestrian-scale lighting shall be considered as an alternative
to pole-mounted fixtures along pedestrian walkways.
(i) No lighting fixtures shall have blinking, flashing or fluttering lights or other
illuminating devices which have changing light intensity, brightness or color, nor
shall any beacon light be permitted, except those required for fire alarm and/or
emergency systems.
(j) White light shall be required. Metal halide, color-corrected mercury-vapor and
color-corrected high-pressure sodium lamps are permitted. Low-pressure
sodium lighting is prohibited.
(k) Fixtures used for architectural lighting, such as facade, feature, and landscape
lighting, shall be aimed or directed to preclude light projection beyond immediate
objects intended to be illuminated.
(l) Internally illuminated canopies shall have flush or recessed lenses.
(m) No glare shall project into public right-of-way.
(n) Lighting shall be sensitive to the Stones River National Battlefield to avoid
intrusions of lighting onto the land within its authorized boundary.
(o) All lighting fixtures and poles will be reviewed for aesthetic quality and
compatibility.
(F) Landscape development.
(1) Goals and objectives. The development of the site landscape is integral to the total
building design. It should respond to the architecture and reflect a relationship to
the site. The landscape design concept must accomplish the following aesthetic
and functional purposes:
(a) Reinforce the design objectives of the building. Articulation of main entries
should be emphasized and reinforced by creating a focal point with specimen
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:160
APPENDIX A - ZONING
plant material. Seasonal color can be considered wherever possible for special
interest areas.
(b) Screen (with evergreen plants) service areas, mechanical equipment, trash
containers, etc. from adjacent buildings.
(c) Integrate existing topography, as well as natural vegetation, to the landscape
design. Steep sites require special attention to prevent erosion and ease of
maintenance.
(d) Preserve desirable views while obtaining privacy.
(e) Long-term viability of landscape, ease of upkeep, disease resistance and
drought tolerance should be included in the selection criteria.
(2) Relationship with Section 27Landscaping and Screening. The provisions of this
section shall be required in addition to the provisions of Section 27 of this article as
regards landscaping, screening, and buffering. The provisions of Section 27 shall
apply except in instances where the provisions of this section are more stringent
or demanding.
(3) Requirements.
(a) Landscape plan. A separate landscape plan prepared in accordance with this
article shall be submitted and gain approval from the Development Services
Division prior to issuance of a building permit for any development within the
Gateway Design Overlay District. The provisions of this section shall be in
addition to the requirements of Section 27 of this article and where there is
conflict, the provisions of this section shall control.
(b) Irrigation. All landscape areas shall be irrigated with an automatic underground
irrigation system on lots of 1.5 acres or more. Developers and property owners
are encouraged to use repurified water for irrigation where it is available. Asbuilt
drawings of all irrigation systems shall be submitted by each owner or
related user upon completion of the installation of any such system. Permanent
irrigation need not be provided for areas to be maintained as existing natural
areas or areas to be restored as natural areas. However, temporary irrigation
systems may be required for reestablishment of such areas.
(c) Undeveloped areas. Undeveloped areas or portions of a parcel held in reserve
for future building(s) or pavement and which have been disturbed by land
development activities do not need to be fully landscaped or irrigated. Such
areas shall be seeded with a turf mix to minimize erosion and reduce weed
growth, and shall be properly maintained.
(d) Additional landscape requirements. In addition to parking lot screening
and buffer yard planting requirements, the following additional landscaping
requirements shall be met:
[1] Required front landscaping yard. Landscape areas are required adjacent
to and contiguous with all right-of-ways. The width of these landscape
areas shall be measured from the right-of-way and shall be dependent on
the roadway classification as determined by the Major Thoroughfare Plan
Roadway Classification Map as follows:
 Arterial = 25 foot width
 Collector = 20 foot width
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:161
APPENDIX A - ZONING
 Local = 15 foot width
[2] Required trees. The number and location of required perimeter trees shall
be determined based on the requirements of Section 27 of this article
provided, however, the following additional requirements shall be met to
determine the size and minimum number of required trees.
[aa] each newly developed site shall be required a minimum A.C.I.
(acquired caliper inch) of sixty caliper inches of proposed trees per acre
of development site. Trees in required buffer yards may not be counted
toward this requirement;
[bb] twenty percent (20%) of required trees shall be a minimum four caliper
inches in size;
[cc] twenty percent (20%) of required trees shall be a minimum three caliper
inches in size;
[dd] no proposed canopy, under-story, or ornamental tree planted with a
size less than two caliper inches shall be counted as a required tree;
[ee] a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) and maximum of forty percent
(40%) of required trees shall be under-story and/or ornamental trees;
and
[ff] multi-stem trees shall have a minimum cane size of ¾ caliper and have
sufficient canes to meet the required aggregate of 2 caliper inches.
[3] Required shrubs.
[aa] each newly developed site shall be required to be landscaped with
shrubs in accordance with the requirements of Section 27 of this article
provided, however, a minimum of thirty eighteen-inch shrubs per acre
shall be required for each site. Parking lot screening shall not be
counted toward this requirement unless the site is less than 1.5 acres in
size; and,
[bb] shrubs in required buffer yards shall not be counted toward this
requirement.
[4] Ground cover. Large areas with uninterrupted areas of gravel, pine straw
or bark mulch or bare soil are prohibited. Such areas shall be landscaped
with turf, seed, sod or groundcover.
[5] Street landscaping requirement. All streets shall be landscaped and irrigated
in accordance with Section (E)(4)(a) prior to the owner of the site adjacent
to the street occupying the site, provided, however, performance bonds may
be posted in accordance with the requirements of Section 27 of this article.
All areas, which have been landscaped and irrigated, shall continue to be
maintained by the site owner in accordance with the approved plan.
[6] Section 27(J)(3)(b) shall not apply within the GDO District.
[7] A five (5) foot minimum width landscape strip planted with shrubs, trees,
or other landscape materials in accordance with Section 27 of Appendix
A  Zoning shall be provided along the front and sides adjacent to the base
of the buildings or separated from buildings by a sidewalk. The landscape
area may be used for menu boards to the extent otherwise permitted by this
article and other regulations of the City.
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:162
APPENDIX A - ZONING
[8] The base of building landscaping requirement in subsection [7] above shall
not be required:
[aa] on the side of a building that provides drive-thru pick-up windows or
bank teller drive-thru windows, or
[bb] within five (5) feet of a pedestrian building entrance, a vehicular access
door, loading dock, or in such a manner as to block access to a door or
other building element requiring access.
(e) Parking areas.
[1] Landscape islands.
[aa] A landscape island shall be provided and constructed for every twelve
parking spaces in the manner illustrated in Figure V-1. Such islands
shall be a minimum of nine feet wide by eighteen feet long and shall not
count toward the required open space requirement unless they contain
a contiguous area of two hundred square feet. Landscape islands shall
be planted with one canopy tree per island and shall have the remaining
surface planted with appropriate turf, ground cover, or shrubs.
[bb] At least one canopy tree with a minimum three inch caliper shall be
placed in each island. (Note: These canopy trees can be used toward
the overall sixty inch A.C.I. per acre minimum requirement.)
[cc] The backfill material for landscape islands shall be free of asphaltic,
construction and/or trash materials. (See Figure V-2). The following
note is to be placed on all site plans: Note: No asphaltic, construction
trash and/or materials are to be left in the backfill and/or subgrade of any
proposed landscape parking area islands and/or planting strips.
[dd] Landscape islands shall not be used for parking lot lighting if such
lighting will displace or be in conflict with parking lot landscaping.
[2] Parking lot screening. All parking areas shall be screened and buffered
from public right-of-way by berms or planting or a combination thereof which
shall have a minimum height of three feet at the time of installation.
[3] Landscape parking island strip.
[aa] For every two hundred parking spaces a maximum of one twenty foot
wide landscape strip that runs the length of the parking bay shall be
provided to divide the parking spaces into sub parking lots. (See Figure
V-3).
[bb] The backfill material for such twenty foot strip is to be free of asphaltic,
construction and/or materials. (See Figure V-2).
[cc] For every forty L.F. of planting strip, one - three inch caliper shade
tree shall be planted plus one  twenty-four inch high shrub for every
one hundred S.F. of planting strip area. Plantings shall consist of fifty
percent (50%) evergreen shrubs. Shrubs and trees shall count toward
the minimum shrub and tree requirements.
(f) Landscape screening. Landscape screening shall conform to the requirements
of Section 27 of this article. All utility boxes, service areas, mechanical
equipment, trash containers, dumpsters, and similar unaesthetic site elements
shall be screened with the use of appropriate plant material, fences or walls,

(1) General character. The architectural design concepts are based on a comprehensive
approach to development, with respect to the intended character and integrity of
existing site features. Architectural character is an important part of the image
conveyed by the various aspects of the Gateway Design Overlay District. To
produce an orderly and aesthetically pleasing environment of high architectural
quality; architectural treatments and character must be approved by the City by
way of the design review process prior to any issuance of building permits or project
construction. A buildings exterior architectural expression and design compatibility
with neighboring projects are the primary concern of this section. Size, massing,
spatial relationships, organization, architectural style, detail, color and material will
be among the criteria used for evaluation. Appropriate architectural design shall:
(a) Provide an appropriate level of interest in the roofline.
(b) Relate the buildings features or articulation to the assets of the site.
(c) Emphasize architectural detailing for curb appeal and positive visual impact
especially related to entrances.

of the GDO district.
(e) Include a heavy reliance on masonry materials as a building material for exterior
elements.
(2) Building construction and design. Building construction and design shall be used
to create a structure with attractive, high quality exterior elevations on all sides.
Accessory buildings and enclosures, as well as other site elements, whether
attached to or detached from the main building, shall be of similar compatible
design and materials.

with the overall Gateway Design Overlay District purposes and intent, as described
throughout these regulations, as well as the design of neighboring structures and
parcels. Large, uninterrupted expanses of a single material are discouraged.
Long, uninterrupted building planes are not recommended. Buildings should be
designed and arranged with offsetting surfaces and planes to provide a varied
street appearance. A heavy reliance on masonry materials for all structures is
encouraged.

(a) Rooftops. All penetrations through the roof (for example, mechanical equipment
or skylights) must be organized in a manner that is integral to the architectural
form of the building.
To ensure the preservation of views, all rooftop surface material, texture,
equipment and accessories shall be reviewed according to the following
regulations:
[1] Roof-mounted mechanical equipment, vents and stacks shall be minimized
and eliminated where possible. Equipment should be consolidated to be
located within the same screened area.
[2] Exposed ductwork, pipes, conduit, fans, vents or other similar building
elements shall be screened from the view at pedestrian level from all public
roadways and vehicular access ways.
[3] Mechanical, utilities or other building elements that must be roof mounted

ARTICLE V. PS, PLANNED SIGNAGE OVERLAY DISTRICT
(A) Intent and purpose. The purposes of these Planned Signage Overlay District
regulations include:
(1) To promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, and convenience.
(2) To permit the use of new and innovative signs on large, atypical developments.
(3) To encourage the design and development of signage that is of higher quality than
is customary under the signage regulations otherwise applicable.
(4) To promote aesthetic and architectural improvements in the total planning of large
land tracts.
(5) To promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings.
(6) To enhance the economy and business and industry of the City by promoting welldesigned
developments.
(7) To recognize the benefits afforded by the coordination of signage between multiple
users of large developments.
(8) To provide an option to the existing sign ordinance.
(B) Eligibility for Planned Signage Overlay District. A Planned Signage Overlay District
will only be considered for developments of twenty (20) acres or more in size. If the
land for which this zoning is requested is not owned by one owner, all owners must
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:172
APPENDIX A - ZONING
sign the application and, as a part of that application, must indicate their agreement
that one person has authority to act on behalf of all owners and must name that
person. For purposes of this section, the holder of a written option to purchase may
also be considered an owner. Unless otherwise provided as a condition of approval
of a Planned Signage Overlay District, the owner may divide and transfer parts of
the tract to others after the District is approved provided that all transferees shall be
obligated to use and maintain it in strict conformity with the approved Master Signage
Plan and any other terms and conditions of the District zoning.
(C) Eligible Zone. An application for a Planned Signage Overlay District may be submitted
by an owner if the development is zoned Highway Commercial (CH), any industrial
zone, or as a Planned Development; if it is located in any of the Gateway Design

deviations to determine whether they are substantial or minor. The deviation will be
deemed minor and may be approved administratively if:
(1) it provides for fewer or smaller signs than the approved Master Signage Plan; or
(2) it modifies the orientation of signs or their location as long as such changes do
not significantly alter or adversely affect the relationship of such signs to the total
development or any of its elements.

Ordinance be declared to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect
the validity by a court of competent jurisdiction of the Planned Signage Overlay District
Ordinance, or the Zoning Ordinances or the Sign Ordinances of the City, as a whole
or any part thereof other than the part declared to be unconstitutional or invalid, each
article, section, clause and provision being declared severable.

components, the applicant shall provide an alternative planting arrangement
that satisfies the minimum planting requirements set forth in this section. The
Development Services Division in consultation with the Public Works Division
shall have the authority to collect a payment in lieu of installation in cases where
the City deems immediate installation impractical or undesirable.
(F) Landscaping, screening, and buffering requirements. Properties with underlying CBD
(Central Business District) zoning shall be exempt from the landscaping, screening,

CCO district, landscaping shall be required as provided in Section 27 of this Article;
provided, however, within the CCO district subsections Section 27 (C)(3), (J), (K), and
(L) shall not apply and instead the following subsection shall apply:
(1) Changes to existing buildings, structures and developments. The requirements of
this section shall be applicable to existing buildings, structures, and developments
under the following circumstances:
(a) if an existing building, structure or development is expanded by seventy-?ve
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:180
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(75) percent or more, then the entire building, structure or development shall
comply with the requirements of this subsection;
(b) if the estimated cost of a renovation of an existing building, structure, or
development equals seventy-?ve (75) percent or more of the total appraised
value of the existing building, structure, or development (including land), then
the entire building, structure or development including parking area shall comply
with the requirements of this subsection;
(c) if there is a change in use of an existing building, structure or development,
then the entire building, structure, or development including parking area shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this subsection;
(d) if there is a change in use of an existing building, structure or development
from a residential use to a nonresidential use then the entire building, structure,
or development including parking area shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this subsection; or,
(e) if the number of parking spaces for an existing building, structure or development
is expanded by ?fty percent (50%) or more, or the area of the parking lot is
expanded by ?fty percent (50%) or more, then the area of expansion shall
comply with the requirements of this subsection.
(2) Alternative landscaping arrangements. For projects being reviewed administratively,
the Planning Director shall have the authority to permit an alternative landscaping
arrangement where such an arrangement provides at least the minimum number of
plantings specified in this section and satisfies the intent of this article. For projects
requiring Planning Commission review and approval, the Planning Commission
shall have the authority to permit such an alternative landscaping arrangement.
(3) Required perimeter landscaping. Perimeter landscaping yards shall be required
around all properties in the CCO district except properties with underlying CBD
zoning and other properties with buildings constructed to the edge of the sidewalk
or property line(s). In cases where a building has been constructed to less than
all of the property lines, perimeter landscaping yards shall be installed along the
remaining boundaries of the site where practical. A perimeter landscaping yard
shall have a minimum width of:
(a) five (5) feet on a front planting yard and three (3) feet on other planting yards
where the site is two (2) acres or less; or
(b) eight (8) feet on a front planting yard and five (5) feet on other planting yards
where the site is greater than two (2) acres.
(4) Shared planting yards. Along a side or rear property line, the requirement for
perimeter landscaping may be satis?ed by the creation and maintenance of a
single planting yard with the adjacent property owner. The number of trees shall be
the same as required as if it was only one perimeter landscaping for the common
planting yard. Both property owners shall present and execute an enforceable
written agreement for the perpetual maintenance of the planting yard and record it
in the Rutherford County Register of Deeds of?ce at no expense to the City. The
agreement shall be binding on any successor owner of either property.
(5) Specifications for planting yards. Unless otherwise specified in this subsection,
the following specifications shall apply to planting yards in the CCO district:
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:181
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(a) Planting yards shall contain one shade tree every fifty (50) linear feet, excluding
any vehicular access way. Ornamental trees may be substituted for up to sixty
percent (60%) of otherwise required shade trees. Ornamental trees shall be
planted not more than thirty (30) linear feet from another tree. Only ornamental
trees may be planted under overhead utility lines. These trees shall be generally
equally distributed along the property lines, but they are not required to be
at absolute equal intervals. This will allow for some ?exibility in design while
discouraging long intervals without trees.
(b) Lots within the CCO district having one hundred and fifty (150) linear feet or
less of lot frontage may also meet the requirement for perimeter landscaping
in front planting yards as speci?ed below. Shrubs required to be planted within
a front planting yard under this provision may be planted anywhere within the
front planting yard and may be mass planted to achieve a more naturalistic
appearance. Ground cover is not considered a shrub. Shrubs shall be of at
least two different types (small, medium, or large being the types) and at least
?fty percent (50%) of the shrubs shall be evergreen. The shrubs shall have
a minimum height of eighteen (18) inches from ground level at the time of
planting.
[1] With a ?ve (5) foot front planting yard, no trees are required, but one shrub
is required for every twelve and one-half (12.5) square feet of planting yard.
[2] With an eight (8) foot front planting yard, one (1) shade tree or (2) two
ornamental trees are required, and one shrub is required for every ten (10)
square feet of planting yard.
(6) Diversity of species. No one tree species shall comprise more than sixty (60)
percent of the total number of trees. This provision is still met if an uneven number
of trees is required and there is one tree more than sixty (60) percent of a given
species.
(7) Distance between planting yard and right-of-way. All trees in a planting yard shall
be planted no closer than two and one half (2.5) feet from any public right-ofway
unless such planting yard is less than ?ve (5) feet wide, in which event care
shall be taken to avoid damage to trees from automobiles that may overhang the
planting yard.
(8) Landscape requirements for new parking lots.
(a) Off-street parking areas with multiple access aisles shall be designed and
constructed with landscape islands dividing at least every twelve (12) parking
spaces in a row. Such islands shall have a minimum width of eight (8) feet and
shall have a minimum depth equal to the depth of the adjacent parking stall(s).
In addition to being designed with landscape islands dividing the rows, large
parking areas with multiple rows of parking aisles shall be divided into sub-lots
(sub-areas) containing no more than thirty-six spaces along either side of an
aisle. Such sub-lots shall be divided by cross-access aisles allowing for cross
circulation between aisles. The minimum width of such cross- access aisles
shall be twenty-two (22) feet.
(b) All landscape islands shall be designed and constructed to include continuous
curbing around their perimeter and shall be back?lled with topsoil to a depth of
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:182
APPENDIX A - ZONING
thirty (30) inches and shall be free of rock, debris, inorganic compositions, and
chemical residues detrimental to plant life. All such landscape islands shall be
planted with shade trees or, in appropriate circumstances, ornamental trees.
(c) The stormwater drainage plan and landscaping plan shall be coordinated so
the landscaping plan enhances stormwater drainage.
(9) Base of building landscaping requirements. The following base of building
landscape requirements shall apply to all nonresidential buildings, single-family
attached buildings, and multi-family residential buildings consisting of three or
more dwelling units.
(a) A three (3) foot minimum width landscape strip shall be provided along the front
and sides adjacent to the base of buildings or separated from the building by
a sidewalk. Such strip shall be planted with shrubs, trees, or other landscape
materials. However, no such landscape strip shall be required within ?ve (5)
feet of a building entrance or in such a manner as to block access to a door or
other signi?cant building element or within an area used for outdoor seating
for a restaurant use.
(b) The base of building landscaping requirement shall not apply to maneuvering
areas and loading areas that are not visible from a public right-of-way or to land
zoned H-I (Heavy Industrial), G-I (General Industrial), or L-I (Light Industrial)
when such land is developed with a use identi?ed as Industrial in Chart 1 of
this Article.
(c) The base of building landscaping requirement shall not be required if it will
cause the width of an access drive to the rear of a property to be reduced to
less than twenty-two (22) feet.
(d) Base of building plantings shall not be required for structures built to the edge
of a sidewalk or a property line.
(10) Screening requirements. Service areas, mechanical equipment, trash containers,
dumpsters, and similar unaesthetic site elements shall be screened with the use of
plant material, fences, or walls to reduce potential negative impacts. Stormwater
management areas including detention or retention areas shall be landscaped.
Such areas may be planted in a manner conducive to stormwater management
with appropriate vegetation upon approval by the City Engineer.

Section 27. Landscaping and Screening.
(A) Purpose and scope. It is the intent of the City of Murfreesboro to promote the health,
safety and welfare of existing and future residents by establishing minimum standards
for the protection of natural plant communities and features, and for the planting and
continued maintenance of installed landscaping, within the City in order to:
(1) Environmental quality: Improve environmental quality by recognizing the numerous
beneficial effects of landscaping upon the environment, including:
(a) improving the air and water quality through such natural processes as
photosynthesis, mineral uptake and chemical conversions that will help promote
oxygen production, carbon dioxide reduction and greenhouse effect mitigation;
(b) maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management,
aquifer recharge and the conservation of fresh water resources;
(c) reducing and reversing air, noise, heat and chemical pollution through the
biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation;
(d) promoting energy conservation through the creation of shade and reducing
heat gain in or on buildings or paved areas;
(e) providing habitat for urban wildlife,
(f) reducing the temperature of the microclimate through the process of
evapotranspiration; and,
(g) encouraging the conservation of topsoil resources through the use of site
specific plants and various planting and maintenance techniques to prevent
erosion.
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:210
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(2) Land values: Maintain and increase the value of land by requiring a minimum
amount of landscaping to be incorporated into development, thus improving its
value as a capital asset.
(3) Human values: Provide direct and important physical and psychological benefits
to human beings through the use of landscaping to reduce noise and glare, and
to break up the monotony and soften the harsher aspects of urban development.
To provide a sense of countryside and nature in the City thereby promoting a
psychological sense of place for citizens and visitors alike.
(4) Conserve water: Promote the conservation of potable and non-potable water
by encouraging the preservation of existing plant communities, encouraging the
planting of natural or uncultivated areas, encouraging the use of site specific plant
materials, providing for natural water recharge preventing excess runoff, mitigating
flood impacts down stream, and establishing techniques for the installation and
maintenance of landscape materials and irrigation systems.
(5) Aesthetics: Improve the aesthetic appearance of commercial, industrial, and
public areas through landscape design which incorporates living plant material,
appropriate non-living landscape materials and other site elements in open space
development in ways that harmonize and enhance natural and built environments
in a way that is conducive to economic development.
(6) Preservation and addition of vegetation: Preserve existing natural vegetation and
encourage the incorporation of plant materials, especially native plants, plant
communities and ecosystems into landscape design, where possible.
(7) Improved community design: Promote innovative and cost-conscious approaches
to the design, installation and maintenance of landscaping.
(B) Responsibility.
(1) The owner as defined in this section is solely responsible to the City for compliance
with the provisions of this section.
(2) The contractor or landscape installer and the owner are responsible for submitting
a landscape certificate of compliance as described in subsection (S) below before
a final inspection will be conducted.
(C) Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all uses, except single family
and duplex dwellings.
(1) New developments: No new building, structure or development shall hereafter be
constructed, or parking area created, unless landscaping is provided as required
by this section.
(2) CBD exemption: The provisions of this section shall not apply to any building,
structure, or use located in the CBD zoning district.
(3) Changes to existing buildings, structures and developments: The requirements of
this section shall be applicable to existing buildings, structures and developments
under the following circumstances:
(a) if an existing building, structure or development is expanded by fifty percent
(50%) or more, then the entire building, structure or development shall comply
with the requirements of this section;
(b) if the estimated cost of a renovation of an existing building, structure, or
development equals fifty percent (50%) or more of the total assessed value of
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:211
APPENDIX A - ZONING
the existing building, structure, or development (including land), then the entire
building, structure or development including parking area shall comply with the
requirements of this section;
(c) if there is change in use of an existing building, structure or development which
requires issuance of a special use permit, then the entire building, structure, or
development including parking area shall comply with the requirements of this
section;
(d) if there is change in use of an existing building, structure or development, which
requires rezoning of the property from one zoning district to another zoning
district, other than to or from a planned development district, to allow the new
use, then the entire building, structure, or development including parking area
shall comply with the requirements of this section;
(e) if the number of existing parking spaces for an existing building, structure or
development is expanded by twenty-five percent (25%) to forty-nine percent
(49%), then the area of expansion shall comply with the requirements of this
section;
(f) if the number of existing parking spaces for an existing building, structure or
development is expanded by fifty percent (50%) or more, then the entire parking
lot shall comply with the requirements of this section; or,
(g) if a new and separate building, structure or development is constructed on
the same lot of record as an existing building, structure or development,
only the separate and new building, structure or development must meet
the requirements of this section. However, if the new building, structure or
development is connected physically to the existing building or structure so
as to make it appear the existing and new building or structure are part of the
same business or establishment, this exception shall not apply.
(D) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to the regulation and control of
landscaping within this article in addition to those definitions in section 2.

insure that the required site work will be performed completely and correctly within
a certain time frame. This bond shall be in the form of a cashiers check, letter of
credit from a banking institution, certificate of deposit, or performance bond from
an insurance company. The posting of a bond satisfactory to the City will be a
condition for the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy.
(4) Buffering: The use of landscaping (other than mere grass on flat terrain), or the
use of landscaping with berms, walls, or decorative fences, that at least partially
obstructs the view from the street or adjoining properties of vehicular use areas,
parking lots and their parked cars, loading areas, and refuse containers.
(5) Buffer zone: The required installation of landscaping between land uses. (See
subsection (L) for further explanation.)
(a) Type A buffer zone: A planting strip having a minimum width of ten feet which is

UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:215
APPENDIX A - ZONING
and approved, provided, however, that a grading and/or a foundation building permit
may be issued upon the approval of the Planning Director or designee and the Chief
Building Official or designee but any such grading or foundation building permit
issuance shall be at the risk of the applicant and does not constitute site plan approval.
(F) Landscape Plan Requirements. A separate landscape plan must be submitted;
provided that, if the site plan is for a building of less than fifteen thousand square
feet, and is on a lot of less than two acres, then the landscape plan may be combined

as to location that may be required under Chapter 25.2.);
18. ______ Connections to existing streets; and,
19. ______ Zoning designation of the subject property and the adjacent
properties.
(G) Changes and Resubmittals. A change to a previously approved landscape plan
requires resubmittal and reapproval before the installation of plant materials. Such
changes may occur as a result of, but are not limited to a:
(1) reduction in the quantity of required landscape materials;
(2) reduction in the size of plant materials (if adding larger plant materials of the same
category, resubmittal and reapproval are not necessary);
(3) change in location of plant materials (no revisions are necessary if minor field
adjustments, not to exceed three feet, must occur);
(4) change in design, layout or location of design elements such as: earth berms,
buffer zones, walls, fences etc.;
(5) change in location of overhead or underground utilities; or,
(6) change in appropriateness of plant materials upon maturity.
Changes to a previously approved landscape plan will not require resubmittal and
reapproval before the installation of plant materials if such changes occur as a
result of change in species due to lack of plant availability. However, the new plants
must be of the same general category, i.e. shade tree, ornamental tree, evergreen
tree, deciduous shrub, or evergreen shrub, and shall maintain the same general
design characteristics, such as form, mature height, crown spread and intent, as
the plants on the originally approved landscape plan.
(H) Landscape Requirements.
(1) To be approved by the Development Services Division, a landscape plan submitted
under subsection (E) must comply with the landscape requirements of this section.
These landscape requirements include subsections (I), (J), (K), (L), (M), and (N).
(2) If application of these landscape requirements to a particular lot would be
unreasonable or impractical, or would damage or eliminate existing vegetation, a
subsection (F) landscape plan may be submitted with a request for approval of an
alternate and equivalent means of providing landscaping. The need for alternative
means of landscaping might arise from unusual site conditions, including streams,
natural rock formations or topography; or from an unusual lot configuration or
development design; or, from the presence of utility easements. The request for
approval of an alternative to the landscape requirements must specify the reason
for requesting the alternative and the landscape plan must demonstrate the
equivalency of the proposed alternative to the requirements. The Development
Services Division will determine if the proposed alternative is equivalent and
whether it meets the intent and purpose of this section. This determination may
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:218
APPENDIX A - ZONING
take into account the land use classification of adjacent properties; the number
of plantings, species, arrangement and coverage proposed; the location of the
plantings on the lot; and the level of screening, height, spread, and canopy of the
plantings at maturity.
(3) If, for the same reasons an alternative plan is necessary, an applicant is unable to
achieve the required number of trees on a proposed alternative plan, the applicant
may achieve the necessary equivalency by making a commitment to the Citys tree
bank. This provision is not intended to allow an applicant to avoid the minimum
landscaping requirements if compliance is feasible. The commitment shall be in
an amount equal to the number of omitted trees multiplied by the tree replacement
rate unless, based on the alternative landscape plan proposed, the Development
Services Division, determines that a lesser commitment amount would be sufficient
to achieve equivalency. The City Council shall approve and, from time to time,
adjust the tree replacement rate; it shall be the dollar amount deemed equivalent to
the cost of purchasing, planting and maintaining a required tree as recommended
by the Development Services Division. The commitment to the tree bank shall
be paid when the building permit is issued. Payments received by the tree bank
shall be used solely to landscape public properties and rights of way. Landscaping
improvements made using funds from the tree bank shall be designed to achieve
the purposes and goals of Section 27(A).
(I) Landscape standards and specifications.
(1) The owner shall furnish and install all plant materials listed on the approved plant
schedule.
(2) Plant materials shall conform to the requirements described in the latest edition of
the American Standard for Nursery Stock, published by the American Association
of Nurserymen.
(3) At the time of planting, shade trees must be a minimum of two and one-half (2½)
inches in caliper, ornamental trees must be a minimum of one and one-half (1½)
inches in caliper and evergreen trees must be a minimum of six feet tall.
(4) At the time of planting, when planted as part of a required buffer zone, small shrubs
must have a minimum height of eighteen inches, medium shrubs must have a
minimum height of two feet, and large shrubs must have a minimum height of three
feet.
(5) If staking materials are used, then the owner should, for reasons of tree health and
longevity, remove them after one growing season.
(6) The Public Works Division may be consulted to determine the proper time to move
and install plant material so that stress to the plants is minimized. All planting must
be completed by the next planting season not to exceed six months time after the
temporary certificate of occupancy is issued.
(7) The owner shall ensure that all planting areas, e.g. tree pits, hedge trenches and
shrub beds, are excavated appropriately. All pits shall be generally circular in
outline, with vertical sides. The tree pit shall be deep enough to allow one-eighth
(1/8) of the ball to be above existing grade. Soil within the planting areas should
be reasonably free of rock, debris, inorganic compositions and chemical residues
detrimental to plant life. Plants shall rest on a well-compacted surface.
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:219
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(8) Existing trees shall be preserved whenever feasible (see subsection (Q)).
(9) All planting areas shall be mulched with a three to four inch layer of bark, pine
needles, or other similar material to cover the complete planting area, and other
areas shall be in grass or ground cover.
(10) No plantings of trees are allowed within a dedicated drainage easement without
the written consent of the City Engineer. No plantings of trees are allowed within
any recorded sewer or water easement without the written consent of the Director
of the Water Resources Department. The owner must submit an agreement to
landscape in City easement as described in subsection (W). Plantings of items
other than trees within a dedicated drainage easement or a recorded sewer or
water easement shall be at the owners risk and shall not waive or modify the
easement.
(11) Landscape plans shall not include any tree on the do not plant tree list. This list
shall be compiled by the Public Works Division and maintained on file with City
Recorder.
(12) When stormwater management facilities are co-located within areas also used for
the required or optional landscaping, the stormwater management facility must be
located, designed, constructed, and operated in such a manner as to not interfere
with the landscape required or placed on the site.
(13) When stormwater management facilities are required on-site, the landscape plan
shall include proper treatment of the stormwater management facilities so that
the overall site landscaping and the landscaping of the stormwater management
facility are complementary.
(14) Landscape plans shall incorporate all specifications as provided on the City of
Murfreesboro Standard Tree Specifications list established by the Development
Services Division and the Public Works Division.
(J) Required perimeter landscaping. An owner is required to have planting yards around
the perimeter of a property except where vehicular access ways are provided. A
planting yard shall be a uniform minimum width of: (i) five feet where the site is one
acre or less; (ii) eight feet on a front planting yard and five feet on other planting yards
where the site is between one and two acres; (iii) eight feet where the site is more than
two acres and less than five acres or more; or, (iv) ten feet where the site is five acres
or more. The width of the planting yard shall not affect any other requirement of this
section.
(1) Planting yards shall be placed along the front, side and rear property lines except
where access ways are provided or where a building is built up to the side or rear
lot line. If there is less than five feet, between the building and the side or rear lot
line, shrubs and/or small ornamental trees shall be planted and maintained. If
there is more than five feet between the building and the side or rear lot line, the
planting requirements for planting yards shall be applicable. A property bound by
two or more public rights-of-way has two or more front yards.
(2) Along a side or rear property line, this requirement for perimeter landscaping may
be satisfied by the creation and maintenance of a single planting yard with the
adjacent property owner. A planting yard used to meet the perimeter landscaping
requirements for two properties must have a uniform minimum width of ten feet and
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:220
APPENDIX A - ZONING
the number of trees shall be the same as required as if it was only one perimeter
landscaping for the common planting yard. Both property owners must present
and execute an enforceable written agreement for the perpetual maintenance of
the planting yard and record it in the Register of Deeds office, all at no expense
to the City, which agreement shall be binding on any successor owner of either
property. No such shared planting yard shall be used to reduce the buffer zone
requirement contained in subsection (L).
(3)(a) Planting yards shall contain one shade tree every forty linear feet, excluding
any vehicular access way. Ornamental trees may be substituted for up to
forty percent (40%) of otherwise required shade trees. Ornamental trees
shall be planted not more than twenty-five linear feet from another tree. Only
ornamental trees may be planted under overhead utility lines. These trees
shall be generally equally distributed along the property lines, but they are not
required to be at absolutely equal intervals. This will allow for some flexibility in
design while discouraging long intervals without trees. To increase viewsheds
to the building(s) and/or sign(s), the owner may submit an alternate plan under
subsection (H)(2) to provide for an alternate arrangement of trees within the
planting yard.
(b) Owners of lots with limited street frontage may also meet the requirement
for perimeter landscaping in front planting yards as specified below. Shrubs
required to be planted within a front planting yard under this provision may
be planted anywhere within the front planting yard and may be mass planted
to achieve a more naturalistic appearance; ground cover is not considered
a shrub. Shrubs shall be of at least two different types (small, medium or
large being the types) and at least fifty percent (50%) of the shrubs shall be
evergreen. The shrubs shall have a minimum height of twenty-four inches from
ground level at the time of planting.
[1] one hundred fifty linear feet or less of lot frontage:
 with a five foot front planting yard, no trees are required but one shrub is
required for every twelve and five tenths square feet of planting yard;
 with an eight foot front planting yard, one shade tree or two ornamental
trees are required and one shrub is required for every twenty square feet
of planting yard.
[2] two hundred fifty linear feet or less, but more than one hundred fifty linear
feet, of lot frontage:
 with a five foot front planting yard, one shade tree or two ornamental
trees are required and one shrub is required for every twelve and five
tenths square feet of planting yard;
 with an eight foot front planting yard, two shade trees or four ornamental
trees are required and one shrub is required for every twenty square feet
of planting yard.
[3] three hundred fifty linear feet or less, but more than two hundred fifty linear
feet, of lot frontage:
 with a five foot front planting yard, two shade trees or four ornamental
trees are required and one shrub is required for every twelve and five
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:221
APPENDIX A - ZONING
tenths square feet of planting yard;
 with an eight foot front planting yard, three shade trees or six ornamental
trees are required and one shrub is required for every twenty square feet
of planting yard.
A front planting yard planted in accordance with this subsection [2] is not subject to
the provisions of subsection (6).
(4) No one tree species shall comprise more than sixty percent (60%) of the total
number of trees provided however that this provision is still met if an uneven
number of trees is required and there is one tree more than sixty percent (60%) of
a given species.
(5) All trees in a planting yard shall be planted no closer than two and one half (2½)
feet from any public right-of-way.
(6) A front planting yard shall contain a number of shrubs equal to one shrub for five
linear feet of frontage. These required shrubs may be small, medium, or large.
They may be planted anywhere within a front planting yard and may be mass
planted to achieve a more naturalistic appearance. Up to fifty percent (50%) of
the required number of shrubs for a front planting yard may be located in the
immediate vicinity of the building, structure or development.
(7) If any landscaping required by this subsection is set back from any lot line, the area
between the lot line and the landscaping shall be landscaped with grass or other
appropriate plants, except for sidewalks.
(8) For reasons of safety and security, this subsection shall not require the placement
of a tree, shrub or bush within twenty feet of a door to a building or structure when
it could reasonably create a security risk but this shall not reduce the number of
trees required.
(9) In the case of a group development where out-parcels of the same zoning
classification exist, the outer boundaries shall be landscaped according to all
landscape requirements. The interior boundaries abutting undeveloped outparcels
are not required to be landscaped initially but such out-parcels within the
group development must comply with all the landscape requirements at the time of
their development.
(K) Required landscaping within parking lots and around base of buildings. Parking lots
should be effectively landscaped with trees and shrubs to reduce the visual impact
of glare, headlights, and parking lot lights, to delineate driving lanes, aid the control
of stormwater runoff, and to define rows of parking; parking lots should be shaded
in order to reduce the amount of reflected heat. Landscaping to include shrubs and
ornamental trees should be planted at the base of buildings as foundation plantings
to aid in stormwater control, reduce the amount of reflected heat, identify significant
entries into buildings, and to screen unsightly elements of the building.
(1) Landscape requirements for new parking lots:
(a) Off-street parking and other vehicular use areas shall be designed and constructed
using the design standards in this subsection for landscape islands and shall
also be designed and constructed so that not less than four percent (4%) of any
parking area of two acres or more in size, and six percent (6%) of any parking
area of five acres or more in size, is used for landscaping. In calculating area size
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:222
APPENDIX A - ZONING
for this minimum use percentage, landscaped areas used for required perimeter
landscaping and buffer zones shall not be included, nor shall any loading area to
the rear of a building used exclusively for deliveries be included. Any landscaped
area which is immediately adjacent to off-street parking and vehicular use
areas and which is not required perimeter landscaping may be used to satisfy
the minimum landscaping percentage of this subsection. The off-street parking
and other vehicular use area shall consist of all paved areas inside the edge of
perimeter landscaping, including access ways.
(b) Off-street parking areas with a single access aisle shall be designed and
constructed with landscape islands dividing rows of parking spaces such that
no more than twenty spaces shall exist in a row without the row being divided,
begun and or terminated with a landscape island; off-street parking areas with
multiple access aisles shall be designed and constructed with landscape islands
dividing at least every twelve parking spaces in a row. Such islands shall have a
minimum width of eight feet and shall have a minimum depth equal to the depth of
the adjacent parking stall(s). In addition to being designed with landscape islands
dividing the rows, large parking areas with multiple rows of parking aisles shall be
divided into sub-lots (sub-areas) containing no more than thirty-six spaces along
either side of an aisle. Such sub-lots shall be divided by cross-access aisles
allowing for cross circulation between aisles. The minimum width of such crossaccess
aisles shall be twenty-two feet.
(c) All landscape islands shall be designed and constructed to include continuous
curbing around their perimeter and shall be back filled with topsoil to a depth
of thirty inches (30), as shown in the diagram below, and shall be free of rock,
debris, inorganic compositions and chemical residues detrimental to plant life.
All such landscape islands shall be planted with shade trees or, in appropriate
circumstances, ornamental trees as specified in subsection (J) of this article.
(d) The stormwater drainage plan and landscaping plan shall be coordinated so
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:223
APPENDIX A - ZONING
the landscaping plan enhances stormwater drainage.
(2) Landscape requirements for existing parking lots:
(a) In parking lots required to be landscaped according to subsection 27(C)(3),
trees shall be planted at the rate of one shade tree or two ornamental trees for
every twelve and five tenths spaces.
(b) Required trees shall be located within or adjacent to parking lots as tree islands,
medians, at the end of parking bays, traffic delineators, or between rows or
parking spaces in a manner such that no parking space is located more than
one hundred feet from a parking lot tree.
(c) The landscape requirements for parking lots are in addition to the requirements
for buffer zones and perimeter landscaping. Trees located within the buffer
zones or required perimeter landscaping cannot be credited toward the parking
lot requirements.
(3) Landscaping requirements for base of buildings.
(a) A three (3) foot minimum width landscape strip planted with shrubs, trees and
other landscape materials in accordance with this Section 27 shall be provided
along the front and sides adjacent to the base of the buildings or separated from
buildings by a sidewalk. The landscape area may be used for menu boards to
the extent otherwise permitted by this article and other regulations of the City.
(b) The base of building landscaping requirement in subsection (a) above shall not
be required:
[1] on the side of a building that provides drive-thru pick-up windows or bank
teller drive-thru windows, or
[2] within five (5) feet of a pedestrian building entrance, a vehicular access
door, loading dock, or in such a manner as to block access to a door or
other building element requiring access, or
[3] within maneuvering areas that are not visible from a public right-of-way, or
[4] for land zoned H-I (Heavy Industrial), G-I (General Industrial District) or
L-I (Light Industrial) when such land is developed with a use identified as
Industrial in Chart 1 of Appendix A - Zoning.
(L) Buffer Zone and Screening Requirements.
(1) Buffer Zones Requirements.
(a) Buffer zones are intended to separate different land uses and zoning districts
from each other and are intended to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances
such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or parking
areas. Buffer zone types are determined by five different levels based on zoning
districts. The zoning districts have been divided into the following levels:
Residential Districts
RS-15, Single-Family Residential District
RS-12, Single-Family Residential District
RS-10, Single-Family Residential District
RS-8, Single-Family Residential District
RS-6, Single-Family Residential District
RS-4, Single-Family Residential District

P, Park District
(b) Table 1 shows how the different levels of zoning classifications relate to one
another to determine the type of buffer zone that is required. Each buffer zone
shall be designed and planted in the manner specified in Table 2. Additionally,
the Planning Commission and Planning Director retain their authority under
Section 7 to require that the owner meet other conditions of approval in order
to mitigate any other adverse impact that might affect adjacent landowners.
(c) A wall or solid fence, a minimum of six feet in height (constructed of masonry,
rock, pressure treated lumber or vinyl) may be used to reduce the amount of
buffer zone landscaping by fifty percent (50%).
(d) All trees in a planting yard shall be planted no closer than two and one half
(2½) feet from any public right-of-way.
(e) To determine the buffer zone required adjacent to property zoned as a Planned
Development the following shall be required:
[1] if the existing property is zoned PRD, the proposed land development shall
be required to provide a buffer as if the existing property is zoned RS-15;
[2] if the existing property is zoned PCD, the proposed land development shall
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:225
APPENDIX A - ZONING
be required to provide a buffer as if the existing property is zoned CF;
[3] if the existing property is zoned PND, the proposed land development shall
be required to provide a buffer as if the existing property is zoned OG;
[4] if the existing property is zoned PID, the proposed land development shall
be required to provide a buffer as if the existing property is zoned L-I;
[5] if the existing property is zoned PUD, the proposed land development shall
be required to provide a buffer as if the residential portions of the PUD
zoned land are zoned RS-15, the commercial portions are zoned CF, the
institutional portions are zoned OG, and the industrial portions are zoned
L-I.
(2) Screening Requirements.
(a) All utility boxes, service areas, mechanical equipment, trash containers,
dumpsters, and similar unaesthetic site elements shall be screened with the
use of plant material, fences or walls, berming and grading to eliminate negative
impacts.
(b) All exterior service, loading, storage, and utility areas (including transformers,
cooling towers, etc.) will be located at the side or rear of the building and shall
be screened or sheltered to reduce visibility from the public right-of-way.
(3) Screening and Landscaping Requirements for Stormwater Management Areas.
(a) Stormwater management areas, including detention and retention areas and
other similar areas, shall be landscaped to visually enhance such areas and to
provide a more natural appearance. The entire perimeter of such stormwater
management areas shall be landscaped as follows: a minimum of one shade
tree for every 40 linear feet and one shrub for every 15 linear feet. The required
plantings are encouraged to be grouped together to achieve a less regimented,
more natural appearance. Alternative landscape plans that achieve the goals
outlined above and that provide an equivalent or greater amount of landscaping
may be submitted for the review and approval of the Planning Director or
designee.
(b) The Planning Director or the Planning Commission shall have the authority to
require additional landscaping if it is determined that additional plantings are
needed for the purpose of screening the stormwater management area.
(c) Stormwater management areas will be reviewed by the Planning Department
on a case-by-case basis to determine if safety measures are needed. If safety
measures are required, plantings may be allowed as an element of the safety
plan, as determined by the Planning Department.
(M) Irrigation Requirements. All required landscaping shall be watered by one of the
following methods, subject to the provisions of Section 33-101 et seq. dealing with
the Mayors declaration of a water shortage emergency:
(1) For a site of any size an underground or above ground irrigation system; or
(2) For a commercial site of less than one and one-half acres (1½) a hose attachment,
available for use for irrigation only, located within three hundred feet of all
landscaping.
(N) Landscape Installation. All landscaping materials shall be installed in accordance with
accepted and professional planting procedures. Any landscape material which fails to
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:226
APPENDIX A - ZONING
meet the minimum requirements or standards of this section at the time of installation
shall be removed and replaced with acceptable materials.
(O) Maintenance Requirements.
(1) After the installation bond described in subsection (T) is satisfied or forfeited, the
owner shall submit a maintenance bond to the City in an amount equal to twentyfive
percent (25%) of the required landscape and irrigation cost. The maintenance
bond shall be held by the City to assure the maintenance of all required landscaping
for a period of three years. During the three year maintenance bond period the
owner: shall keep required landscaping in a proper, neat and orderly appearance,
free from weeds and debris; shall replace any required plantings that die with
plantings that have similar characteristics and form; and, shall not top trees or cut
tree limbs to stubs larger than three inches of diameter within the tree crown so
as to remove the normal canopy. Maintenance during the three year maintenance
bond period shall be subject to oversight and enforcement by the Planning Director.
If all required landscaping is in reasonable order and condition according to the
originally approved plan at the end of the three year period, the maintenance bond
shall be returned to the owner; if it is not, it shall be forfeited to the City.
(2) An owner shall be responsible for the perpetual maintenance of all landscaping
materials required by City Code Appendix A  Zoning and / or as depicted on an
approved Site Plan and shall keep them in a proper, neat and orderly appearance,
free from weeds, refuse and debris at all times. Should a plant or portion of the
required landscaping die, the owner shall be responsible for replacing said plantings
with a plant or plants that have similar characteristics and form. For example, an
evergreen tree shall be replaced with another evergreen tree, a shade or ornamental
tree shall be replaced with another shade or ornamental tree, and evergreen
shrubs or flowering shrubs shall be replaced with similar types. The replacement
plants shall be the same size as was originally approved on the landscape plan
or larger. The topping of any tree is expressly prohibited. Topping trees or the
severe cutting of limbs to a predetermined height to such a degree as to remove
the normal canopy is not proper maintenance of trees as required by this section.
Trees shall be pruned in accordance with ANSI (American National Standards
Institute) A-300. This maintenance requirement shall be subject to oversight
and enforcement by the Development Services Division. An owner shall not be
responsible for the perpetual maintenance of landscaping on land subsequently
acquired by a government. Should the owner of a property discover that there is
insufficient space to replace the landscaping due to the maturing of the originally
planted materials, then the owner shall contact the Development Services Division
and request that a site inspection be conducted. The Development Services
Division will evaluate each site on a case by case basis to determine what plants,
if any, shall be replanted according to the originally approved landscape plan.
(P) Landscape Restrictions - Sight Triangle Standards.
(1) A sight triangle is that area located at the intersection of two public streets or
a public street and private driveway through which an unobstructed view of
approaching traffic is necessary for motorists. Except as permitted in this section,
no landscaping or vegetation, or fence, structure, or object shall be included in a
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:227
APPENDIX A - ZONING
sight triangle in a subsection (E) landscape plan, nor shall any such landscaping
or object be planted, erected or maintained within a sight triangle. A sight triangle
shall be defined by the table and illustration below:
Sight Triangle
The distance D shall measure twenty feet and fifteen feet from the edge of
the nearest travel lane for a public street and private driveway, respectively.
The distance L shall be measured from the centerline of the minor approach
to a point at the edge of the nearest travel lane. The distance R shall be
measured from the centerline of the minor street to a point on the centerline
of the major street approach.
Minimum Required Sight Distances for Different Posted Speed Limits
Posted Speed Limit
Minimum Sight
Distance (L and R)
25 mph 200 ft
30 mph 250 ft
35 mph 325 ft
40 mph 400 ft
45 mph 475 ft
50 mph 550 ft
55 mph 650 ft
Posted speed limit on the major approach.
Except at a signalized intersection, the speed
limit of the approach from which the sight
distance is being measured is ignored.
Sight triangles shall be measured from the minor leg of the intersection
of two public streets where the minor approach shall be defined as that
approach whose right-of-way is controlled by a stop sign and whose
major approach is uncontrolled. At a signalized intersection of two
public streets, sight triangles shall be measured for all approaches. For
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:228
APPENDIX A - ZONING
an intersection of a public street and private driveway, the sight distance
is only measured from the private driveway.
(2) No landscaping object or plant material, except those meeting the requirements
set forth below, shall be allowed within the sight triangle at an elevation greater
than thirty inches above the crown of pavement on the adjacent roadway.
(a) Trees used in the sight triangle may exceed thirty inches in height provided
they have an acceptable minimum branching clearance of seven feet from
the ground to the first branch. Trees with a naturally high branching pattern
are preferred, but trees with low branching patterns may be used if pruned
to eliminate lower branches. Trees with normally low branching patterns that
would be adversely affected by heavy pruning shall be unacceptable. Trees
with descending branches such as weeping willow and weeping cherry shall be
unacceptable.
(b) Trees that normally develop a mature trunk with a diameter exceeding twelve
inches shall not be acceptable. A maximum trunk diameter of eight inches shall
be preferable. The estimated mature trunk size of the tree shall be considered,
not the trunk size at the time of installation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
existing trees in the sight triangle with a trunk diameter greater than twelve
inches may remain unless the City Engineer, or designee, determines there is
a threat to public safety.
(c) When multiple trees are planted within the sight triangle, they shall be planted
in staggered positions to avoid a picket fence effect where visibility is reduced
by a solid row of tree trunks. Multiple trees located in the sight triangle shall be
placed no closer than twenty feet on-center from one another.
(3) Notwithstanding the table and illustration provided in this section, the City Engineer
or designee may recommend variances of this section to the Board of Zoning
Appeals, which shall have the authority to grant variances upon application by the
owner. Any variance for landscaping shall take into account roadway conditions
as they relate to traffic control devices, alignments, geometrics, or other unique
circumstances that are supported by generally accepted engineering practices or
principles, or actual on-site studies.
(4) No landscape plan shall be approved if the landscaping proposed for the intersection
of a public street and a vehicular use area would create an unsafe obstruction in
the opinion of the City Engineer or designee. No landscaping or vegetation, or
fence, structure, or object, shall be planted, erected, or maintained by an owner
at the intersection of a public street and a vehicular use area if it creates a safety
hazard by obstructing the view of a motorist.
(Q) Credit towards Landscaping for Preserved Trees.
(1) Credits for preserved trees are offered when a tree preservation plan is submitted
and approved along with the site plan prior to commencing any grading or
construction activity on a site. A tree preservation plan may be submitted as part
of the landscape plan. A tree preservation plan must show that there will be no
substantial disturbance in the critical root zone (CRZ). A substantial disturbance
is considered compaction of soil, trenching, placing backfill in the CRZ, grading or
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:229
APPENDIX A - ZONING
dumping of trash, oil, paint, or other materials detrimental to plant health in close
proximity of the tree(s).
(2) The Development Services Division will review each tree preservation plan on a
case by case basis and shall visit the site to confirm the accuracy of the survey
and tree protection plan. Only those trees that are determined to be viable and
savable will receive tree credits. A tree(s) that is found to be hazardous, diseased
or severely injured will not receive tree credits. Likewise, if it is found that a large
portion of the root system of a tree(s) will be disturbed or destroyed by grading,
trenching, etc., then no tree credits will be granted. Only those trees that exhibit
a reasonable chance of survival will receive tree credits. Should the owner of
the property wish to receive credit for a tree that did not initially qualify for credit,
then said owner may provide documentation from a certified arborist regarding the
particular trees health and survivability. This documentation shall include any and
all corrective measures, including long-term maintenance that would be effective
toward saving the tree(s). The City will review any such additional documentation.
(3) Protective barricades shall be placed around all trees designated in the tree
preservation plan prior to the start of development activities, and shall remain in
place until development activities are complete. The area within the protective
barricade shall remain free of all building materials, dirt or other construction debris,
vehicles and development activities. Failure to comply with this requirement will
result in the denial of tree credits and the landscape plan will have to be modified
to include new tree plantings.
(4) Decisions regarding tree credits may be the subject of an administrative appeal to
the BZA.
(5) The following information shall be submitted and/or indicated on the tree
preservation plan:
(a) tree survey at the same scale as the site plan or landscape plan, showing
location of each existing tree(s) to be preserved that is 1½ inches in diameter
or larger;
(b) groups of trees in close proximity (those within five feet of each other) may
be designated as a clump of trees, with the predominant species, estimated
number and average diameter indicated;
(c) species, size and condition of each tree(s);
(d) trees which are noteworthy due to size, age, historic, cultural or aesthetic value;
(e) trees to be removed;
(f) location and type of tree protection barrier;
(g) any proposed changes in grade or drainage around tree(s) to be preserved;
(h) location of all existing utilities and proposed utilities; and,
(i) location of all existing and proposed structures, improvements, rights-of-way,
and easements on the property (driveways, alleys, walkways, bicycle paths,
parking lots, etc.).
(6) Credits for existing trees will be given at the following rate:
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:230
APPENDIX A - ZONING
Diameter of Existing Tree (inches) Tree Credit
Greater than: Up to and including:
1½ 6 1
6 12 2
12 24 3
24 36 4
36 48 5
48 60 6
1 additional tree for each
additional twelve inches
diameter
Minimum size requirement to qualify for tree preservation is one and
one-half (1½) inch caliper.
(7) Upon approval of a tree preservation plan, an owner shall receive tree credits for a
tree within the surveyed portion of the property for which a site plan was submitted.
An owner may include an existing tree straddling an adjacent property line in a tree
preservation plan but tree credits for any such tree shall only be half of the amount
otherwise applicable. If an owner receives a one-half (½) tree credit for any tree
and that tree dies, the owner is required to replace that one-half (½) with one new
tree. For example, if an owner received two and one-half (2½) tree credits for one
forty-six inch diameter tree and it dies, the owner will be required to replant three
trees.
(8) Only if a preserved tree for which tree credits are given is located within a parking
area may those tree credits be used to satisfy the landscaping requirements
for parking lots under subsection (K). Tree credits may be used to satisfy the
landscaping requirements for perimeter landscaping under subsection (J) only for
the front, side or rear property line nearest the preserved trees; e.g. preserved
trees in a fence row on a rear property line may be used to satisfy the perimeter
landscaping requirement for the rear but not the front or side property lines.
(9) Should any tree designated on the tree preservation plan die or be removed at
anytime after approval of the plan or issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the
owner shall replace sufficient landscaping equal to the tree preservation credit
within six months and shall notify the Development Services Division in writing of
the tree(s) lost and the number, location, and species of the replacement tree(s).
The replacement tree(s) shall be a minimum of two and one-half (2½) inches in
caliper for a shade tree, a minimum of one and one-half (1½) inches of caliper for
an ornamental tree and a minimum of six feet in height for an evergreen tree.
(10) For trees to receive tree credit they must be adequately protected during
construction. Adherence to tree protection procedures described in the guidelines
promulgated by the Development Services Division shall be sufficient.
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:231
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(R) Tree Permits.
(1) No tree or portion thereof that lies within the Citys right-of-way may be removed
or maintained, and no new tree(s) may be planted, without prior approval from the
Public Works Division. The applicant must first obtain a non-fee tree work permit
to be reviewed by the Division. The City shall review and notify said applicant
within three working days as to whether the permit has been approved or denied.
(2) If the tree work permit is denied by the Public Works Division, the applicant may
elect to schedule a hearing before the Tree Board.
(3) Upon approval of the permit, the applicant is responsible for all costs associated
with the project including but not limited to tree removal cost, stump removal,
corrective pruning, etc.
(S) Inspections for Certificate of Occupancy. Site inspections for the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy will occur only after
the contractor or installer and the owner have submitted a landscape certificate of
compliance as described below to the Building and Codes Department. No certificate
of occupancy for any development on a site subject to the landscaping requirements
of this article shall be issued until all landscaping materials are in place in substantial
compliance with the approved landscape plan. However, should conditions reasonably
occur beyond the reasonable control of the owner that would delay the installation of
the landscaping, the owner may request a temporary certificate of occupancy from
the Building and Codes Department. No temporary certificate of occupancy will be
issued until a bond complying with subsection (T) has been received by the City. The
landscape certificate of compliance shall be as follows:

(T) Bond Requirements.
(1) A bond for one hundred ten percent (110%) of the cost of any uncompleted
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:233
APPENDIX A - ZONING
landscaping, including labor shall be submitted to the City by an owner seeking
a temporary certificate of occupancy. For the City to determine the total cost, the
owner or designee shall furnish a cost estimate prepared by a qualified landscape
contractor or nurseryman using prevailing material and labor costs. The landscape
bond may, with Citys approval, be combined with other site work requiring bonding,
i.e., paving, curb and gutter, seeding and strawing.
(2) The life of the bond shall not exceed twelve months, provided that the Development
Services Division, for good cause, may approve a reasonable extension of time
for installation of the landscaping upon the posting of a bond for the period of the
extension. If the approved landscaping is not properly installed within the time
allotted, the bond shall be forfeited to the City. Forfeiting the bond shall not relieve
the owner of the duty to comply with this section.
(3) Bonds may be in the form of a cashiers check, letter of credit, certificate of deposit
or a performance bond. No personal or corporate checks will be accepted.
(4) Failure to install said landscaping within twelve months without proper extension,
shall be considered a violation of this article.
(U) Administration and Enforcement. The rules and regulations of this section will be
administered and enforced by the Development Services Division. Interpretations of
this section will be made under Section 11 of this article. Appeals from administrative
decisions made under this section will be made in accordance with Section 12 of this
article.
(V) Variances.
(1) Variances from the provisions of this section will be made in accordance with
Section 10 of this article provided, however, that the provisions of subsections (2)
and (3) shall be substituted for the provisions of subsection (E) of Section 10.
(2) A variance from the landscape requirements in subsections (I), (J), (K), (L), (M),
and (P) may be requested if a lot contains a building, structure, development,
or parking area that was in existence as of the effective date of this section. A
variance from these requirements may be requested for an unimproved lot only if
the lot was in existence as of the effective date of this section or, if the lot was not in
existence as of the effective date of this section, if the conditions or configurations
of the lot changed after the effective date of this section and the change was not
created by the owner, the owners representative, or the owners predecessor in
title, e.g. condemnation of a portion of the lot.
(3) Each applicant for a variance shall have the burden of proving that compliance with
the landscape requirements would be extraordinarily difficult because of one or
more unusual characteristics of the property. Generally such characteristic may not
have been created by deliberate action of the owner or the owners representative.
Each applicant for a variance must prove that an alternative and equivalent means
of landscaping is not viable. In considering a variance request, cost alone is not
an extraordinary difficulty and it does not justify granting a variance.
(W) Agreement to Landscape in City Easement. Whenever landscaping is proposed to be
located within a dedicated drainage or a dedicated water and/or sewer easement, the
owner shall obtain written permission from the City by using the following form:

Section 28. Nonconformities.
(A) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish regulations and limitations on
the continued existence of uses, lots, structures and signs established prior to the
effective date of this article which do not conform to the provisions of this article. Many
such nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this section are designed to
curtail substantial investment in such nonconformities and to bring about their eventual
elimination, where appropriate, in order to preserve the integrity of the zoning districts
and the regulations established by this article.
(B) Nonconforming use of land and structures.
(1) Authority to continue. Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of part or all of
a structure, or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land not involving a
structure or involving a structure which is accessory to such use of land, may
be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of
subsection (B)(2) through (7) of this section.
(2) Ordinary repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or
replacement, installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is devoted in
whole or in part to a nonconforming use; provided, however, that this subsection
shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of subsections (B)(3) through (7) of
this section.
(3) Extensions. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, or enlarged or
increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, without being limited
to:
(a) Extension of such use to any structure or land area other than that occupied by
such nonconforming use on the effective date of this article, or any amendment
hereto which causes such use to become nonconforming;
(b) Extension of such use within a building or other structure to any portion or the
floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective
date of this article, or any amendment hereto which causes such use to become
nonconforming;
(c) Operation of such nonconforming use in such a manner as to conflict with, if
already conflicting on the effective date of this article, or in the amendments
hereto, any use limitations established for the district in which such use is
located.
(4) Relocation. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use shall be relocated in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any

Section 32. Regulation of Sexually Oriented Adult Businesses.
(A) Purpose. In the development and execution of this section, it is recognized that there
are some uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious
objectionable operational characteristics and effects, particularly when several of them
are concentrated in close proximity, thereby increasing the deleterious secondary
impacts upon public safety, public health, property values, community economic
conditions, and the reasonable use and enjoyment of adjacent public and private
property. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to prevent crime, to reduce
transmission of disease, and to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute
to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. These special
regulations are itemized in this section. The primary purpose of control or regulation
of these uses is to prevent a concentration of these uses in any one area. It is not
the intention of the City Council to unlawfully suppress any speech activities that are
protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Neither is it
the intent of the Council to condone or legitimize obscene or unlawful materials or
activities. Zoning is an appropriate means to regulate land uses, including sexually
oriented adult businesses, as to the time, place and manner of development and
operation so as to mitigate the impacts of a given land use upon the public. Uses
subject to these controls are as follows:
Adults-only bookstores
Adult cabaret
Adult entertainment centers
Adults-only motion picture theaters

Section 33. Regulations for Zero-Lot Line Developments.
(A) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish regulations governing zero-lot
line developments to ensure that zero-lot line subdivisions develop in locations and
in accordance with specified design criteria to assure harmonious development both
within the zero-lot line subdivision and with other adjoining properties. It is intended
that areas zoned to allow zero-lot line developments have a minimum acreage and
adequate street frontage sufficient to allow for safe and proper design and arrangement
of lots, structures, utilities, and driveways. It is further intended that areas zoned to
allow zero-lot line developments should not be of such large size that there is an
undue impact on utilities, traffic, public services, and other public infrastructure.
(B) Applicability. All new single-family dwellings attached or detached with zero side yards
shall comply with the requirements of this section in addition to the requirements for
site plan approval and subdivision development. This section shall have no application
to planned developments as authorized and approved under Section 13 of this article.

the restrictions and covenants prior to sale of any of the lots in the development.
The covenants and restrictions shall provide for a form of dispute resolution so that
maintenance of the structures within the development including but not limited to
exterior painting, roof repair, lawn care, fence repair, etc. can be coordinated and
accomplished in a timely and effective manner. The covenants and restrictions
shall further provide that:
(a) if a fire wall is destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty, any owner may
restore it and if the other owners thereafter makes use of the wall, the other
owner(s) shall contribute to the cost of restoration thereof in proportion to such
use without prejudice to the right any such owner to call for a larger contribution
from the other(s) under any rule of law requiring liability for negligent or
contractual obligation;

necessitates construction work or access on the dwelling unit of the other
portion, either portion owner shall have an easement on the property of the
other for the purpose of this construction and maintenance and each party shall
contribute to the cost of restoration thereof in proportion to such use without
prejudice, however, to the right of any such owner to call for a larger contribution
from the others under any rule or law requiring liability for negligent or willful
acts or omissions; and,
(d) where utility lines extend across a lot or through a structure to provide services
to another lot or unit, an easement shall be provided across the lot or through
the structure for the benefit of the adjoining property owner for the purpose of
reconstruction, maintenance, or protection of the utility line. Such easement
shall be noted on the subdivision or resubdivision plat submitted for the purpose
of creating the property lines between the attached units.
(E) Requirements specific to zero-lot line detached structures and developments.
(1) Single family zero-lot line detached structures shall be provided an easement a
minimum of three feet wide on the lot adjoining the zero side yard line for the
purpose of construction and maintenance of the structure. The area within this
easement shall be restricted to remain free and clear of obstructions that will limit
the ability to use the easement for its intended purpose. The area within this
easement may be graded to assure proper lot drainage to prevent damage from
storm drainage to the structure.
(2) No portion of a structure may project over a property line including but not limited to
chimneys, flues, fire boxes, belt courses, leaders, sills, pilasters, lintels, cornices,
eaves, gutters, fire escapes, outside stairways, awnings, canopies, decks, railings,

OBJECTIVES
(A) Statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Tennessee has, in Tennessee
Code Annotated Sections 13-7-201 through 13-7-210 delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units, to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
(B) Findings of fact.
(1) The Mayor and City Council wishes to maintain eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) and in order to do so must meet the NFIP regulations
found at Ch. 1, Section 60.3, of the Code of Federal Regulations Title 44, Ch. 1,
Section 60.3.
(2) Areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and
general welfare.
(3) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains,
causing increases in flood heights and velocities, by uses in flood hazard areas
which are vulnerable to floods, or construction which is inadequately elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(C) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas. This ordinance is designed to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or erosion hazards, or which
result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers which are involved in the accommodation floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood
damage or erosion; and,
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(D) Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are:
(1) To protect human life, health, safety and property;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and as mains,

electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodprone
areas;
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development
of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize blight in flood areas;
(7) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodable
area; and
(8) To maintain eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

no permanently attached structures or additions; or,
[3] The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including the anchoring and elevation requirements of this section above if
on the site for longer than 180 consecutive days.
(5) Standards for subdivisions and proposed new developments. Subdivisions and
other proposed new developments, including manufactured home parks, shall
be reviewed to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from
flooding in accordance with the Citys ordinances and Subdivision Regulations
by the City Engineer and the Administrator. If a subdivision proposal or other
proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall be
reviewed to ensure that:
(a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage.
(b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer,

UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:268
APPENDIX A - ZONING
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion
potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow
for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities.
Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material new construction,
substantial improvements or other developments within the regulatory floodway.
Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments
or new development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, shall not result in any increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood level, velocities or floodway widths during the occurrence of a base flood
discharge at any point within the community. A registered professional engineer
must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
(2) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V.
(D) Standards for areas of special flood hazard Zones AE with established base flood
elevations but without floodways designated. Located within the areas of special flood
hazard established in Article III subsection (B), where streams exist with base flood
data provided but where no floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following
provisions apply:
(1) No encroachments, including fill material, new structures and substantial
improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless
certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The
engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to
standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(2) New construction and substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or
flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with Article V subsection
(B).
(E) Standards for streams without established base flood elevations or floodways (A
Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard areas established in Article
III, subsection (B), where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided
and where a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) The Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from any Federal, State or other sources,
including data developed as a result of these regulations (see 2 below), as criteria
for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development
in approximate A Zones meet the requirements of Article V subsections (A) and
(B).
(2) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than
50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood

APPENDIX A - ZONING
elevation data.
(3) Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations have not been established
and where such data is not available from other sources, require the lowest floor
of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of at least one foot (1)
above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in Article II). All applicable data
including elevations or floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in
Article IV subsection (B). Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the
standards of Article V subsection
(4) Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations have not been established
and where such data is not available from other sources, no encroachments,
including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the
width of the stream or twenty feet (20), whichever is greater, measured from the
top of the stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
(1) foot at any point with the City of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The engineering
certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
(5) New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted,
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article
V subsections (A) and (B). Within approximate A Zones, require that those
subsections of Article V subsection (B) dealing with the alteration or relocation
of a watercourse, assuring watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and
manufactured homes provisions are complied with as required.
(F) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones). Located within the areas
of special flood hazard established in Article III subsection (B), are areas designated
as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with
base flood depths of one to three feet (1-3) where a clearly defined channel does not
exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the
following provisions apply in addition to those in Article V subsections (A) and (B):
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential
buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at
least one foot (1) above the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance

meeting the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide such certification to the
Administrator as set forth above and as required in Article IV subsection (B).
(3) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide floodwaters
around and away from proposed structures.
(4) The Administrator shall certify the elevation or the highest adjacent grade, where
applicable, and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(G) Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99 Zones). Located within
the areas of special flood hazard established in Article III are areas of the 100-year
floodplain protected by a flood protection system but where base flood elevations
have not been determined. Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of Article IV
and Article V subsection (A) shall apply.
(H) Standards for unmapped streams. Located within the City are unmapped streams
where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to
such streams the following provisions shall apply:
(1) In areas adjacent to such unmapped streams, no encroachments including fill
material or structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice
the width of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless
certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the locality.
(2) When new elevation data is available, new construction or substantial improvements
of buildings shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in
accordance with Article IV.
ARTICLE VI. VARIANCE PROCEDURES
The provisions of this subsection shall apply exclusively to areas of special flood hazard.
(A) Board of Zoning Appeals.
(1) The BZA shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this ordinance.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon
a determination that the proposed, repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this ordinance to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
(3) In passing upon such applications, the BZA shall consider all technical evaluations,
all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and:
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:271
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other property to the injury of
others;
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
(e) The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally
dependent facility;
(f) The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion
damage for the proposed use;
(g) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area;
(h) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
(i) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of
the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the
site, and;
(j) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(4) Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this ordinance,
the BZA may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to effectuate the purposes of this ordinance.
(5) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(B) Conditions for variances.
(1) Variances shall be issued upon a determination that, the variance is the minimum
relief necessary, considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical
building, a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary so as
not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(2) Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and sufficient cause, a
determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship;
or a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
(3) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result
in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and that such construction below
the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
(4) The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
ARTICLE VII. LEGAL STATUS PROVISIONS
UPDATED: May 21, 2020 APP A:272
APPENDIX A - ZONING
(A) Conflict with other ordinances. In case of conflict between this ordinance or any part
thereof, and the whole or part of any existing or future ordinance of the City, the most
restrictive shall in all cases apply.
(B) Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance shall be held
to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding
shall not affect any other section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance which
is not of itself invalid or unconstitutional.

occupation approval is requested in order for the applicant to establish an address
necessary for obtaining a business license and can meet the following standards, the
special use permit for the home occupation may be issued by the Planning Director.
In the event the Director has doubt regarding the compatibility of the proposed home
occupation with adjoining land uses, the Director shall deny approval. The applicant
may apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals as pro-vided in Sections 8 and 9 of Appendix

(b) No business signs shall be permitted.
(c) There shall be no alteration of the residential building which changes the character
thereof as a dwelling. No display of products shall be visible from the street.

the dwelling unit. No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the area of a residential
dwelling unit and accessory structure, if used as part of the home occupation, shall
be devoted to the home occupation. In the event the home occupation is to be
conducted totally from within an accessory structure, no more than five hundred

home occupa-tion shall be permitted per residential dwelling unit.
(e) No mechanical or electrical equipment may be used in a residential dwelling unit or
accessory structure in connection with a home occupa-tion except such types as
are customary for domestic, household, or hob-by purposes; personal computers
and facsimile machines may be used. Machinery that causes noise likely to be
heard by neighbors or interfer-ence with radio or television reception shall be
prohibited.
(f) There shall be no storage outside a dwelling unit or accessory structure of
equipment or materials used in connection with the home occupation.
(g) Any request for a home occupation which would potentially generate traf-fic or a

administrative decision as provided in Sec-tion 12 of Appendix A - Zoning. Should
it be learned later that the admin-istrative approval was in error for any reason or

storage of wrecked or partially dismantled vehicles. Provid-ed, however, the screening
requirement shall not be for the entire site unless otherwise required by Appendix A

a public right-of-way will not be necessary and adequate space will be available
for vehicles to turn around on-site. An on-site off-street area shall be provided for
vehicles to load and unload passengers. Park-ing areas shall not be permitted in
the required front yard.
(b) In all residential districts, institutional group assembly uses shall have a lot size not
less than three times the minimum lot size permitted in the zoning district where

institutional group assembly use is proposed to be located on land that has two or
more different zoning classifications, the minimum lot size shall be calculated by
applying the larger required minimum lot size.

To determine maximum allowable total floor area on a lot:
Multiply F.A.R. x lot area = maximum total floor area
Example: .50 x 60,000 sq. ft. = 30,000 sq. ft. floor area

To determine maximum building coverage on a lot:
Multiply O.S.R. x lot area and subtract from lot area
Example: . 70 x 60,000 sq. ft. = 42,000 sq. ft.
60,000 sq. ft. - 42,000 sq. ft. = 18,000 sq. ft.
