PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the Town of Surfside Beach of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, as supplemented through July 1, 1986, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The 2005 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 05-0557, adopted March 22, 2005, and was accomplished under the supervision of Diana Ossi, Editor. 
    The Code is divided into two volumes. Volume I contains the administrative regulations of the town. Volume II contains the land use and development regulations. The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of each volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the third section of Chapter 4 is 4-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 5-1 and 5-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-1.1, 5-1.2 and 5-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 6 and 7, it will be designated as Chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code appearing at the end of Volume II has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volumes. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Linda Davis, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Pat Di Giovanni, former Town Administrator, Buck Cutts, former Town Attorney and Patsy Rutland, former Town Clerk and the other members of the town staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

    Open-ended contract means any written contracts, purchase orders or agreements or modifications thereto allowing for future changes or additions to the amount contained in the contracts, purchase orders or agreements or modifications thereto. 
(Ord. No. 14-0784, 1-27-15) 
Sec. 2-186. - Deposits and withdrawals. 
    All monies of the town shall be deposited in a bank or depository selected by the town council. All manual checks shall require a signature from any two (2) of the following persons: the town administrator, the finance director, the mayor, or the mayor pro tempore. 
(Ord. No. 14-0784, 1-27-15; Ord. No. 14-0790, 10-28-14) 
Sec. 2-187. - Funds established and purposes. 
(a)  General fund. This fund is to account for the operations of the town government that are not reported in another fund. The fund balance for the general fund may have various classifications of fund balance that comprise a hierarchy based primarily on the extent to which the town is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for which amounts can be spent as follows: 
(1)  Non-spendable fund balance. The portion of fund balance that is non-spendable and includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either: 
a.  Not in spendable form which includes items that are not expected to be converted to cash, such as inventories and prepaid amounts, and items such as the long-term amount of loans and notes receivable, as well as property acquired for resale; 
b.  Legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. The corpus (or principal) of a permanent fund is an example of an amount that is legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. 
(2)  Restricted fund balance. The portion of fund balance that is restricted for specific purposes which are externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, laws, regulations, or imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. The town's restricted funds are for the victims advocate program and the drug enforcement program. 
(3)  Committed fund balance. The portion of fund balance that has been "committed" for a specific purpose determined by an approved ordinance by town council, the town's highest level of decision making authority, before the end of the fiscal year. Commitments may be changed or lifted only by town council taking the same formal action by ordinance that originally imposed the constraint. 
The town council establishes the following committed fund balance amounts for the general fund: 
Disaster recovery reserve. This committed fund balance is due to the town's coastal location and the associated risk for hurricanes and other natural disasters. The initial funding shall be four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000.00) transferred from the unassigned balance in the general fund. The goal is to achieve a balance of one million two hundred thousand dollars ($1,200,000.00) by 2020. Use of these funds must be approved by a super-majority of town council. The balance of this reserve will be reviewed during the annual budget process. 
(4)  Assigned fund balance. The portions of fund balance that have been assigned for specific purposes that are not restricted or committed and that have been established by either an approved motion of town council before the report date. 
Currently the town has the following assigned fund balances within the general fund: 
(i)  Assigned to capital replacements reserve, which shall be for the replacement of vehicles, computer equipment and other assets with a life exceeding five (5) years. This fund is assigned three (3) mils each year and expenditures are approved in the budget process. The expected balance of this fund is reviewed by town council during the budget review. 
(ii)  Land, meters, and parking purposes reserve, which shall receive net revenue from parking operations, however, not to include pier parking revenue, and shall be used to beautify parking areas, purchase and maintain parking equipment, pay for parking operations, and/or purchase additional land. 
(iii)  Reserved. 
(5)  Unassigned fund balance. Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund. This classification represents fund balance that has not been assigned to other funds and that has not been restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes within the general fund. Unassigned fund balance may also include negative balances for any governmental fund, if expenditures exceed amounts restricted, committed, or assigned for those specific purposes. The town council desires to have sufficient working capital and a margin of safety to address cyclical fluctuations of revenues and expenses. The town shall maintain an unassigned fund balance at the end of each fiscal year, which is approximately four (4) months of general fund expenditures. 
(b)  Capital projects fund. 
(1)  The finance director shall set up and maintain a separate fund to be known as the capital projects fund. 
(2)  The capital projects fund will receive all capital related debt proceeds, tax millage and/or other revenue for special projects as designated in the approved budget. 
(3)  Payments for budgeted expenditures from the capital projects fund shall be authorized by two (2) signatories as prescribed in the Town Code. 
(4)  Reporting for the capital projects fund shall be included as a part of the regular monthly accounting report when a project is on-going. 
(5)  The capital projects fund shall receive all designated revenue. 
(6)  Restricted for street improvements. Annual vehicle registration fees received from Horry County are to be used for road improvements. 
(7)  Assigned to beach renourishment fund. The accommodations tax fund and the hospitality fund shall both transfer seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) annually to the beach renourishment fund. Beginning in fiscal year 2019-20, the pier fund shall transfer fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) annually to the beach renourishment fund. Said transfers shall not be expropriated for other uses and shall be solely reserved for the purpose of beach renourishment. Reserves for beach renourishment shall be held in the capital projects fund. 
(8)  The town council will determine the capital projects to be funded each year during the annual budget review and approval. 
(c)  Special revenue funds. Special revenue funds are funds created to account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditures for specified purposes. In the Town of Surfside Beach there are three (3) special revenue sources: state accommodations taxes; local accommodations taxes (Town Code section 4-119), and hospitality taxes (Town Code section 4-91). 
(d)  Enterprise funds. Enterprise funds are required to have various components of net position that include: (1) net investment in capital assets, (2) restricted net position, and (3) unrestricted net position. At no time may any enterprise fund's unrestricted net position go below four (4) months of anticipated expenses and transfers out. 
(1)  Sanitation fund. The sanitation fund was created April 1, 1997. Unrestricted net position will be maintained at four (4) months of operating expenses and transfers out. Should the balance fall below four (4) months, the town administrator will notify town council and determine a plan to bring the balance back into compliance. 
(2)  Pier fund. The pier enterprise fund was established by Resolution #08-073. The pier fund is established to reflect all funds received from public admissions, rental lease revenue paid by its tenants, parking revenue from the pier parking lot, and any other applicable revenue received. This fund shall be used for maintenance and operation of the pier. Once the pier fund has paid off its debt to the general fund, and is self-sufficient, thereafter the fund shall maintain a minimum of four (4) months of operating expenses and transfers out in the unrestricted net position category. Should the balance fall below four (4) months, the town administrator will notify town council and determine a plan to bring the balance back into compliance. 
(e)  Fund balances are estimated in the budgeting process. After the audit is published at the end of the fiscal year, all fund balance amounts will be reported to town council. Any shortfalls shall be required to be rebuilt to minimum levels during the next two (2) fiscal years budget preparation process. In the event any fund balance is above the required minimum, then the difference may be used to fund activities, subject to town council prior approval.

Sec. 3-52. - Birds and water fowl-Findings and determinations. 
    The town council (the "council") hereby finds and determines: 
(a)  The feeding of unconfined wildlife in any public park or on any other property owned or operated by the town is prohibited, so as to protect public health, safety and welfare. 
(b)  That the human hand-feeding of water fowl within the town limits is resulting in a public nuisance by the deposit of fecal matter, garbage, debris, and filth on surrounding properties, and destruction of lawns and ornamental shrubs, in addition to causing other problems for property owners whose properties are located next to or near people who choose to feed water fowl on a regular basis, as well as increasingly aggressive bird behavior. 
(c)  The feeding of ducks and geese encourages waterfowl to halt their normal migrations and establish a residency in the town. The growing populations of waterfowl result in large amounts of waterfowl droppings that potentially can spread disease. Other problems caused by droppings are excess nutrients in the town's lakes that in turn can cause algae blooms, damage to lawns and the soiling of public areas around the town's lakes. 
(d)  That according to the National Marine Fisheries Service it is unhealthy for the birds, and unhelpful to feed wild ducks, geese, or sea birds with foods other than foods essential to the proper development of young birds, and hunting for food increases wild birds survival, while hand feeding decreases hunting and survival skills. 
(e)  That the U.S. Department of Interior Fisheries and Wildlife Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) have determined that these fowl require young grass and vegetation for food and results in the destruction of lawns in residential areas, parks, community gardens, businesses and corporate areas resulting in development of overgrazing on grasses, ornamental plants, and accumulation of droppings; feathers; attacks on humans; fouling of reservoirs, beaches, docks, lawns, and destruction of crops and conflicts with humans. 
(f)  That the foremost method recommended by APHIS for discouragement of the settlement of large numbers of water fowl is the discontinuance of feeding in order to allow the fowl to revert back to the natural foods sources. 
(g)  It is the intention of this paragraph to allow residents to control resident Canadian Geese and other nuisance water fowl within the town limits in accordance with local, state and federal law. 
(h)  That it is the intent of this article to minimize the attraction of these birds by restricting their feeding and other acts that encourage the migratory waterfowl to halt their migrations and to reside in the town. It is not the intention of this chapter to halt the feeding of small non-migratory bird by citizens through the use of bird feeders on private property. 
(Ord. No. 09-0668, 5-26-09; Ord. No. 14-0775, 4-21-14) 
Sec. 3-53. - Prohibited activity. 
(a)  Subject to any exceptions contained in state and federal law, it shall be unlawful to take, trap, hunt, shoot, or attempt to shoot, in any manner whatsoever any bird or wild fowl, or to rob bird nests or wild fowl nests in the town. In the event that sparrows, blackbirds, pigeons, crows or similar birds or water fowl are found congregating in numbers in a particular locality within the town limits, as to constitute a public nuisance or menace to the public health or to private or public property, then in that event or any of them, the congregated birds or wild fowl may be discouraged, destroyed or removed by the town administrator, acting through the town police department or another agency or department of the town, county or state government in a manner consistent with state and federal laws concerning the protection of birds. 
(b)  Water fowl: It shall be unlawful to engage in the feeding of wild water fowl, ducks, geese, seagulls and/or pigeons within the city limits, which feeding results in the deposit of refuse, debris, fecal matter, or other offensive substance, in any place in the town, including but not limited to lakes and stormwater holding ponds to the prejudice or annoyance of any person, unless otherwise permitted by law; or which feeding results in aggressive bird behavior towards humans or other animals, or which results in endangering humans or other animals in any manner deemed advisable by and under the supervision and control of the police department of the town.

To perform any mechanical trades (electrical, gas, fire protection, plumbing, or heating and air conditioning work) an owner shall be qualified by having the appropriate South Carolina Mechanical Contractor's License or hold a valid master trade certification from an approved agency or municipality. 
(2)  Commercial property: 
a.  Permits shall not be issued to any property owner for any construction trades or work to be performed other than defined ordinary minor repairs on any property where the general public will have access, that is used for commercial purposes or residential property that is to be offered for sale, lease or rent unless properly licensed for such undertaking. 
(3)  Residential repairs and nonstructural alterations (owner-occupied primary home only): 
a.  A qualified property owner may obtain a special homeowners permit to perform general repairs, nonstructural alterations, electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning trades on their own residential property, in which they occupy as a primary residence (but not including property intended for rent, sale or gift), provided he first makes an application for and obtains a special homeowner's permit from the building and zoning department to do the specific work contemplated. 
1.  Qualified property owner. One who has passed a required town trade qualification exam in specific trades (building, electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning) for the purpose of being issued a special homeowner's permit. 
2.  Special homeowner's permit. A permit issued to a property owner for general repairs or alterations of nonstructural building components, electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning on their own primary dwelling in which they reside. 
b.  No such special permit shall be issued unless the applicant satisfies the town that they are competent by passing a qualification exam or showing credentials indicating they are capable of performing the work requested. 
c.  Once so satisfied, the town shall issue a permit to the applicant personally to perform the particular work for which the application was made. Such permit shall extend to the applicant only and shall not authorize the applicant to use the services of any other person to assist them unless such other person is a properly licensed contractor with their own permit. The permit granted the applicant shall automatically expire upon completion of the work which application was made and the permit issued. All work done under such permit shall be subject to town inspection requirements and fees along with satisfying all statutory and ordinance requirements applicable to such work. 
d.  These types of special permits are not for new construction, additions or structural alterations nor are these permits transferable or refundable. 
e.  All applications for special homeowner permits shall be accompanied by a homeowner affidavit sealed by a notary. 
(4)  Certificates of occupancy. Failure of the property owner to request and receive all required inspections and receive a final certificate of occupancy shall result in the denial of any type of future permit requests for that particular property until all outstanding inspections are performed, passed and the appropriate certificate issued. 
If no inspections have been requested or an extension of a permit granted within a six-month period the permit will be declared null and void as required by code and a new permit shall be obtained. Failure to obtain a new permit will constitute a building code violation subject [to] all penalties allowed by law.

(c)  Any contractor, subcontractor, or individual working for or receiving compensation directly from a property owner shall meet the state's bonding requirements. Failure to maintain bond required will be a violation of this article and will be sufficient grounds for license revocation or denial of additional permits and certificates of occupancy. 
(d)  Whenever a permit is required from the building department the owner or prime contractor shall require every contractor, subcontractor or individual not classified as an employee providing services on the project to be listed on a subcontractor list for each permit issued. Subcontractors or persons not listed on the subcontractors list found working on the job site will be in violation of this article. Certificates of occupancy will be withheld on all projects until the subcontractor list is verified.

(c)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the town council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark, the town council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and

(2)  If the town council takes no action within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic rates with the town, the proposed rates will continue in effect. 
(d)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the town council is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the town council shall, within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the town and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety (90) days if the town council need more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or

(f)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed initial basic rate may submit the objection in writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the town clerk with the objector's name and address. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the town council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the town council's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation.

(h)  Cost-of-service showing. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The town council will review a cost-of-service, submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The town council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates minus ten (10) percent, will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the town council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one (1) of the following: 
a.  If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the town council shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or 
b.  If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the town council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the town council determines that the initial basic cable rates that are submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the town council may order the rates reduced in accordance with paragraph (g) or (h) above, as applicable. In addition, the town council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the town council's decision resolution.

This notice may not be given more often than annually and not until at least one (1) year after the determination of the initial basic cable rates. 
(b)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the town council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the town council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rate increase within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the town. 
(2)  If the town council takes no action within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the town, the proposed rates will go into effect. 
(c)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the town council is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the town council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety (90) days if the town council needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and 
b.  One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap. 
(2)  The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period. 
(3)  If the town council has not made a decision within the ninety- or one hundred fifty-day period, the town council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.

If the town council is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the town council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the town council shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the town council's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the town council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the town council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for the cost-of-service review. The town council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  The town council's decision concerning the requested rate increase, shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted.

(2)  In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the town council may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting information to the Town Council may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall by physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection, shall not be considered. 
(c)  Town council action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b), will be acted upon by the town council. The town council will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a preponderance of the evidence, a case of nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from the public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the town council denies the request, the town council shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the town, the cable operator may request that the town return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the town will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires, will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the town council, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(d)  Appeal. If the town denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days of the town council's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review.

(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceed the GNP-PI. The factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in the franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation, or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the town at least thirty (30) days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The town shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the town makes no objection within thirty (30) days of receiving the notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect. 
(Ord. No. 93-0339, § 5, 11-2-93) 
Sec. 4-86. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Refunds. The town may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following circumstances:

(2)  The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued by the town. 
(b)  Fines. If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order, the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day the cable operator fails to comply.

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 08-0643, adopted November 11, 2008, enacted provisions intended for use as sections 7-101-7-117. Inasmuch as there are already provisions designated as 7-101-7-106, and at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been redesignated as sections 7-131-7-147. 

Sec. 7-131. - Findings and determinations. 
    The town council (the "council") of the Town of Surfside Beach, South Carolina, hereby finds and determines: 
(1)  The Town of Surfside Beach, South Carolina (the "town"), is an incorporated municipality located in Horry County, South Carolina, and as such possesses all powers granted to municipalities by the Constitution and the laws of the State of South Carolina, including the powers enumerated in S.C. Code § 5-7-30 (2005 Supp) relating to regulating streets, markets, and public health. 
(2)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute has determined that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to 65,000 Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10, "Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.) The Surgeon General has declared that: 
a.  Secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in nonsmokers exposed to smoke; 
b.  Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for sudden death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more severe asthma; 
c.  Adults exposed to secondary smoke have a higher risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer; 
d.  There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and 
e.  Separating smoking and nonsmoking sections of indoor areas does not sufficiently remove the threats of secondhand smoke in enclosed areas. 
(3)  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five to fifty (25-50) percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
(4)  Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(5)  Certain outdoor events, such as parades, festivals, and other public gatherings, result in nonsmokers finding themselves in close proximity to persons who are smoking which can be reasonably seen to have the same effects of exposure as when nonsmokers are exposed to smoke in the same enclosed space. Lighted cigarettes, cigars, and pipes of people standing or sitting in close proximity have the potential of burning those with whom they inadvertently come into direct contact and making the air quality and peaceful enjoyment of outdoor events unreasonably restricted for nonsmokers. 
(6)  When there is a presence of secondhand smoke in enclosed spaces or in outside areas where there is a public gathering resulting in people being in close proximity in places that are otherwise open to the public at large inevitably results in persons who do not smoke being forced to bear unwarranted health risks and inappropriate deprivation of peaceful enjoyment of the premises to which they have been invited or permitted to enter, even when steps have been taken to separate "smoking" and "nonsmoking" areas within the confined space. 
(7)  The town recognizes that smoke creates a danger to the health and safety of the public at large and that, in order to protect the health and welfare of the public, it is necessary to restrict smoking in the manner provided for in this article (the "article").

WARNING ON POSSESSION AND USE OF A LASER POINTER OR DEVICE 

PARENTS! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR MINORS! 

THIS PRODUCT CAN BE CONSIDERED A WEAPON!  Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient an operator of an airplane, helicopter or vehicle when the beam is directed toward them. The beam is much larger at long distances than you might think. Even though the laser projects a small, millimeter-sized dot close up, at longer distances the beam can be many inches across. When the beam hits the windscreen of a cockpit or the bubble of a helicopter, imperfections in and on the glass spread the light out even more, making it impossible for the pilot to safely navigate. Pilot exposure to the beam can result in flash blindness, glare and distraction in the immediate task of piloting the aircraft. Pointing a laser at an aircraft places all the persons aboard in mortal jeopardy.  It is a federal felony crime to aim a laser pointer at an aircraft, or at the flight path of an aircraft. The federal penalty is up to five (5) years in a federal prison and/or a fine of several thousand dollars. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "will pursue the toughest penalties" against persons who deliberately aim lasers at aircraft, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced on May 16, 2012. Since June 2011, FAA has taken action against 28 persons with an average fine of $11,000 per laser strike. The highest penalty sought so far is $30,800. FAA has directed its staff not to seek warning notices or counseling, but to use "moderately high civil penalties" for inadvertent laser illuminations, and maximum penalties for deliberate violations. The Town of Surfside Beach will inform the federal authorities of any arrests relating to this crime so that appropriate prosecution to the fullest extent of the law can be achieved at the federal level.  Section 55-3-130 of the South Carolina Code of Laws also makes it criminal offense to point, aim, or discharge a laser device at an occupied aircraft in the air or on the ground, providing a potential sentence for a first offense of one year in prison, a fine of $2,000, or both. A second or subsequent violation triggers the possibility of even greater sentencing.  A laser's light is concentrated into a narrow beam. If aimed at a person's eye from close up, most or all of the light goes through the pupil. The already concentrated light is further focused by the lens onto a sharp ("diffraction-limited") dot on the retina. Even at the lower power outputs, the power density from a one (1) milliwatt laser focused to a point is brighter than the equivalent area of the sun's surface. This can cause a detectable injury to the retina, if the laser stays in one spot for a few seconds. Laser beams can permanently blind a person or animal when the beam is directed into their eyes.  Any person of 17 years or older who possesses a laser pointer or device unlawfully, or who points a laser beam toward any vehicle, person or animal is subject to a conviction for violation of Town of Surfside Beach Code of Ordinance, for assault and battery, and/or for mistreatment of animals, with a $500 fine and up to 30 days imprisonment, or both, as well as being civilly liable for any personal injury to a person or animal, or damage to property, that might result from this illegal act.  PARENTS, GUARDIANS, AND RESPONSIBLE ADULTS: YOU WILL BE HELD PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISUSE OF THIS DEVICE BY ANY MINOR TO WHOM YOU PROVIDE THIS DEVICE, OR BY ANY OTHER PERSON TO WHOM THAT MINOR PROVIDES THIS DEVICE.  Any parent, guardian, person acting in loco parentis, or responsible adult person, who purchases a laser pointer or device for a minor, or who allows a minor in their custody to access, possess or use a laser pointer or device within the town limits of the Town of Surfside Beach and that laser pointer or device is possessed or used unlawfully, is subject to arrest and prosecution, and upon conviction, is further subject to a fine of $500 and up to 30 days imprisonment, or both. The parent is chargeable as a principal to the crime along with the minor in possession, or who illegally uses the device as a weapon, and is also subject to prosecution for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  Any minor 16 years or younger, who is in possession of, or who uses, a laser pointer or device unlawfully, is subject to service of a juvenile summons and will be prosecuted in Family Court by the Solicitors Office.  Lasers in the unlawful possession of minors are subject to immediate confiscation as contraband, in addition to any other law enforcement action.  Laser pointers or devices that are used illegally are contraband, and subject to immediate confiscation, in addition to any other law enforcement action. MERCHANT NAME ___________ Date                                 Merchant Represented by                   its                                (Employee Signature) (Position - clerk, owner, salesman, etc.) has verified that adult status has been confirmed, and that manufacturer's technical specifications are available to prove that the device is one (1) milliwatt or less, or if greater than one (1) milliwatt, set forth specific exception(s) applicable to possession and use. CUSTOMER hereby verifies he or she has read and received warnings regarding use of laser pointing devices and operation of laser pointing devices by minors (individuals that have not attained the age of 18 years.) CUSTOMER                                                        (PRINT Customer Name)     (CUSTOMER'S SIGNATURE)  
(Ord. No. 13-0736, 2-5-13) 
Sec. 8-200.5. - Laser pointers are considered weapons; assault and battery on person; mistreatment or abuse of animals. 
(a)  A laser pointer, or any other similar article, which consists of a hand-held, battery operated device of any output, designed or adapted to emit a laser beam and that may be used for the purposes of aiming, targeting or pointing, is considered a weapon when used unlawfully. 
(b)  When a laser pointer is directed to a person or upon a conveyance piloted, operated or occupied by a person, such conduct is deemed an assault and battery. 
(c)  When a laser pointer is directed to an animal (other than for lawful hunting purposes), such conduct is considered abuse or mistreatment of animals.

Where these individual chapters enumerate fees and additional requirements applicable to a review or permit, this article provides a cross-reference to those provisions. In the event that chapters 14, 15, or 17 provide fees or procedures, in addition to or in conflict with those enumerated below, the fees and procedures established by the respective chapters shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 11-0701, 3-8-11) 
Sec. 13-47. - General provisions for permits, reviews and approvals.

(d)  Separate permit required. A separate building and/or zoning permit shall be required for each building, structure, renovation, addition, or repair. Multiple events are not allowed to be issued on one (1) permit. 
(e)  Failure to obtain permit. The failure of any person, partnership, firm, or corporation to obtain a permit or approval prior to the commencement of any activity, for which a permit or approval is required, shall constitute a violation of chapters 13, 14, 15, and/or 17 and shall be punishable as provided therein. Except as may be otherwise provided by this article, failure to obtain a permit or approval prior to the commencement of any activity, for which a permit or approval is required, shall, in addition to other remedies, result in the assessment of late fees as provided below: 
(1)  A late fee shall be added to the cost of the required permit or review. The late fee shall be equal to no less than one hundred (100) percent of the cost of the required permit or review as specified herein. In cases where a permit is required by this code but no fee has been established, a minimum late fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be assessed. 
(2)  In addition to the late fee as provided in part (1) above, failure to obtain a building permit as required by division 2 of this article shall result in penalty of two hundred dollars ($200.00). 
(3)  After receipt of written notice from the code enforcement official and/or building official, an additional late fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be assessed for each calendar week, that a permit and/or approval is not obtained. 
(f)  Response to application. The administrative official responsible for the issuance of permits required under this chapter and or other approvals shall respond with issuance of a permit or denial to each residential application within fifteen (15) business days, and to each commercial application within twenty (20) business days. Records shall be maintained of all responses, permits and approvals. For applications for building or demolition permits not requiring additional review, this shall be a final response with issuance or denial of a permit within the stated times, except as provided hereinbelow in this chapter. For applications for permits under this chapter requiring review by the planning commission or town council, this response will be an initial response. Nothing herein is intended to limit the town's time for final response to complex applications under this chapter requiring review outside of the staff of the planning, building and zoning department, or in cases of emergency. 
(g)  Records. The record of all permit and approvals shall be, upon request, open to public inspection during regular office hours. At the discretion of the administrative official, a fee may be assessed for labor and copying costs for reproducing documents requested consistent with the town's fee schedule, published in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act and maintained at Town Hall.

Sec. 14-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code of Laws, Title 5, Chapters 7, 23 and 25 (Articles 5 and 7) and Title 6, Chapter 7, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and council of the Town of Surfside Beach, South Carolina does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-2. - Findings of fact. 
    The flood hazard areas of the Town of Surfside Beach are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increased flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-3. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. The provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the article prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of the article are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
    Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, and habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-4. - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Surfside Beach as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study, date September 17, 2003, as published by the Federal Emergency Management Act, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and other supporting data which are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study for the unincorporated areas of Horry County, with accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter. 
    Non-residential and residential structures must be constructed so that the lowest floor is located no lower than the base flood elevation plus three (3) feet. No environmentally conditioned space shall be allowed below the lowest floor. Floodproofing of commercial structures shall not be permitted within the town without a variance approval. Floodproofing residential structures shall be prohibited. 
    This chapter shall also apply to areas outside of the special flood hazard areas as prescribed in section 14-19. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-5. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-6. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-7. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, which imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-8. - Partial invalidity and severability. 
    If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the remainder of the chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in force. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-9. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land areas outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create a liability on the part of Surfside Beach or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-10. - Penalties for violation. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person or corporation who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), or imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days, or both. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

A minimum of three (3) inspections shall be performed for each permitted development project in the regulated floodplain: 
    The first inspection is conducted when the site is staked out or otherwise marked. A "construction drawings" elevation certification is provided to the town. The inspector checks that areas subject to special requirements are clearly marked on the ground. 
    The second inspection is conducted when the lowest floor is built for a building or building addition. The builder provides the town with documentation of the surveyed lowest floor elevation ("building under construction" elevation certificate). The inspector checks that: 
a.  The foundation or forms for the structure are correctly located on the site; 
b.  Where buildings have enclosures below the base flood elevation (permitted in AE zones only), the location and size of the openings are as specified on the approved plans; and 
c.  In coastal high hazard areas V, VE, V130 or Coastal A zones, slabs placed under the building are not connected to the foundation. 
    The third inspection is conducted when the project is finished; the "finished construction" elevation certificate is submitted, and before the final building inspection. The inspector checks: 
a.  The foundation and floor elevation have not been altered since the second inspection; 
b.  All areas below the required elevation are constructed with materials resistant to flood damage and do not exceed the allowed square footage (or for those buildings in the V, VE, or V130 and Coastal A Zones-no areas are enclosed below the required elevation); 
c.  Where buildings have enclosures below the base flood elevation (permitted in AE zones only), the location and size of the openings are specified on the approved plans and recorded on the elevation certificate. 
d.  All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning, ductwork, and other equipment is located, elevated, or protected as specified on the approved plans and recorded on the elevation certificate. 
e.  There has been no alteration of the ground since the second inspection or the ground has been graded according to the approved plans. 
(2)  Stop work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this chapter, the administrator or his designee may order the work to immediately be stopped. The stop work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. Notification of the property owner is also required. The stop work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop work order shall constitute a misdemeanor. 
(3)  Revocation of permits. The local administrator may revoke and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder and owner in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. 
(4)  Periodic inspections. The local administrator and each member of the inspection department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(5)  Violations to be corrected. When the local administrator finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his duty to notify the owner of the building of the violation. The owner shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property he owns. 
(6)  Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a structure or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the administrator shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail, to his last known address or by personal service, that: 
a.  The building or property is in violation of the flood damage prevention article; 
b.  A hearing will be held before the local administrator at a designated place and time, not later than ten (10) days after the date of notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and 
c.  Following the hearing, the local administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the structure, or to remove fill as appears appropriate. 
(7)  Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the administrator shall find that the structure or development is in violation of the flood damage prevention article, he shall make such an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such period, not more than sixty (60) days, the administrator may prescribe; provided that where the administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period that may be feasible. 
(8)  Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order of the Surfside Beach Construction Board of Adjustments and Appeals by giving notice of appeal in writing to the local administrator and the clerk within ten (10) days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the administrator shall be final. The local appeals board shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
(9)  Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a structure or property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the appeals board following an appeal, they shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the discretion of the court. 
(10)  Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared in violation of this ordinance and after all other penalties are exhausted to achieve compliance with this ordinance then the local floodplain administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate a Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with the ordinance. Once a violation has been remedied the local floodplain administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the Section 1316 be rescinded.

Adjacent lot grades shall be measured at a minimum of twenty (20) feet into all adjacent lots. This requirement shall not apply to designated Coastal A zones, V, and VE zones as no fill shall be allowed for structural support in these Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). Only non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, thereby rendering the building free of obstruction prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. See [subsection] 14-22(6) for complete requirements. 
(10)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(11)  New and replacement sanitary sewer shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the systems into floodwaters;

b.  Manufactured homes that are substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which as manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than three (3) feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes as permitted in section 14-18(3)(a) shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement in accordance with section 19-425.39 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, effective date May 25, 1990, as amended. Additionally, the chassis must be elevated a minimum of three (3) feet above the base flood elevation the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements at least equivalent strength. 
(4)  Elevated buildings. New construction, addition and/or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include limited enclosures (allowed only in AE flood zones) in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must be certified by a professional engineer and meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening, 
3.  Only the portion of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area. 
4.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; 
5.  Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher that the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one (1) side of the building. 
b.  Enclosures below lowest floor in AE zones:

Exception: Swimming pools shall be allowed meeting section 14-17(21) of this chapter. 
(6)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-4, are areas designated as floodway. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall be presented to the local administrator: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill or raised slab foundation, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local administrator. Raised slab foundation may be utilized in floodways only when no other practical alternative exists. 
b.  If subsection 14-18(6) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions. 
c.  Reserved. 
d.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection 14-18(3). 
e.  Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife and related uses; also lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations. 
(7)  Fill. Fill and raised slab construction is discouraged because storage capacity is removed from floodplains. Elevating buildings by other methods should be utilized. An applicant shall prove through engineering analysis that fill is the only alternative to raising the building to at least three (3) feet above the base flood elevation, and that the amount of fill used will not affect the flood storage capacity or adversely affect adjacent properties. Slabs of any kind, including raised slab foundations, or stem walls shall not be utilized in the special flood hazard area. Piers, pilings, or flow-through crawlspaces shall be utilized. The following provisions shall apply to any fill placed in the special flood hazard area: 
a.  Fill may not be placed in a floodway unless it is in accordance with subsection 14-18(6); 
b.  Fill may not be placed in tidal or non-tidal wetlands without the required state and federal permits; 
c.  Fill must consist of soil and rock materials only. Dredged material may be used as fill only upon certification of suitability by a registered professional geotechnical engineer. Landfills, rubble fills, dumps and sanitary fills are not permitted in the floodplain; 
d.  Fill used to support structures must be certified by a registered professional engineer for "designed and compacted fill" that meets the criteria of (1) Section 1803.5.8 and Section 1804.5 of the International Building Code, (2) Section 2.4 of ASCE 24, or (3) their equivalent); and must be on fill that has appropriate protection from erosion and scour.

f.  The use of fill shall not increase flooding or cause drainage problems on neighboring properties; 
g.  Fill may not be used for structural support in the coastal high hazard areas (V, VE, or V130). 
(8)  Any unauthorized or construction inconsistent with plans approved by the town will be required to return the area to original conditions. This requirement includes existing properties. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18) 
Sec. 14-19. - Standards for areas outside of the special flood hazard area (SFHA). 
    Other areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation of flood waters due to acts of nature, stormwater drainage and other issues. These properties, although outside of the SFHA, need to be protected. The town wishes to minimize any potential lost due to periodic flooding by enforcing certain requirements within the 100-year and 500-year flood zones. These flood zones have no base flood elevation data therefore the following requirements are to be enforced on all new construction and additions: 
(1)  Minimum finished floor elevation. 
a.  All new non-commercial structures, not located in a special flood hazard area, shall have the lowest floor and all mechanical or electrical equipment, such as compressors, air conditioning units, etc., elevated no less than eighteen (18) inches above the highest adjacent grade of the lot. Final site grading shall insure that ponding of stormwater will not occur beneath the building, nearer than three (3) feet from the building's perimeter or any mechanical or electrical equipment. 
b.  All new commercial structures, not located in a special flood hazard area, shall have the lowest floor and all mechanical or electrical equipment, such as compressors, air conditioning units, etc., elevated not less than eighteen (18) inches above the centerline of the road. Final site grading shall insure that ponding of stormwater will not occur beneath the building, nearer that three (3) feet from the building's perimeter or any mechanical or electrical equipment. 
c.  Non-commercial developable lots outside of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) shall have an average grade of all adjacent lots. A foundation/current conditions survey shall be provided and approved prior to the foundation being poured or piers being filled prior to additional inspections being performed. Adjacent lot grades shall be measured at a minimum of twenty (20) feet into all adjacent lots. 
(2)  Slab on grade foundations shall be prohibited. 
(3)  Enclosed crawl space construction must be designed and certified by a professional engineer to meet the following minimum criteria: 
a.  Provide a minimum of two (2) flood vents on different walls having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
b.  The bottom of all flood vents shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening, 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
(4)  The installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads, hoses, etc., are permitted as long as cutoff devices and backflow devices are installed to prevent contamination of the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to a structure and contents; 
(5)  Gas containers shall be strapped and anchored to prevent floatation or buried below grade and anchored to a reinforced concrete footing. 
(Ord. No. 18-0864, 3-13-18)

Sec. 14-21. - Reserved. 
Sec. 14-22. - Coastal high hazard areas (V, VE, and Coastal A zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-4, are areas designated coastal high hazard areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave wash. The following provisions shall apply within all such areas in addition to those requirements set forth in section 14-17 of this chapter: 
(1)  All new construction, addition and substantial improvements shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide, first line of stable natural vegetation and comply with all applicable Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) setback requirements. 
(2)  All buildings and structures shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than three (3) feet above the base flood elevation level, with all space below the lowest supporting member open so as not to impede the flow of water. 
(3)  All buildings and structures shall be securely anchored on pilings or columns, extending vertically below a grade of sufficient depth and the zone of potential scour, and securely anchored to the subsoil strata. 
(4)  All pilings and columns and the attached structures shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, lateral movement and scour due to the effect of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. 
(5)  A registered professional engineer shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in subsections 14-22(3), (4), (6), (8), (12), (13), (14) and (15) of this chapter. 
(6)  There shall not be fill material used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, thereby rendering the building free of obstruction prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. Only beach-compatible sand may be used. Parking slabs under structures shall be designed without grade beams, a maximum of four (4) inches in thickness, designed to break apart during storm surge scouring. The local administrator shall approve design plans for landscaping aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided analysis by an engineer and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
a.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
b.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
c.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
(7)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes, which would increase potential flood damage. 
(8)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor. 
(9)  No manufactured homes shall be permitted. 
(10)  Recreational vehicles shall not be permitted in coastal high hazard areas. 
(11)  Accessory structures shall be prohibited. 
(12)  Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located at a minimum three (3) feet above the lowest horizontal member so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This requirement does not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for showerheads, hoses, etc., as long as cut-off devices and backflow devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service components and thereby minimize any flood damage to the building. 
(13)  Documentation from a professional engineer must be presented to the planning, building and zoning department stating the slab placed under the building is not connected to the foundation. 
(14)  Enclosures of any kind including but not limited to storage, breakaway walls (including non-supporting), open lattice work or insect screening shall be prohibited below the base flood elevation and required freeboard. Elevators and all stairways shall be permitted provided they meet the minimum requirements of the NFIP. 
(15)  One (1) wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault circuit interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation in residential and commercial construction.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 14-0791, adopted Dec. 9, 2014, amended the former Art. III, §§ 14-46-14-82, and enacted a new Art. III as set out herein. The former Art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 08-0640, adopted July 8, 2008. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 14-46. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known and cited as "The Stormwater Management Ordinance" of the Town of Surfside Beach. 
(Ord. No. 14-0791, Att. A, 12-9-14) 
Sec. 14-47. - Findings of fact. 
    The town finds that inadequately or improperly designed, constructed or maintained drainage facilities and the development of land without due consideration of potential problems associated with stormwater runoff may have significant adverse impact upon the quality of the waters of the community and that in the absence of adequately and properly designed, constructed, and maintained facilities, the following situations have occurred and may occur again which have potential adverse impact on the public's health, safety and welfare: 
(1)  Unregulated land use changes may result in increased rates and volumes of stormwater runoff, contributing to local and area flooding, which is potentially harmful to human health, welfare, and safety, and creates a risk of harm to property, and unreasonable interference with the enjoyment of life or property. 
(2)  Development requiring the alteration of natural topography or removal of vegetation may increase the rate and volume of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing soil erosion and sedimentation and degrading water quality. 
(3)  The siltation of a drainage facility resulting from increased erosion may significantly decrease the drainage facility's capacity to transport stormwater, thereby increasing the potential for more frequent and aggravated flooding. 
(4)  The piecemeal strategies practiced in the absence of stormwater management techniques most often result in increased off-site flooding, erosion, and property damage. 
(5)  Uncontrolled surface water runoff carries pollutants, including nutrients, heavy metals, debris, oils, and greases, into receiving bodies thereby degrading their water quality. 
(6)  Increased rates and volumes of stormwater discharged onto the beach may further increase beach erosion, reducing the aesthetic value of the beach and increasing the potential for property damage to oceanfront structures. 
(7)  The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) phase II municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) permit requires the town to implement a stormwater management program that meets the requirements of the Clean Water Act. 
(Ord. No. 14-0791, Att. A, 12-9-14) 
Sec. 14-48. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article include the following: 
(1)  Protect, maintain, and enhance the short-term and long-term public health, safety, and general welfare. This objective will be achieved by: 
a.  Establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff associated with both future land development and existing developed land within the Town of Surfside Beach; 
b.  Providing proper management of stormwater runoff to minimize damage to public and private property and reduce the effects of land disturbing activities on land and stream channel erosion; 
c.  Protecting, preserving, and enhancing water quality and fish and wildlife habitat within the Town of Surfside Beach and in downstream receiving waters; and, 
d.  Alleviate street and property flooding and its adverse impacts caused by urban development. 
(2)  Comply with state and federal (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act. These requirements include: 
a.  Control pollutants from stormwater discharges associated with commercial and industrial activity and the quality of stormwater discharge from residential, commercial and industrial developments; 
b.  Prohibit illicit connections to the stormwater drainage system; 
c.  Control discharges to the stormwater drainage system from spills and dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater; 
d.  Control, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of pollutants from one (1) municipal system to another. 
(3)  Require plans to minimize the transport of pollutants to the local stormwater drainage system by requiring approval and implementation of stormwater management and sediment control plans. 
(4)  Establish procedures, which minimize damage from flooding caused by development, while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial. 
(5)  Require construction, where possible, of drainage facilities/systems, which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems. 
(6)  Establish procedures for the planning and implementation of stormwater improvements using a basin-wide or sub-basin approach which considers the total stormwater basin system, or major portions of the basin system, beyond individual subdivisions and developments. 
(7)  To design, construct, and maintain stormwater management facilities to minimize mosquito-related problems. 
(8)  To protect the water quality of the ocean and the physical characteristics of the beach area by minimizing the rates, volumes, and velocities of stormwater entering drainage systems discharging to the beach.

(5)  An estimate of project start and completion dates, estimates of the number of acres of the site, and a certification that a stormwater plan has been performed for the facility in accordance with the guidance provided in this section. 
(6)  Proposed compliance methods such as, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Option A. Infiltration. 
b.  Option B. Biofiltration swale. 
c.  Option C. Driveway drain storage. 
(7)  A geotechnical investigation report containing at a minimum, boring log and reporting, an adequate description of the soils on site with conclusions and recommendations regarding: 
a.  The infiltration rate. 
b.  Depth to groundwater. 
(b)  Stormwater controls and measures guidelines. Each plan must include a description of appropriate stormwater controls and measures that will be implemented at the construction site. If the following guidance is sufficient to meet specific site constraints, the drawings in the section can suffice. 
(1)  Option A-Infiltration; purpose. Infiltration systems are used primarily as water quality management practices. Stored runoff gradually infiltrates into the surrounding soil. The surface of the system can be covered with grating and/or consist of stone, gabion, sand or a grassed area with a surface inlet. Utilizing underground pipes within the trench can increase the temporary storage capacity of the system and can sometimes provide storage for flooding control. 
a.  Infiltration systems are suitable for use where the subsoil is sufficiently permeable to provide a reasonable rate of infiltration. They are also practical where the water table is sufficiently lower than the design depth of the facility to prevent pollution of the groundwater. 
b.  Infiltration systems are not practical for large drainage areas. Generally, infiltration systems should be limited to five (5) acres. Multiple systems can be considered. 
c.  Infiltration practices are generally suited for low to medium density development (thirty-eight (38) percent to sixty-six (66) percent impervious cover). 
d.  Determine if the development conditions and drainage area are appropriate for an infiltration system application. 
e.  Infiltration systems are assumed to have rectangular cross-sections. 
f.  All systems should be designed to capture sediment prior to entering the reservoir. 
g.  Backfill material for the system should be clean aggregate with a maximum diameter of three and one-half (3.5) inches and a minimum of one and one-half (1.5) inches. Void space should be forty (40) percent. 
h.  An eight-inch deep bottom sand layer is required for all systems to promote better drainage and reduce the risk of soil compaction when backfilled with stone. 
i.  The aggregate fill material should be surrounded with an engineered filter fabric. 
j.  A nonerosive overflow channel leading to a stabilized watercourse should be provided, as necessary, to insure that uncontrolled, erosive, concentrated flow does not develop. 
k.  Provide for maintenance and inspection. A catch basin should be installed for every fifty (50) feet of infiltration system. The catch basin should be placed in the middle of the system. 
l.  No fencing, landscaping, or any other permanent establishment of any kind can be set within or upon the infiltration system. 
(2)  Option B-Biofiltration swale; purpose. The purpose of a biofiltration swale is to convey stormwater runoff at a nonerosive velocity in order to enhance its water quality through infiltration, sedimentation and filtration. Check dams are used within the swale to slow the rate and create small, temporary retention areas. 
a.  A biofiltration swale is a broad and shallow earthen channel vegetated with erosion-resistant and flood-tolerant grasses. Check dams are strategically placed in the swale to encourage retention behind them. The swale must be underlain by an appropriate or engineered soil to provide for infiltration. 
b.  Grassed swales engineered for enhancing water quality control cannot convey large flows. The contributing drainage areas must be kept small. Grassed swales are generally suited to densities of development (sixteen (16) percent to thirty-seven (37) percent impervious). 
c.  Soils should have moderate to high infiltration rates of twenty-seven hundredths (0.27) inches per hour or greater. 
d.  Depth to water table should be at least three (3) feet. 
e.  Determine if the development conditions and drainage area are appropriate for an infiltration system application. 
f.  A swale should have a trapezoidal cross-section to spread flows across its flat bottom. Minimum bottom width should be two (2) feet and maximum six (6) feet in order to maintain sheet flow across the bottom and to avoid concentration of low flows. 
g.  Flow depth is determined by vegetation height and hydraulics. 
h.  Velocity should be no greater than one and one-half (1.5) feet per second. Maximum design velocity is five (5) feet per second. 
i.  The minimum slope is between three-fourths (0.75) and one (1) percent. The maximum slope depends upon what is needed to maintain the desired flow velocities to provide adequate storage. Generally, longitudinal slope should be between one (1) to three (3) percent. The slope should never exceed five (5) percent. 
j.  A swale should have the capacity to convey the peak flows from a ten-year event without exceeding the maximum permissible velocities. 
k.  Vegetation must be maintained to design standards with a dense cover of water-tolerant, erosion-resistant species. Appropriate vegetative species for use in the swale are, but not limited to, tall fescue, reed canary grass, redtop, bulls tongue, and others. 
l.  Check dam maximum height is eighteen (18) inches and should not exceed one- half (1/2) the height of the swale bank. Filter fabric is required under riprap check dams. Dams should be placed at the discharge point of the swale. 
m.  Provide for maintenance and inspection. 
n.  No fencing, landscaping or any other permanent establishment of any kind can be set within or upon the infiltration system. 
(3)  Option C-Driveway drain storage. The purpose of driveway drain storage is to store and treat stormwater runoff through infiltration, sedimentation and filtration, the grades, subsoils, drainage characteristics, and groundwater conditions are suitable. 
a.  Slopes must be less than five (5) percent. 
b.  Soils must be verified. 
c.  The contributing drainage areas must be kept small. Soils should have moderate to high infiltration rates of twenty-seven hundredths (0.27) inches per hour or greater. 
d.  Depth to water table should be at least three (3) feet. 
e.  Any other stormwater entering area must be pretreated. 
f.  Driveway drains must be placed over a highly permeable layer of open-graded gravel or crushed stone. The void spaces in the aggregate layers act as the storage reservoir for stormwater. 
g.  Filter fabric is placed beneath the gravel and stone layers to screen out fine soil particles. 
h.  Perforated pipe may be added to discharge excess stormwater after the reservoir is filled. 
i.  Provide for maintenance and inspection.

(b)  Receiving water stage. 
(1)  Regulated systems. Existing design and maintained stage elevations will be available from the building department. 
(2)  Nonregulated systems. The applicant should compute receiving water states for such systems from the best available data and submit the results to the building department for review and concurrence before utilizing such results in further computations. 
(3)  Any system. Tail water stages should be considered if they have a significant influence on the design. 
    All stormwater management system designs should address the following at a minimum: 
Must be designed, constructed and maintained in a manner which regulates and controls post-development runoff to levels equivalent to or less than pre-development conditions for the two-year, ten-year, 25-year and 100-year design storms. 
Must be designed, constructed and maintained to manage rainfall on-site and prevent the off-site discharge of one (1) inch of runoff from the site's disturbed area. 
(a)  Detention/retention. 
(1)  At a minimum, adequate storage volume shall be provided to manage rainfall on-site and prevent the off-site discharge of one (1) inch of runoff from the site's disturbed area. For soil conditions or groundwater table conditions which do not permit the percolation of this volume within the three (3) days following a storm event, the building department may approve detention with filtration systems in lieu of retention. 
(2)  Outlet facilities shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering principles, with particular attention given to appropriate hydraulics, including orifice, weir, and culvert hydraulics. 
(3)  Outlet facilities shall be so designed to attenuate the post-development peak discharge rates of two-year, ten-year, and 25-year, 24-hour storms to be less than or equal to the peak rates of the pre-developed state of the site. 
(4)  Where the detention/retention basin discharges into a stream, ditch, swale, or water body, an energy dissipater may be required by the building department to reduce discharge velocities in order to minimize soil erosion and sediment transport. 
(5)  For detention and retention basins, an emergency spillway may be required by the building department to discharge flows in excess of the 25-year, 24-hour storm event. The spillway shall be designed to accommodate the peak discharge rate occurring from a 100-year, 24-hour storm event. The spillway shall be so located that the discharge does not erode the basin or receiving channel. 
(6)  The design of retention/detention areas shall incorporate considerations for regular maintenance and vegetation management procedures. 
(b)  Subsurface infiltration systems. 
(1)  Subsurface infiltration shall be designed on the basis of actual test data completed by a licensed geotechnical professional. Tests shall be consistent as to soils, elevations, locations, and water table depths with the system design to which the test data will be applied. 
(2)  Subsurface percolation systems shall be designed for prevention of clogging by fine material and for ease of cleaning with conventional sewer cleaning equipment. This may include, but not necessarily be limited to, wrapping of the perforated pipe and the seepage trench with an appropriate fabric and providing sufficient cleanouts to the system. 
(3)  Systems shall have an overflow with a control device to a watercourse between the subsurface percolation system and the discharge pipe. The overflow or control device shall be sized for the allowable discharge. 
(c)  Impervious areas. Runoff shall be discharged from impervious surfaces through retention areas, detention devices, filtering and cleansing devices prior to discharge from the project site. 
(d)  Stagnant water conditions. Configurations which create stagnant water conditions, such as hydraulically dead-end canals, are to be avoided regardless of the type of development. 
(e)  Stormwater management areas. Areas to be utilized for the conveyance or storage of stormwater shall be legally reserved for that purpose by plat, easement, etc., so that subsequent owners or others may not remove such areas from their intended use. 
(f)  Runoff from adjacent lands. Runoff from adjacent or upstream lands shall be considered, and provision for unimpeded conveyance of such runoff shall be included in drainage plans. 
(g)  Plan wetlands criteria. Wetlands areas shall not be disturbed until documentation is provided to the town engineer to show that the applicant has received approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regarding appropriate permits and approval of development activities. No stormwater shall be discharged directly into any wetlands unless first being treated through an approved water quality BMP. 
(Ord. No. 14-0791, Att. A(14-75), 12-9-14) 
Sec. 14-82. - Soil erosion and sediment control plan. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the soil erosion and sediment control plan is to provide effective measures to control erosion and sedimentation generated by removal of ground surface cover. 
(b)  General principles. 
(1)  Erosion and sedimentation control requires consideration of stormwater control and soil to be encountered in order to be effective. 
(2)  Proper design shall include measures for erosion control and provide for the early establishment of vegetation that will help to avoid erosion problems during and after development activities. 
(3)  Alignment, grades, area of disturbed soil and bank slopes shall be based on soil erodibility, climatic exposure, geology, proposed vegetative restoration and expected maintenance. 
(c)  Guidelines for design. 
(1)  Slopes should be protected from erosion by quick establishment of vegetative cover, benches or terraces, slope protection structures, mulches, or a combination of these practices as required. Sod is the preferred method of stabilization. 
(2)  Drainage channels should be designed to avoid erosion problems. Wide channels with flat side slopes lined with grass or other vegetation shall be utilized where feasible. Where channel gradients are steep, concrete linings or grade control structures, such as stone check dams, may be required. Every effort should be made to preserve natural channels. 
(3)  Sediment basins shall be constructed to discharge stormwater runoff while trapping sediment loads. Sediment basins may either be temporary or permanent, as required by the building department. 
(4)  Detention basins may also be used to trap sediment during and after development. Where used for this purpose, the basins shall continue to detain stormwater in accordance with the hydraulic design criteria, but allow for the settlement and containment of sediment in the basin. Sediment shall be removed periodically to ensure the intended performance of the detention basin. 
(5)  Existing vegetation, adequate to control erosion, shall be preserved. Regeneration of wood plants shall be encouraged. 
(6)  Sediment tubes, riprap, or silt fences may be placed around storm sewer inlets and at the boundaries of disturbed areas to trap sediment on site. 
(d)  Contents. Each soil erosion and sediment control plan shall contain the following: 
(1)  Location, scope, and manner of performing sediment and erosion control measures; 
(2)  Proposed construction sequence and time schedule for all earth disturbing activities and installation of provisions for sediment and erosion control. The sequence and phasing shall take into account exposing the smallest practical areas for the shortest period of time and retain as much natural vegetation as possible to prevent erosion; 
(3)  Design computations and applicable assumptions for all structural measures for sediment and erosion control. Volume and velocity must be given for all surface water conveyance measures and piped outfalls; 
(4)  All components of a stormwater pollution prevention plan as outlined by DHEC. Sediment control practices shall be used around the perimeter of the site to prevent off-site sediment damage; 
(5)  Methods to be used for controlling dust during construction; 
(6)  Proposed construction sequence and time schedule for all earth disturbing activities and installation of provisions for erosion and sediment control and stormwater management; and 
(7)  Design computations and applicable assumptions for all structural measures for erosion and sediment control. Volume and velocity must be given for all surface water conveyance measures and pipe discharges.

It is further the intent of this review process, to enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. 
(c)  The development administrator shall review and approve, approve with conditions or other modifications, or disapprove the sketch plan within fifteen (15) days from the date the sketch plan was submitted to the administrator. Pertinent comments regarding the sketch plan shall be provided to the subdivider in writing. The failure of the administrator to act within the time prescribed above shall constitute an approval and a letter to that effect shall be issued by the development administrator upon demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. Upon approval of the sketch plan, the subdivider may prepare and submit a preliminary plat to the planning commission. The disapproval of a sketch plan may be appealed to the planning commission as provided in Article II. 
(d)  Effect of sketch plan approval. The approval of the sketch plan by the development administrator does not permit the subdivider to undertake or perform public improvements, including streets and utilities, or make any other improvements as regulated herein. The approval of the sketch plan shall be valid for one hundred eighty (180) days; thereafter, if no preliminary plat has been submitted such approval shall be considered void.

Section. 15-322. - Preliminary plat required; review by commission; time limitation; effect. 
(a)  Submission. Following the approval of a sketch plan, the subdivider may proceed with the submission of a preliminary plat for consideration by the planning commission. The subdivider shall submit two (2) copies of a completed application form, ten (10) black line copies of the plat, one (1) reproducible copy (Mylar or similar medium) and any required supplemental data to the development administrator not less than ten (10) working days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. 
(b)  Development administrator's review and report. Upon receipt, the development administrator shall review the preliminary plat for conformity with this chapter and shall transmit copies of the plat to the planning commission. The administrator shall refer copies of the plat and any attachments to those public officials and agencies which are concerned with new development, including but not limited to the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control, Grand Strand Water and Sewer Authority, District Engineer of the S.C. Department of Transportation, telephone company, S.C. Electric and Gas Company, the cable television company, the Surfside Beach Public Works Department, and any other town departments or agencies deemed necessary by the administrator. The administrator shall prepare and distribute a written report on the requested preliminary plat approval to the commission and subdivider. The administrator's report may incorporate comments received from other departments or agencies. The administrator's report shall include an analysis of the proposed subdivision's conformance with these regulations and may include other pertinent information and/or recommendations. 
(c)  Planning commission's review procedures. The planning commission shall review and act upon the preliminary plat within sixty (60) days as prescribed in section 15-203. If no action is taken by the commission within this time, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been approved; however, the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of said time period. Action taken by the commission shall be at a scheduled public meeting and notice of the time and place of said meeting be sent by registered or certified mail to the name and address specified on or accompanying the preliminary plat. Such notice shall be sent not less than five (5) days before the date fixed for the meeting. At the meeting, the planning commission shall either approve, approve with modification, disapprove, or, where additional information is needed, defer action on the preliminary plat. Notice of any action taken by the commission shall be in writing, signed by the chairman, and forwarded to the subdivider. In case of disapproval, the reasons for disapproval shall be addressed in relation to those parts of this chapter with which the plat does not conform. One (1) copy of the reasons shall be retained in the records of the commission and one (1) copy forwarded to the subdivider. On approval with modifications, the commission may require the subdivider to resubmit the preliminary plat with all recommended modifications to the commission before approval is given to the preliminary plat. 
(d)  Effect of the preliminary plat approval. Approval of the preliminary plat is a conditional approval and does not constitute approval of the final plat. Preliminary plat approval shall be authorization for the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the final plat and design the installation of site improvements subject to the requirements imposed by Article IV of this chapter. The approval of a preliminary plat shall not authorize the sale or transfer of lots. 
(e)  Expiration of approval. The subdivider shall have two (2) years from the date on which the preliminary plat was approved or conditionally approved to submit and have approved a final plat for the subdivision. Failure by the subdivider to submit and have approved a final plat within this time period shall void the approval of the preliminary plat. The subdivider may request and the commission may grant an extension to the time limitation subject to the vested rights provisions contained in section 14.5-2 of this Code. The failure of the subdivider to request an extension as provided in section 14.5-2 shall constitute a forfeiture of the original approval. 
(f)  Amendments to an approved preliminary plat. The subdivider may request and the development administrator may authorize minor amendments to an approved preliminary plat. Such amendments, when authorized, shall not require the resubmission or reconsideration of the preliminary plat prior to the review of a final plat. The subdivider's request and the administrator's authorization shall be in writing. Minor amendments do not include a change(s) that would: 
(1)  Result in an increase in the number of lots; 
(2)  Alter the exterior boundary of the subdivision through the addition or removal of land; 
(3)  Alter the proposed right-of-way or alter the extent or location of any improvement to be dedicated to the town; 
(4)  Be contrary to these regulations or require the granting of a design modification as provided in section 15-240 et seq.; and/or 
(5)  Be contrary to any condition of approval or, in the opinion of the administrator, exceed the scope of the planning commission's original approval. 
    Changes or other alterations from an approved preliminary plat, not constituting a "minor amendment", shall require the plat's reconsideration by the commission prior to the submission of a final plat. When minor amendments are authorized, the development administrator shall provide a copy of the written determination to the commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The written determination shall be entered into the commission's minutes.

Electric and Gas Company, the cable television company, the Surfside Beach Public Works Department, and any other town departments or agencies deemed necessary by the administrator. The administrator shall prepare and distribute a written report on the requested final plat approval to the commission and subdivider. The administrator's report may incorporate comments received from other departments or agencies. The administrator's report shall include an analysis of the proposed subdivision's conformance with these regulations and may include other pertinent information and/or recommendations. 
(c)  Planning commission procedure. The planning commission shall review and act upon the final plat within sixty (60) days as prescribed in section 15-203.

Recording the final plat shall constitute an irrevocable offer to dedicate all streets and other public ways shown on the plat and to dedicate or reserve, as specified by the commission, all park reservations and other such areas to the public use. Recording of the plat, however, shall not impose any duty by the town concerning acceptance of such dedicated streets or dedicated or reserved areas, until the Surfside Beach Town Council has made the proper acceptance. 
(f)  Expiration of approval. The subdivider shall have two (2) years from the date on which the final plat was approved or conditionally approved to submit such plat for signature and recording.

The development administrator shall promptly mail notice of the decision and shall note the date that written notification was mailed to the subdivider. The failure of the administrator to act within the time specified by this subsection shall not constitute an approval but shall immediately cause the plat to be referred to the planning commission for a decision, with notice of such referral sent to the subdivider by registered or certified mail. Such notice shall be mailed at least five (5) day prior to the meeting on which the plat is to be considered. In no case shall such referral and decision exceed the time limitation, applicable to the administrator, as provided in section 15-203.

Upon the approval of the final plat and the subdivider's compliance with the requirements of subsection (e) above, the administrator shall sign the "Certificate of Approval for Recording" with two (2) signed black line copies returned to the subdivider. This print becomes the instrument (record plat) to be recorded in the Office of the Horry County Register of Deeds. The subdivider shall record a signed copy in this office within fifteen (15) days of the date of signature appearing in the "Certificate of Approval for Recording Plat". Failure to meet the fifteen (15) day deadline shall cause the approval of the administrator to be null and void, unless an extension of this time is granted in writing by the administrator upon written request by the subdivider. 
(g)  Expiration of approval. The subdivider shall have two (2) years from the date on which a final plat was approved or conditionally approved by the development administrator to submit such plat for signature and recording. Failure of the subdivider to submit a final (record) plat within this time period shall void the plat's approval. The subdivider may request and the administrator may grant an extension to this time limitation pursuant to the vested rights provisions contained in section 14.5-2 of this Code. When such extensions are granted, they shall be reported to the planning commission at the next regularly scheduled meeting and the nature of such extension shall be recorded in the minutes of the planning commission. The failure of the applicant to formally request an extension as provided in section 14.5-2 shall constitute a forfeiture of approval.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Section. 15-400. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to establish standards for the design and installation of improvements within subdivisions and other land developments. A well designed development means little to prospective lot buyers, tenants, and/or prospective users until raw land is physically transformed into lots or building sites and all necessary improvements are provided. In order for new subdivisions and developments to be a community asset rather than a liability, the developer shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-401. - Provisions of this article to be construed as minimum standards. 
    The design and improvement standards contained herein shall be considered the minimum requirements. The planning commission or development administrator may require design elements or improvements in addition to those outlined herein where deemed necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter or to ensure compliance with other Code provisions applicable to a development. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-402. - Conformance with applicable rules and regulations. 
    In addition to the regulations set forth herein, the design, construction, and/or dedication of improvements shall comply with the following laws, rules, and regulations: 
(1)  All applicable federal laws including the administrative regulations promulgated by federal departments and agencies; 
(2)  All applicable provisions contained in the South Carolina Code of Laws or South Carolina Code of Regulations; 
(3)  All jurisdictional ordinances;

Section. 15-462. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  When a new street(s) is to be dedicated or in cases where a sidewalk(s) is planned as part of a development proposal, sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section and SCDOT's specifications. The construction and dedication of sidewalks shall be concurrent with the construction and dedication of streets as provided by this division. 
(b)  Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of the street for all zoning districts and planned developments, except the R-1 and R-2 Districts. In the R-1 and R-2 Districts, sidewalks shall be constructed, at a minimum, the full length of one (1) street side. 
(c)  Sidewalks shall be constructed to a sufficient width, slope, and provide ramping to ensure accessibility as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The minimum width for sidewalks constructed hereafter is provided in Table 15-462 below: 
Table 15-462 

Minimum Sidewalk Width Street Type Minimum Sidewalk Width Local Street 5 feet Marginal Access Street 5 feet Collector Street 7 feet Arterial Street 9 feet  
    Where a new sidewalk will serve as an extension to an existing sidewalk having a greater width than provided in Table 15-462, the planning commission may require that the new sidewalk be constructed at a width equal to the width of the existing sidewalk. 
(d)  All new sidewalks shall be constructed within the dedicated right-of-way. In residential districts the sidewalk shall be setback a minimum of eighteen (18) inches from the back of the street curb. The area between the sidewalk and the street curb or surface shall be landscaped with grass. Where other plantings are proposed by a developer, the planning commission may approve such plantings subsequent to a recommendation from the public works director.

(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-464. - Pedestrian paths. 
(a)  The inclusion of pedestrian paths in development design is optional. Where provided, pedestrian paths shall be constructed of durable materials such as concrete, asphalt, pavers, gravel, or similar materials. Pedestrian paths and crossings located within a street right-of-way shall be constructed to the same standards and materials applicable to sidewalks. Pedestrian paths located outside of a dedicated right-of-way shall be maintained by the developer or homeowner's association. 
(b)  Where pedestrian paths are provided in planned development districts, the planning commission may reduce, through design modification, the requirement for sidewalks as provided in section 15-462. Such reduction shall only be granted in instances where: 
(1)  Access to individual lots would be accomplished through pedestrian paths in a manner similar to that accomplished through the provision of sidewalks; 
(2)  The provision of pedestrian paths, in lieu of sidewalks, would facilitate an optimum development design; 
(3)  The pedestrian path is located within an easement of no less than fifteen (15) feet in width and public access to the path is unrestricted; 
(4)  The pedestrian path is improved to a width equal to or greater than would be required for a sidewalk placement. The width, surface materials, and slope are sufficient to accommodate access and the path would comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act;

DIVISION 6. - IMPROVEMENT CONSTRUCTION AND ACCEPTANCE 

Section. 15-469. - Purpose and intent of division. 
    This division establishes the procedures for the dedication, construction, and acceptance of streets and in-right-of-way infrastructure. It is the intent of this division to establish a seamless process for the transfer of streets, sidewalks, and other street features into public ownership and maintenance. Where the dedication, construction, and acceptance of infrastructure, such as utilities, are governed by the rules and procedures of non-municipal agencies or other chapters of this Code, the developer shall follow such rules and procedures. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-470. - Street construction plans and other documents. 
(a)  Plan required. Street construction shall not commence until a preliminary plat, illustrating the proposed street, has been approved by the planning commission and street construction plans, consistent with the requirements of this article, have been submitted to and approved by the development administrator. Construction plans shall be prepared by a licensed engineer and shall consist of three (3) blue or black line copies of the proposed construction on sheet sizes of twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches. The following information shall be shown: 
(1)  Street profiles. The final grades of each street shall be shown at a horizontal scale equal to one-tenth ( 1/10 ) of the horizontal scale. 
(2)  Street cross-section. A scale of one (1) inch to ten (10) feet shall be used to show the cross-section of each new street. The cross-section shall include pavement width, curb, gutters, sidewalks, utility locations, and, where applicable, designated on-street parking. 
(3)  Miscellaneous depictions. Drainage easements, rights-of-way improvements including the location of sidewalks, manholes, and catch basins, street signs, street lights, the location, size and invert elevations of existing and proposed sanitary sewers, stormwater drains, and all underground utilities including fire hydrant hook ups shall be illustrated. 
(4)  Other materials. When the proposed subdivision or development is only a portion of the owner's holdings and intentions are for future development, a sketch plan illustrating the street layout and proposed lots of the remaining tract is required. 
(b)  Plan approval. The development administrator shall coordinate the review of construction drawings and other documents with the public works director. The development administrator's written determination shall incorporate any comments or conditions of approval as submitted by the public works department. The development administrator shall have sixty (60) days following the submission of the street construction plan to approve, approve with conditions or other modifications, or disapprove the plan. The sixty (60) day timeline may be extended with the mutual agreement of the applicant and the development administrator. The failure of the development administrator to act within sixty (60) days or within any agreed extension shall constitute approval of the plan; however, the failure of the administrator to act on the request shall not bind the town council to accept any street into public maintenance which does not meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(c)  Dedication documents. Prior to the start of construction, the developer shall submit to the development administrator a Right-of-Way Deed, Warrant Agreement, Joinder and Consent to Dedicate, and all other pertinent documents required by the planning commission or the town's attorney necessary to convey title to the right-of-way once the street(s) has been constructed and accepted by town council. The final (record) plat shall not be signed until these documents are received and a surety instrument has been posted in accordance with Article VI, Division 1 (sample documents are included in Appendices A. and B.). 
(d)  Start of construction. Upon plan approval and acceptance of dedication documents, the approval of all other regulatory permits, and following a pre-construction conference attended by the project contractor, the development administrator, and the public works director, construction may commence. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-471. - Inspections. 
(a)  The development administrator shall coordinate the inspection of improvements with the public works department.

(b)  A minimum of two (2) working days notice must be given by the developer for any requested inspection. If subsequent work is done prior to inspection, it is done at the developer's own risk and may, upon a decision of the administrator, be required to be removed and reinstalled or have the quality substantiated by additional tests as determined by the development administrator. In the event that weather or construction activities result in changes to approved conditions or in the case of a failed inspection, re-inspection shall be required before proceeding to the next stage of construction. All approved inspections shall be valid for a maximum of thirty (30) days. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-472. - As-built plan required. 
    Following the completion of the all in-right-of-way construction, the developer shall submit to the development administrator three (3) copies of an "as built" plan documenting the condition of the improvements.

(8)  Any additional information deemed necessary by the development administrator or public works director to accurately depict improvements or unusual conditions. 
    In the event the "as-built" plan shows that field changes were made, or significant differences exist from the design plans, the design engineer or another civil engineer shall certify that the changes or differences are not detrimental and that the system will still meet the minimum standards of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-473. - Acceptance by town council. 
    The town council may accept a street and other in-right-of-way improvements into public maintenance when such improvements are installed in accordance with these regulations. The acceptance by the town council must be preceded by the referral of the acceptance request to the planning commission for a recommendation and the posting of an acceptable warranty instrument as provided in section 15-605(c) of this chapter. The town council shall not be obligated to accept any improvement where the developer has failed to follow the design, construction, or procedural requirements of this chapter.

DIVISION 3. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS 

Section. 15-530. - Intent. 
    It is not the intent of these regulations to freeze new developments into any single type of design. It is, however, the intent of these regulations to ensure that all new developments shall contribute to the building of economically sound and desirable living areas within the community with all necessary services and facilities. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-531. - Application of development regulation standards. 
(a)  Except as provided herein, the platting and design standards as specified by this chapter shall apply to all planned developments and affected districts. 
(b)  In order to provide the developer with maximum flexibility in the design and character of new planned developments, the planning commission is hereby authorized to recommend to the town council to modify the standards and requirements of these regulations in the case of a plan for a planned development which, in the judgment of the planning commission, provides adequate public spaces for the circulation, recreation, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, and which also provides those covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity to and achievement of the plan. Any modification to the applicable standards shall constitute an amendment to these regulations. In addition to the zoning amendment requirements specified by Chapter 17 of this Code, a planned development proposal permitting deviation from the standards of these regulations shall follow the amendment procedures specified in Article II of this chapter.

ARTICLE VI. - SUPPLEMENTAL EXHIBITS 
DIVISION 1. - SURETY INSTRUMENTS 

Section. 15-600. - Purpose. 
    The developer shall bear the cost of all public improvements required by this chapter. It is recognized that the developer's need to receive final plan or plat approval may precede the installation and acceptance of public improvements. It is the purpose of this division to provide reasonable accommodation to a developer while guarding the fiscal interests of the town and its residents. This division provides a mechanism by which a developer can receive final approval prior to the acceptance of improvements, provided sufficient financial guarantees have been established to ensure their timely installation and acceptance. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-601. - Surety instruments authorized; refusal. 
(a)  A surety instrument may be posted to allow for the recording of a final plat or to obtain zoning, building, or other required permits prior to the installation and acceptance of required improvements. Acceptable surety instruments shall include irrevocable letters of credit or cash deposits. The form and sufficiency of surety instruments shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission or, where delegated or in cases involving permits, the development administrator. 
(b)  Approved surety instruments shall be independent of the developer's project construction loan. The commission or development administrator shall not accept any surety instrument that requires draw downs for monthly expenditures. Payment of monthly expenditures does not affect the amount of money held by the town in a surety instrument. 
(c)  Acceptance of a surety instrument is discretionary. The planning commission and development administrator reserve the right to refuse, for cause, a surety instrument for any remaining improvements and require that such improvements be completed before the recording of a plat and/or prior to the issuance of a building or zoning permit. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-602. - Cost estimate required; amount of surety; time limit for completion of improvements. 
(a)  Cost estimate. The developer shall submit to the development administrator a detailed itemized unit cost estimate for the proposed public improvements to be guaranteed by the surety instrument. The cost estimate shall include material costs and the cost of installation. Such estimates shall bear the original signature of a licensed professional engineer.

(1)  Water and sewer systems; 
(2)  Stormwater management systems (basins, ditching, drains, etc) and storm sewers; 
(3)  Street improvements including grading, surfacing, curbs, gutters, culverts, temporary cul-de-sacs, street signs, lighting, and grassing or landscaping; 
(4)  Fire hydrants; and/or 
(5)  Underground electric service. 
    The planning commission shall verify the sufficiency of the estimate with the appropriate department or agency responsible for the inspection and/or acceptance of the required public improvement. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the cost estimate, the planning commission shall either approve or deny the cost estimate. Determinations of the commission shall be in writing. If denied, the commission shall state the reasons for the denial. Where delegated by the commission or in cases not involving major subdivisions, the development administrator is authorized to approve or deny a cost estimate. 
(b)  Amount of surety and form. Upon approval of the cost estimate, the developer shall submit to the development administrator a surety instrument in an amount not less than one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the approved estimate. Surety instruments shall be accompanied by an application form. The development administrator may accept a letter of credit that substantially conforms to the format as provided in Appendix A. In cases where a cash deposit is provided, the developer shall submit a cashier's check, payable to the Town of Surfside Beach. Such check shall bear an expiration date of not less than one (1) year. The town clerk shall, after the acceptance of an application and surety agreement by the development administrator, cause such funds to be deposited in a special account, separate from other funds of the town, bearing interest at the short term rate prevailing in the market (See Appendix A). 
(c)  Time limit and extension. All improvements guaranteed by a surety instrument shall be completed and accepted within one (1) year of the posting of such instrument. The planning commission or development administrator may authorize one (1) extension of the surety for a period not to exceed one (1) additional year. The authorization to extend a surety instrument shall only be granted by the commission or development administrator in cases where the developer demonstrates good cause, i.e. adverse weather conditions or material shortages. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-603. - Reduction. 
    A developer may request and the planning commission or development administrator may grant a reduction in the amount of a letter of credit during the surety's term to reflect work performed. A request to reduce the letter of credit shall be submitted to the administrator and shall include a revised cost estimate. The approval of the cost estimate shall follow the same procedures as specified in section 15-602. The authorization to reduce a letter of credit is discretionary to the commission or development administrator. Requests to reduce a surety, where a cash deposit is posted, shall not be granted. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-604. - Failure to perform; unexpended funds; insufficient surety. 
    The development administrator, planning commission, or town council may draw a letter of credit or authorize the use of a cash deposit when it has been determined that the improvements for which the surety instrument was posted will not be completed in accordance with this Code or within the time frame provided by the surety instrument. Upon such default, the proceeds from a drawn letter of credit or cash deposit shall be used by the town to install the required improvements. The town may assess reasonable administrative costs, not to exceed ten (10) percent of the total value of the surety, incurred in bidding, contract management, and/or oversight of improvements. Any unexpended funds, once construction is complete, shall be released to the financial institution or responsible entity that posted the surety instrument. Where the surety instrument was insufficient to finance the required improvements after the developer defaulted, the town council will assess the developer the cost of the improvements plus any administrative costs over and above the surety amount. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-605. - Release of surety; maintenance warranty for street improvements required. 
(a)  Release of surety. Upon completion of the improvements as required by this chapter, written notice thereof shall be given by the developer to the development administrator, who shall cause an inspection of the improvements to be made. The development administrator will, within thirty (30) days of the date of notice, authorize in writing the release of the surety instrument, provided improvements have been completed and accepted in accordance with the required specifications. 
(b)  Surety release involving new streets. Notwithstanding the time limits imposed by subsection (a), a surety instrument involving the construction and dedication of a new street(s) shall not be released by the development administrator until the street has been accepted into public maintenance by the town council and a warranty has been posted by the developer. If within ninety (90) days of a recommendation from the planning commission, the town council fails to accept a street by ordinance or deny acceptance by resolution, with reasons for such denial stated, the development administrator may release the surety instrument provided a warranty has been established by the developer. 
(c)  Warranty required. Streets that are dedicated and accepted by the town council into public maintenance shall be under warranty for all defects and failures for a period of two (2) years, commencing from the date the ordinance to accept the street(s) is adopted. The warranty shall be in an amount of not less than ten (10) percent of construction costs and shall be in the form of a letter of credit or cash deposit. The form and sufficiency of the warranty shall be subject to the approval of the town council.

DIVISION 2. - DIGITAL SUBMISSION 

Section. 15-620. - Purpose and intent. 
    The advent of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has substantially increased the ability to collect, analyze, share, and store parcel information. GIS assists in the accurate depiction of property for tax purposes, assists in the provision of utility and public safety services, and increases the accuracy of mapping products. GIS and similar electronic media also reduce costs associated with the storage and reproduction of paper documents. 
    The Town of Surfside Beach, like many communities across the country, has begun the process of converting mapping and the storage of parcel information to electronic media. The purpose of this division is to require the submission of GIS compatible digital data for new developments prior to the signing of a final subdivision plat or prior to the issuance of permits. In establishing this requirement, it is recognized that digital data submission may pose difficulties in certain instances. As such, this division provides certain exceptions designed to reduce any hardships imposed on small or minimally intense development proposals. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-621. - Digital submission required; exemptions. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b), prior to the final approval of a new development, a digital copy of plats or plans shall be submitted to the development administrator. Submissions shall be on two (2) Compact Disks or DVD media. An alternative media for the submission of this data may be requested by the applicant and agreed to by the administrator prior to the signing of a final plat or the issuance of a zoning permit. Expressly included by this requirement are: 
(1)  Major subdivisions; 
(2)  Minor subdivisions; 
(3)  Public facilities; 
(4)  All public improvements to be dedicated and accepted by the town for maintenance; 
(5)  Shopping centers; 
(6)  Planned developments; 
(7)  Multifamily or group developments containing more than ten (10) units; and 
(8)  All other developments not exempted by this section. 
(b)  The development administrator may waive the submission of a digital plan copy in instances where, in the opinion of the development administrator, the requirement would impose a substantial hardship on a developer and the project is minimal in scope and intensity. Expressly exempted from the digital submission requirement are: 
(1)  Excepted subdivisions; 
(2)  New commercial or industrial projects on less than one-half (1/2) acre not involving the subdivision of property; 
(3)  Commercial and industrial developments involving building additions of less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet and not involving the subdivision of property; and 
(4)  Residential developments of less than ten (10) units when such units are constructed on an existing lot of record. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-622. - Digital file format. 
    Acceptable file formats include: AutoCAD *.dwg, AutoCAD *.dxf, or other GIS compatible file format. The files must be identical to the relevant significant features on the printed plan and contain all factual information included on the written plan. Upon project completion, a digital submission of the "as-built" plan conforming to the above requirements is required for final release of the surety instrument associated with any project. 
(Ord. No. 12-0709, 1-24-12) 
Section. 15-623. - Digital data standards. 
(a)  All digital mapping data must be delivered in the South Carolina State Plane Coordinate System with a horizontal datum of NAD83, units of U.S. survey feet and a vertical datum of NAVD 88. Each plan must include a minimum of one (1) survey-derived (bearings and distances listed) reference to a permanent in-ground feature such as a catch basin, manhole, stone bound, municipal benchmark, or other readily identifiable marker. The permanent in-ground feature should appear on the plan in its as-built location and include sufficient bearings and distances to be able to locate the feature relative to the property parcel(s). The latitude and longitude of the in-ground feature must be provided with survey grade accuracy (generally accepted to an accuracy of plus or minus one (1) foot). 
(b)  Each feature type must be organized in the CAD or GIS data structure as a separate layer. These may include but are not limited to separate layers for: parcel boundaries, dimensions, buildings, roads, road centerlines, surface water, areas of special flood hazard, and wetlands. Multiple features represented in a single CAD layer or GIS file will not be accepted. Any features submitted in the electronic plan must be represented in their entirety in an individual layer. All data shall be topologically clean, meaning that polygons are closed (no overshoots or undershoots) and lines connect at nodes. 
(c)  Documentation of the data format must be provided with a description of the CAD layers and a list of the types of features placed in each layer. Submission of multiple files must also include a list of the files and a description of their content. 
(d)  The data submitted must include documentation, the name of the person(s) responsible for preparing the data, contact information, and an estimation of the horizontal and vertical accuracy. Also included must be: 
(1)  Date of submission; 
(2)  Street address of submitted plan; 
(3)  Map and lot of submitted plan; 
(4)  Type of lot adjustment (new lot, subdivision, lot line correction, lot combination, easement, other - describe); and 
(5)  Name of engineer or surveyor providing the plan or plat.

Cost Estimate for Improvement 
I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief that the following estimates are accurate and that they have been prepared by a licensed engineer: 
Street Construction (include all design elements) $________ 
Stormwater Management (include design and installation): $________ 
Sidewalks (include design and installation): $________ 
Water/Sewer Improvements: $________ 
Fire Hydrants: $________ 
Other (Specify: ________): $________ 
Total: $________ 
Please attach detailed estimates to this form. 
I understand and agree that the estimates provided above and attached hereto will be provided to the agency or town department having inspection and/or approval responsibilities for the respective improvements. The agency or town department may require monies to be posted in surety which are in excess of those provided above if it is determined that the estimates provided are insufficient to guarantee installation and acceptance. 
Conditions for Acceptance of Letters of Credit 
Responsibility of a Developer in Posting Surety 
I, the owner/developer of the project as indicated above, understand and agree as follows: 
1.  Prior to the establishment of the letter of credit for my project, the cost estimates, as provided above, will be submitted to and approved by Surfside Beach Planning Commission ['commission'] or Development Administrator ['administrator'] as stipulated in the Land Development Regulations of the Town of Surfside Beach, South Carolina. The letter of credit will be provided in an amount equal to 125% of the approved cost estimates for design and installation. 
2.  The letter of credit as issued by the bank must be in a format which is approved by the commission (Please see sample format). 
3.  The letter of credit's term may not be less than six months nor more than one year. Letters of credit issued by or requiring document presentation at branches or main offices outside of Horry County must contain an automatic extension clause, as provided in the sample format. Letters of credit issued by in-county banks with an in-county place of presentation office may, at the discretion of the lending institution, include the automatic extension clause. 
Time Limitation and Responsibility to Notify 
The public improvements as provided herein are to be installed and approved within one year of the posting of the letter of credit. In the event that hardship or unforeseen circumstances prevent the installation of improvements within one year, the commission or administrator may, at its discretion, allow the letter of credit to be extended for an additional term (Please see §15-602). 
Prior to the granting of an extension, the developer and/or owner understand and agree as follows: 
1.  The owner/developer will notify the administrator no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the letter of credit's term that the public improvements have not been completed and request an extension. 
2.  The granting of an extension for a term of an additional year may, at the commission's discretion, be granted administratively. The owner/developer may be required to submit a revised cost estimate and a proposed timeline for project completion. If a revised cost estimate is required, the sum of the letter of credit may be increased to guarantee the installation of all remaining improvements. 
3.  Letters of credit may not be extended cumulatively beyond twenty four (24) months. 
4.  When the extension of a letter of credit requires the issuing bank to provide an amended letter of credit, the amended letter of credit must be provided to the administrator no less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the original letter of credit's term. In the event that an amendment is provided less than ten (10) days prior to expiration and said delay results in the preparation or delivery of "failure to perform drafts" by the town, the owner/developer is responsible to reimburse the town for all costs associated with the preparation and/or delivery of drafts. 
Nothing herein shall be construed as a guarantee or inference that an extension of surety will be automatically granted after a one (1) year period as provided in the land development regulations or limit the ability of the town to declare the surety in default after the completion date specified in the original letter of credit. 
Request for Surety Reduction 
The commission or administrator may, at its discretion, grant reductions in the amount of a letter of credit to reflect progress by an owner/developer in installing required improvements. The owner/developer must provide requests for reduction no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of a letter of credit. Request for reduction may accompany the notification and request for extension as provided above. The owner/developer must provide cost estimates or documentation justifying the reduction (See §15-603). 
Notification of Improvement Completion and Request For Release 
Once all improvements covered by the letter of credit are installed and are accepted by the town or responsible agency, the administrator will release the letter of credit. The owner/developer is responsible for notifying the administrator of project completion and requesting acceptance of the improvements. Notification should be provided no less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the letter of credit. The acceptance of streets requires action by the commission and Surfside Beach Town Council. Notification of street completion and requests for acceptance should be submitted no less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the letter of credit. In the event that notification is provided less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration and said delay results in the preparation or delivery of "failure to perform drafts", the owner/developer is responsible to reimburse the town for all costs associated with the preparation and/or delivery of drafts. The letter of credit may not be released until the improvements are accepted, a warranty has been established for street improvements (where applicable), and the administrator provides written notification of completion and acceptance to the issuing bank. 
The Letter of Credit is Not a Waiver of Liability 
In the event of a failure to perform, default, or failure to extend a letter of credit, the town reserves the right to take all available legal and administrative actions necessary to compel the completion of the project by the owner/developer, to secure all necessary easements and rights of entry, and/or to recoup any public funds expended by the town or responsible agencies in the fulfillment of the owner/developer's obligation. 
Compliance Agreement 
I, ___________, as the owner/developer and the provider of the letter of credit have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the conditions as provided herein. I understand and agree that I have been advised that I may forego the requirement to provide a letter of credit by having the required public improvements installed and approved prior to the issuance of my building permit and/or the approval of my subdivision plat. I understand and agree that I have been advised that an alternate form of surety, the posting of a cash deposit, is available and that I have voluntarily elected to provide a letter of credit. I understand and agree that my failure to perform the required improvement or comply with the conditions as outlined herein will constitute a violation of the Land Development Regulations of the Town of Surfside Beach, South Carolina .

Prior to providing a cash deposit for my project, the cost estimates, as provided above, will be submitted to and approved by The Town of Surfside Beach Planning Commission ['commission'] or Development Administrator ['administrator'] as stipulated in the Land Development Regulations of the Town of Surfside Beach, South Carolina.

ARTICLE II. - ADMINISTRATION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 17-200. - Code enforcement official to administer and enforce. 
    The town council shall appoint the code enforcement official to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. The duties of the code enforcement official are to: 
(1)  Maintain permanent and current records of this chapter including, but not limited to, all zoning maps, amendments, special exceptions, variances, appeals, zoning permits, and applications thereof and records of hearings thereon. Such records shall be open to public inspection during business hours; 
(2)  Interpret zoning provisions and district boundaries; 
(3)  Provide such clerical, technical, and consultative assistance as may be required by the board of zoning appeals, planning commission, town council, and other boards, commissions, and officials in the exercise of duties relating to this chapter; 
(4)  Review, approve, and issue all administrative permits and determinations as authorized by this chapter and to maintain a record of these permits and determinations; 
(5)  Review, file, and forward to the board of zoning appeals the records and applications for all appeals, variances, and special exceptions; 
(6)  Review, file, and forward to the planning commission the records and applications for all zoning amendments; 
(7)  Investigate and resolve zoning violation complaints; 
(8)  Conduct inspections of structures, land, and the uses thereof to determine compliance with this chapter; and 
(9)  Perform all other duties as assigned by this chapter. 
Sec. 17-201. - Exceptions and modifications. 
(a)  Nonconforming lot. Where the owner of a lot consisting of one (1) or more adjacent lots of record at the time of adoption of this chapter does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the lot size, lot width, or frontage requirements of this chapter, such lot may nonetheless be used as a building site and the code enforcement official is authorized to issue a permit for the use of the property which conforms to the requirements for the district in which the lot is located as set forth in this chapter. In administering this provision, the code enforcement official may authorize the reduction of required yards or setbacks provided that such requirements are not reduced below the minimum specified in this chapter by more than twenty (20) percent. In the event that the code enforcement official fails to authorize such reduction or in cases where a reduction of more than twenty (20) percent is required, the board of zoning appeals may authorize the reduction of required yards or setbacks consistent with variance standards as imposed by this chapter. 
(b)  Front yards. The front yard requirements of this chapter for dwellings shall not apply to any lot where the average depth of existing front yards on developed lots, located within one hundred (100) feet on each side of such lot and within the same block and zoning district and fronting on the same street as such lot, is less than the minimum required front yard depth. In such case, the minimum front yard shall be the average of the existing front yard depths on the developed lots. 
(c)  Multiple buildings. In the case of a parcel of land consisting of at least one (1) acre, not located in the R-1 low density residential district or the R-2 medium density residential district, not subdivided into the customary streets and lots, and which will not be subdivided, or where the existing or contemplated street and lot layout make it impracticable to apply the requirements of section 17-404, a special exception to the terms of section 17-404 may be approved by the board of zoning appeals to allow more than one (1) principal building to be placed on the parcel or lot of land. 
(d)  Exceptions of height limits. Except as provided in this subsection, the height limitations as established by the individual zoning districts shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, and domes not intended for human occupancy, monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission towers, windmills, chimneys, smokestacks, derricks, conveyors, flag poles, radio towers, masts, aerials, amusement devices/structures, and elevator shafts. Where a height limitation for a specific structure or use is provided by this chapter, such height limitation shall supersede the height limitations imposed by any district requirement. In cases where a specific use or structure requirement is not provided by this chapter, the structures enumerated by this subsection may be constructed to a height not to exceed one and one-half (11/2) times the building height permitted by the zoning district. 
(e)  Nonconforming building enlargement. Where the principal building on a lot contains a conforming use and is nonconforming solely as a result of a setback encroachment, additions to the principal building can be allowed provided the new addition does not project into the setback. If a proposed addition would encroach into the same setback that already has been encroached upon, the addition can be allowed, provided that it projects no further into the setback than the existing building and in no way extends past the wall line of the existing building. This provision does not apply to a nonresidential use that adjoins a residential district on the side of the lot having the setback nonconformity. Neither shall this provision be applied to allow a building to be extended closer than five (5) feet from any property line nor allow a building to be extended closer than fifteen (15) feet from any publicly maintained right-of-way. 
Section 17-201(e) Illustration

g.  Any additional information as deemed pertinent by the applicant to justify the request for rezoning; and 
h.  An application fee, as established by ordinance, to cover administrative costs. 
Any communication purporting to be an application for an amendment shall be regarded as mere notice to seek relief until such request is made in the form required and an application fee has been paid. All applications for amendment shall be submitted to the code enforcement official for processing. The code enforcement official shall review the application as to proper form, and then shall submit all papers and other data tendered by the applicant to the planning commission for a public hearing, review, and recommendation to the town council. 
(3)  Public hearing scheduling; notice. A public hearing shall be scheduled by the planning commission to be held not more than forty-five (45) days after the filing of the amendment's application with the code enforcement official. For all proposed amendments, notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the scheduled public hearing date. Any person(s) or groups that have expressed in writing, to the planning department, an interest in being informed of zoning proceedings shall be mailed notice of such meeting not less than fifteen (15) days before the public hearing. 
In cases of a zoning map amendment, conspicuous notice shall be placed on or adjacent to the property affected, with at least one (1) such notice being visible from each public thoroughfare that abuts the property. The notice shall be posted at least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing. A letter of notification to each property owner within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the subject property shall be mailed by the code enforcement official no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing date. The letter shall contain information adequate to notify such owners and residents of the intention to rezone the area for which the application is submitted and when and where the public hearing will be held before the planning commission.

Any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. No member of the planning and zoning commission shall participate in a matter in which he has any pecuniary or special interest. 
(5)  Recommendation by the planning commission. The planning commission shall have thirty (30) days following the public hearing within which to submit its recommendation and report to the town council. The report submitted to the town council shall contain a summary of all significant issues or concerns presented at the public hearing.

a.  Whether or not the requested zoning change is consistent with the comprehensive plan or is justified by an error in the original ordinance; 
b.  The precedents and the possible effect of such precedents which might result from approval or denial of the application; 
c.  Whether the uses permitted by the proposed change would be appropriate in the area concerned; and 
d.  The capacity of the town or other government agencies to provide additional services, facilities, or infrastructure that might be required if the application was approved. 
If the planning commission fails to submit a recommendation within the thirty (30) day period, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval of the requested amendment. 
(6)  Action by the town council. The planning commission shall promptly transmit its recommendation to the town council. For each amendment request, the town council shall consider the recommendation of the planning commission; however, town council is not bound by the recommendation in making a final decision. All amendments, changes, or supplements to the zoning map or ordinance must be adopted by the town council as an ordinance in accordance with S.C. Code § 5-7-270. If a requested amendment is denied, such action shall be by resolution. If the town council fails to take action on a requested amendment within three hundred sixty-five (365) days of an application's public hearing, the requested amendment shall be deemed to have been rejected and no other action by the town council is required. 
(d)  Limitations on reapplication. Except for requests that are continued with the mutual consent of the applicant and the planning commission, a property owner or owners shall not initiate action for a zoning map amendment affecting the same parcel of property, or any part thereof, more often than once every twelve (12) months. 
(e)  Reversion. To prevent land speculation at the expense of the general public and to ensure the timing of projects in accord with stated development objectives, construction shall start on all rezoned property within six (6) months after rezoning. If construction is not begun within the specified time or is not completed within two (2) years, the planning commission shall review the zoning of the property and the progress which has taken place, and, if necessary, initiate proceedings to reclassify the zoning of the property in a manner consistent with the comprehensive plan. Any reclassification or reversion of zoning, which may be initiated by the planning commission, shall be considered a zoning map amendment and shall follow the amendment procedures of this section.

Sec. 17-204. - Application for zoning permit. 
(a)  Except as provided in article VI (signs) of this chapter, all applications for zoning permits shall be accompanied by plans in duplicate drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon; the exact sizes and locations on the lot of buildings already existing, if any, and the location and dimensions of the proposed building or alteration.

(b)  No nonconforming structure or use shall be maintained, renewed, changed, or extended until a certificate of zoning compliance shall have been issued by the code enforcement official. The certificate of zoning compliance shall state specifically wherein the nonconforming use differs from the provisions of this chapter, provided that upon enactment of amendment of this chapter owners or occupants of nonconforming uses or structures shall have three (3) months to apply for a certificate of zoning compliance.

(c)  When the code enforcement official created by this chapter is authorized to issue permits under the building code, the zoning permit or certificate of zoning compliance required by this chapter may be combined with or made part of the building permit or certificate of occupancy required by the building code. When combined, the permit and/or certificate shall clearly denote conformance with the requirements of this chapter and the building code. 
Sec. 17-208. - Conditional and temporary uses. 
(a)  Controls required.

DIVISION 2. - BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS 

Sec. 17-220. - Established; membership; term of office. 
    There is hereby created a board of zoning appeals to be composed of seven (7) members appointed by town council for terms of four (4) years pursuant to section 2-61. No member of the board of zoning appeals shall hold a public office or position in the town.

(1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter. 
(2)  To hear and decide appeals for variance from the requirements of this chapter when a strict application of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the board makes and explains in writing the following findings: 
a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property; and 
b.  These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity; and 
c.  Because of these conditions, the application of this chapter to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonable restrict the utilization of the property; and 
d.  The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance. 
1.  The board may not grant a variance, the effect of which would be to allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in a zoning district, to extend physically a nonconforming use of land or to change the zoning boundaries shown of the official zoning map. The fact that property may be utilized more profitably, if a variance is granted, may not be considered grounds for a variance. 
2.  In granting a variance, the board may attach to it such conditions regarding the location, character, or other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as the board may consider advisable to protect established property values in the surrounding area or to promote the public health, safety, or general welfare. 
(3)  To authorize the permitting of special exceptions subject to the terms and conditions for such uses as set forth by this chapter. The board of zoning appeals may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a request for a special exception permit. Special exception permits may be approved only if the board finds that the proposed use: 
a.  Is in fact a use specifically listed as a special exception for the zoning district in which the use is intended; and 
b.  Is consistent with the recommendations contained in the Surfside Beach Comprehensive Plan and the character of the underlying zoning district as indicated in the zoning district's "intent"; and 
c.  Is compatible with existing uses in the vicinity and will not adversely affect the general welfare or character of the immediate community; and 
d.  Adequate provision is made for such items as setbacks, buffering, and screening (including fences and/or landscaping) to protect adjacent properties; and 
e.  Will not result in nuisances or other adverse disturbances such as noise, odor, dust, vibrations, glare, overcrowding, or excessive traffic, in excess of what is anticipated for the zoning district or area; and 
f.  When applicable, will be developed in a way that will preserve and incorporate important natural features; and 
g.  Complies with all applicable rules, regulations, laws, and the standards of this chapter; and 
h.  Will not hinder or endanger vehicular traffic or pedestrian movements on adjacent streets. 
In granting a special exception permit, the board may attach to it such conditions regarding the location, character, or other features of the proposed structure or use as the board may consider advisable to protect established property values in the surrounding area or to promote the public health, safety, or general welfare. 
(4)  To remand a matter to the code enforcement official, upon motion by a party or the board's own motion, if the board determines that the record is insufficient for review. A party's motion for remand may be denied if the board determines that the record is sufficient for review. The board must set a rehearing on the remanded matter for a time certain within sixty (60) days unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The board must maintain a list of persons who expressed an interest in being informed when the remanded matter is set for rehearing, and notice of the rehearing must be mailed to these persons prior to the rehearing. 
In exercising the above powers, the board of zoning appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. The board, in the execution of the duties for which appointed, may subpoena witnesses and in case of contempt may certify such fact to the circuit court having jurisdiction. 
(5)  To hear and decide appeals to remove a landmark tree within the town. Criteria to be considered in determining whether removal of the landmark tree is warranted shall be as follows: 
a.  Size, and health of the tree; 
b.  Constraints for reasonable development of the site including location of primary structure and vehicle use areas, proposed grade changes, surface water drainage and utility installations; 
c.  Whether a hazard is presented to pedestrians or vehicle traffic; 
d.  Overall tree coverage and landscaping of the site (is it probable the tree's roots will cause damage to the primary structure in time; 
e.  Whether a hazard is presented to buildings or utility lines; 
f.  Whether the tree is damaged, diseased, dying or dead.

b.  Body piercing shall be permitted as an accessory use only inside state licensed health care establishments engaged in the science and art of preventing, curing or alleviating disease, including medical, surgical, psychiatric, chiropractic and osteopathic, and dental hospitals, clinics and offices; but excluding gymnasiums, health clubs, veterinary clinics, and associated uses.

Towers located on existing structures are preferred to construction of new towers; 
f.  The communication tower structures on individual lots must be located no closer to noncommercially zoned lots or residential areas than a distance equal to the height of the tower; 
g.  The proposed tower is only illuminated as required by the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Aviation Administration or other regulatory agencies. Night time strobe lighting shall not be incorporated unless required by the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Aviation Administration, or other regulatory agency; 
h.  The proposed tower shall not include signage of any nature on any portion of the tower, except for any necessary informational or warning signs related to the safe operation of the tower; and 
i.  A communication tower taken out of service must be removed within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date such tower ceases to be used for communication purposes and the site dismantled at the expense of the owner.

Secs. 17-428, 17-429. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 

Sec. 17-430. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this division is to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Surfside Beach, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent or reduce to any extent the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses in the town. The provisions of this division have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of or reasonable access to any communicative materials or expression. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials or expression protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this division to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscenity. 
    Due to the direct relationship between the consumption of alcoholic beverages and sexually oriented entertainment and an increase in criminal activities, moral degradation, and disturbances of the peace and good order of the community, and the congruency of these activities as hazardous to the health and safety of the community, the Town of Surfside Beach finds that it is necessary and advisable to regulate and restrict the conduct of owners, operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers, patrons, and persons on the premises of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. Specifically, it is the intent of the town to prohibit exposure of specified anatomical areas to public view, and any occurrence of specified sexual activity in establishments licensed to serve alcoholic beverages. 
Sec. 17-431. - Findings of fact. 
    Sexually oriented businesses generate secondary effects that are detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare. Such detriments have been documented in numerous studies including but not limited to: Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); Amarillo, Texas (1977); Garden Grove, California (1991); Los Angeles, California (1977); Whittier, California (1978); Austin Texas (1986); Seattle, Washington (1989); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); El Paso, Texas (1986); New York City, New York (1994); Dallas, Texas (1997); Newport News, Virginia (1996); New York Times Square Study (1994); Phoenix, Arizona (1995-1998); Greensboro, North Carolina (2003); Toledo, Ohio (2002); and, Centralia, Washington (2004). 
    Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial use, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, public safety risks, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit sexual activity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
    The location of sexually oriented businesses close to residential areas diminishes property values and leads to conditions that give rise to crime in residential neighborhoods. Studies performed in other communities, including the aforementioned, indicated conclusively that property crimes and sexual crimes increase significantly in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. 
    Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the town has a substantial governmental interest in preventing and/or abating in the future. The regulations contained in this division are designed to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to facilitate the enforcement of legitimate location and distance requirements.

Except as provided in this section, appeals to the board are to follow the procedures as provided in article II of this chapter.

ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 17-500. - Purpose. 
    It is the general policy of the Town of Surfside Beach to allow uses, structures, lots, and other situations that came into existence legally, in conformance with the then-applicable requirements, to continue to exist and to be put to productive use. Further, it is the policy of the town that as many aspects of the nonconformity be brought into compliance with the existing regulations as is reasonably possible. This article establishes regulations governing uses, structures, lots, signs, and other situations that were lawfully established but that do not comply with one (1) or more existing requirements of this chapter. The regulations of this article are intended to: 
(1)  Recognize the interests of property owners in continuing the use of their property; 
(2)  Promote reuse and rehabilitation of existing structures; and 
(3)  Place reasonable limits on the expansion or continuance of nonconformities that have the potential to adversely affect surrounding properties and the town as a whole. 
Sec. 17-501. - General nonconforming provisions. 
(a)  Continuance. Any use, lot, structure, or other property feature that legally existed prior to the adoption of this chapter, or that became nonconforming upon the adoption of any amendment to this chapter, may be continued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Determination of nonconformity status. The burden of establishing that a nonconformity is a legal nonconformity shall, in all cases, be solely upon the owner of such nonconformity. 
(c)  Repairs and maintenance. Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of nonconformities shall be permitted unless such repairs are otherwise prohibited by this article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition, in accordance with an official order of the code enforcement official or his/her designee. 
(d)  Change of tenancy or ownership. The status of a nonconformity is not affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management. 
Sec. 17-502. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Expansion. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded unless one (1) of the following conditions exists: 
(1)  Such expansion eliminates or reduces the nonconformity and such expansion or extension conforms to the provisions of this chapter; or 
(2)  The expansion is into a part of a building or structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such use, provided that no such expansion shall be allowed if it displaces a conforming use. 
(3)  Commercial uses located within the entertainment district (C-4) that are deemed to be nonconforming with the creation of the district and as of the date of the ordinance that is damaged by fire or any other cause shall be permitted to restore or reestablish the use or to establish any other use permitted in the entertainment district, using the same footprint, height and square footage as existed prior to the fire or other cause. Structures must comply with the current flood damage prevention ordinance and all other federal, state and local laws that are applicable. 
(b)  Change of use. A nonconforming use may not be changed to any use other than a use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located. 
(c)  Abandonment and loss of nonconforming status. If a nonconforming use is replaced with another use or is discontinued for any reason for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) days or longer, or one (1) year in the case of seasonal uses, the use shall be considered abandoned. Once abandoned, the use's legal nonconforming status shall be lost and the re-establishment of a nonconforming use shall be prohibited. Any subsequent use of the property shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(d)  Damage or destruction and loss of nonconforming status. 
(1)  Except for residential uses, a nonconforming use that is damaged by fire or any other cause shall not be restored or re-established if the cost of the repair work equals fifty (50) percent or more of the use's total physical replacement cost (which shall consist solely of materials and labor). Determinations of physical replacement costs shall be made by the code enforcement official. Where damage is less than fifty (50) percent and such repairs are permitted, they shall in no way increase the extent of the nonconformity (pre-damage) and shall otherwise be in full compliance with the regulations of this chapter. Authorized repairs shall be completed within twelve (12) months of such damage. 
(2)  A nonconforming residential use that is damaged by fire or any other cause may be restored. In such cases, the use may be re-established to the extent that existed before the time of damage, provided that the repairs or rebuilding do not increase the degree of nonconformity, do not increase the footprint and/or height of the damaged or destroyed building, and that the restoration or reconstruction begin within six (6) months and is completed within twelve (12) months of such damage. This section does not include residential uses in the entertainment district. Non-conforming residential uses within the entertainment district (C-4) shall not be permitted to be restored after fire or any other cause of damage exceeding forty-eight (48) percent of the value of the structure.

(c)  Moving or relocation. A nonconforming structure may be moved in whole or part to another location on the same lot if the movement or relocation does not increase the extent of nonconformity. A nonconforming structure may be moved to another lot provided that the dimensional and use requirements of the lot's underlying zoning district can be met. 
(d)  Damage or destruction and loss of legal nonconforming status. 
(1)  A nonconforming structure, other than a residential structure, that is damaged by fire or any other cause shall not be restored, except in conformity with the provision of this chapter, if the cost of the repair work equals fifty (50) percent or more of the structure's total physical replacement cost (which shall consist solely of materials and labor). Determinations of physical replacement costs shall be made by the code enforcement official. Where damage is less than fifty (50) percent and such repairs are permitted, they shall in no way increase the extent of the nonconformity (pre-damage) and shall otherwise be in full compliance with the regulations of this chapter. Authorized repairs shall be completed within twelve (12) months of such damage. 
(2)  A nonconforming residential structure that is damaged by fire or any other cause may be restored. In such cases, the structure may be re-established to the extent that existed before the time of damage, provided that the repairs or rebuilding do not increase the degree of nonconformity, do not increase the footprint and/or height of the damaged or destroyed building, and that the restoration or reconstruction begin within six (6) months and is completed within twelve (12) months of such damage. 
(3)  All construction authorized by this section shall conform to the requirements of the building code and Flood Prevention Ordinance (Chapter 14 of this Code). 
Sec. 17-504. - Nonconforming lots. 
(a)  Vacant lots. Nonconforming vacant lots may be occupied by a use allowed by the underlying zoning district, provided that the use shall comply with all applicable setbacks (see subsection 17-201(a). If the underlying zoning district permits a variety of uses or a variety of intensities and one (1) or more uses or intensities would comply with setback and other district standards, while others would not, then only the uses or intensities that would comply with the applicable district standards shall be permitted. 
(b)  Lot with building or structures. If a nonconforming lot contains a building or structure on the date on which this chapter becomes applicable to it, then the owner may continue the use of that building or structure and may reasonably expand the structure in a way that does not increase the degree of nonconformity. For buildings or structures occupied by a permitted use, an increase in the building size shall not be deemed to increase the degree of nonconformity unless it increases the encroachment on a required yard or, in the case of residential occupancy, increases the number of dwelling units on the nonconforming lot. 
Sec. 17-505. - Nonconforming features. 
    Except as may be provided elsewhere in this chapter, nonconforming features to include a deficiency in the number of required parking required illumination, or similar site appurtenance may continue pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 17-0838, adopted April 11, 2017, repealed the former Art. VI, §§ 17-600-17-654, and enacted a new Art. VI as set out herein. The former Art. VI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 11-0706, 8-23-11; Ord. No. 12-0713, 5-22-12; Ord. No. 12-0719, 7-25-12. 

DIVISION 1. - INTRODUCTORY SIGN PROVISIONS 

Sec. 17-600. - Legislative intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs to ensure that they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate, but not excessive, for their intended purpose. Any display of off-premises, outdoor advertising (billboards) is considered inappropriate to the character and proper development of the town, and it is intended by this article that such display shall not be permitted within the town. The provisions of this article are to establish reasonable and objective regulations for all signs within the town for the following purposes: 
(1)  Provide a pleasing overall environmental setting and good community appearance which is deemed vital to tourism and to the continued economic attractiveness of the town; 
(2)  To improve and foster pedestrian and motorist safety by minimizing distractions and obstructions that contribute to vehicular and other accidents; 
(3)  To avoid personal injury and property damage from structurally unsafe signs; 
(4)  To protect property values and private and public investment in property; 
(5)  Promote highway safety, the welfare and comfort of travelers, the convenience of the public, and the enjoyment of public travel. 
(Ord. No. 17-0838, 4-11-17) 
Sec. 17-601. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to the construction, erection, alteration, use, location, size and height of and the maintenance of all signs, regardless of their cost of construction. No reference in this article referring to sign copy or sign purpose shall be interpreted or applied to improperly regulate content or impair the right of free speech. 
(Ord. No. 17-0838, 4-11-17) 
Sec. 17-602. - Display of noncommercial messages/severability. 
    Any sign allowed under this article may contain, in lieu of any other copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message that does not direct attention to a business or to a commodity or service for sale, and that complies with all other requirements of this article. If any provision of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding must not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision. 
(Ord. No. 17-0838, 4-11-17; Ord. No. 17-0861, 1-9-18) 
Sec. 17-603. - Application of dimensional standards. 
(a)  Determining sign area. The entire face of a sign, including the advertising surface and any framing, trim, or molding but not including the supporting structure. In the case of back-to-back or V-shaped signs, the measurement will be based on only one (1) side of the sign. Both sides of a double-faced sign or V-type shall be of equal size. The sign area of signs with three (3) or more sides (multiple side signs) containing copy message, decoration or announcement visible from a street, highway or expressway is measured as the sum of the area of any two (2) adjacent sides. 
(b)  Determining the number of signs. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a single sign shall be considered to be a display surface or device containing elements organized, related, and composed to form a unit. Where matter is displayed in a random manner without an organized relationship of elements, each element shall be considered to be a sign. The two (2) components of back-to-back, double faced, or V-shaped signs shall be considered one (1) sign. 
(c)  Determining the height of signs. Sign height shall be determined from the finished grade at the base to the highest point of the sign including all supports.

ARTICLE VIII. - SHORE PROTECTION 

Sec. 17-800. - Legislative intent. 
    It is the intent of this article to protect public and private coastal property in the town from damage caused by flooding, erosion, and hurricanes as much as is reasonably possible. It is the further intent of this article to allow the reasonable use of coastal property that is subject to hurricanes, floods, and erosion while promoting public health and safety by protecting the natural beach and dune system from alterations that restrict its natural and dynamic changes or that impair its ability to provide a natural buffer from wind, water, and wave action. 
    The State of South Carolina has promulgated regulations, as administered through the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, that restrict and/or require permitting for certain activities along the beachfront. This article is designed to complement and, in some instances, provide protections in addition to those afforded in the state regulations. It is further intended that in the event a provision of this article is inconsistent with those of the state, the more restrictive provision shall control, to the extent allowed by law. 
Sec. 17-801. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Baseline shall mean the line established, within a standard erosion zone, at the location of the crest of the primary oceanfront sand dune in that zone. In a standard erosion zone in which the shoreline has been altered naturally or artificially by the construction of erosion control devices, groins, or other man-made alterations, the baselines must be established using the best scientific and historical data, as where the crest of the primary ocean front sand dune for that zone would be located if the shoreline had not been altered. 
    Base value shall mean the appraised value of a habitable structure as contained within the tax appraisal records of Horry County. The base value only includes the assessed value of the structure(s) on the lot and does not include the value of the land on which the structure(s) is situated. 
    Destroyed beyond repair shall mean, for habitable structures and pools, more than sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent of the replacement value of the habitable structure or pool has been destroyed. For seawalls, bulkheads, and other structures, destroyed beyond repair shall mean that more than fifty percent of the structure, above grade, has been destroyed. The percentage destroyed, for seawalls and bulkheads, is determined based on the length of the structure, parallel to the shoreline, after damage divided by the length of the same structure before damage. 
    Dune, sand shall mean a hill or ridge of loose, windblown sand with or without vegetation. 
    Habitable structure shall mean a structure suitable for human habitation including, but not limited to, single-family, two-family, or multifamily residences, hotels, condominium buildings, and buildings for commercial purposes. Each building of a condominium regime is considered a separate habitable structure, but if the building is divided into apartments, then the entire building, not the individual apartment is considered a single habitable structure. Additionally, a habitable structure includes porches, gazebos, and other attached improvements. 
    Primary ocean front sand dunes shall mean those dunes which constitute the front row of dunes adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean. 
    SCDHEC-OCRM shall mean the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management. 
    SCDHEC-OCRM setback area shall mean the area located between the setback line and the baseline. 
    SCDHEC-OCRM setback line shall mean the line landward of the baseline that is established at a distance which is forty (40) times the average annual erosion rate as determined by historical and other scientific means and is adopted by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control in the State Comprehensive Beach Management Plan. However, all setback lines shall be established no less than twenty (20) feet landward of the baseline, even in cases where the shoreline has been stable or experienced net accretion over the past forty (40) years. 
    Shore protection area (SPA) shall mean that area bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the shore protection line. 
    Shore protection line (SPL) shall mean a line seaward of which land and plants are protected under the provisions of this article. 
Sec. 17-802. - Shore protection line and area established. 
(a)  On all lots lying contiguous to the Atlantic Ocean, the shore protection line shall be determined to be the line twenty (20) linear feet landward of the property line nearest the Atlantic Ocean (rear property line) or the line twenty (20) linear feet landward of the crest of the primary ocean front sand dune, as determined by SCDHEC-OCRM, whichever such line is further from the Atlantic Ocean. The area bounded by the shore protection line, as determined in this subsection, and the Atlantic Ocean shall be known as the shore protection area. 
(b)  Prior to the issuance of a building or zoning permit for any new construction, development, or change of the primary use upon a lot lying contiguous to the Atlantic Ocean, and upon the determination by SCDHEC-OCRM that there is no continuous, identifiable primary ocean front sand dune situated upon or immediately seaward of such lot, the owner of such lot or the agent of such owner shall be required to construct a continuous, identifiable primary ocean front sand dune which shall be the same height and width and shall be in line with the adjacent primary ocean front sand dunes. Every primary ocean front sand dune which is required to be constructed by this subsection shall be composed of sand which is compatible in grain size with the sand which comprises adjacent primary ocean front sand dunes and every primary ocean front sand dune constructed pursuant to this section shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the permit issued for such construction by the code enforcement official. Upon completion of the construction of a continuous, identifiable primary ocean front sand dune in accordance with this subsection, a shore protection line shall be determined in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. Upon completion of construction of a continuous, identifiable primary ocean front sand dune in accordance with this subsection, property owners are encouraged to vegetate the dune with native plants in accordance with section 2.4.1 and Appendix F of the town's local comprehensive beach management plan. 
(c)  Notwithstanding anything contained in section 17-303, 17-310, 17-320, 17-330, 17-340, 17-348, 17-356, 17-362, or 17-386 to the contrary, all lots lying contiguous to the Atlantic Ocean upon which a shore protection line is established in accordance with subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to a fifteen-foot front yard setback requirement.

The dune crossing shall not be covered, and in no event shall the dune crossing be enclosed in any form on any side except by a safety guard rail. A dune crossing permitted by this section may be connected to the main building or structure situated upon a lot lying contiguous to the Atlantic Ocean by means of an elevated walkway. Elevated walkways shall be permitted by this section only as a means of access between a main building or structure and a dune crossing. Elevated walkways shall be built on pilings and must be constructed of wood planking elevated not less than two (2) feet above ground level. The boardwalk shall be no more than four (4) feet wide, leaving at least three-fourths (3/4) of an inch between each plank or board to permit partial transfer of sand, wind, rain, and sunlight.

(2)  Sand fence. Sand fencing configuration to protect and encourage the development of the primary ocean front sand dune for Surfside Beach incorporates a double row of fencing. The seaward row of fencing shall be placed along or on the seaward dune face and shall be maintained by the town. The landward row of sand fence shall be a continuous row of fencing placed along the shore protection line unless the town authorizes placement in a more seaward location; however the landward row of sand fence shall not be placed farther seaward than the landward trough of the ocean front sand dune. Every ocean front property owner shall install and maintain the row of sand fence on the landward side of the dune. Both the town and the property owner shall develop sand fencing in accordance with section 2.4.1 of the town's local comprehensive beach management plan. 
(3)  Vegetation. Property owners along the ocean front are encouraged to install and maintain native dune grasses, ground covers, and shrubs in the shore protection area. Vegetation on the seaward and landward sides of the primary ocean front sand dune shall be selected, installed, and maintained in accordance with section 2.4.1 and Appendix F of the town's local comprehensive beach management plan. The town may, at its discretion, allow property owners to landscape the area between the landward trough of the primary ocean front sand dune and the shore protection line with nonnative vegetation but not to include nonnative grass turf or covering. Nonnative vegetation shall not be allowed seaward of the landward through of the primary ocean front sand dune. The town may require mitigation for any landscaping seaward of the shore protection line using nonnative vegetation. Mitigation requirements are set forth in section 2.10 of the town's local comprehensive beach management plan. 
(4)  Emergency temporary erosion control. 
a.  In emergency situations, temporary erosion control measures including but not limited to sandbagging or sand scraping may be permitted for the protection of endangered improved real property. Only those temporary erosion control measures which do not impair the long term development and continuation of the natural dune system shall be permitted by this section. Permanent seawalls and/or other erosion control measures which impair or inhibit the development and continuation of the natural dune system are specifically prohibited by this article. All temporary erosion control measures must be removed within a reasonable time following the termination of the emergency situation.

Section 2. - [Rights, powers granted.] 
    The said grant, without in any way limiting its generality, shall include full rights, powers, privileges, easements, licenses and franchises to do any or all of the following acts: 
(a)  To place, construct, maintain, repair and alter poles, lamps, wires and wiring, guys, pipes, conduits, meters, transformers, and all other necessary, usual, convenient or incidental fixtures, machinery or equipment in, upon, along, across, under and over all present or future highways, roads, streets, avenues, boulevards, alleys, lanes, courts, driveways, traveled places, squares, parks and public places of every character and description within the present or future corporate limits of said town; and to extend, alter, repair, remove and relocate the same from time to time as in the judgment of the said South Carolina Public Service Authority may be necessary, convenient or expedient for the purpose of furnishing electricity within or without said town, but all use of said public places shall be conducted with due regard for the primary public purpose of said places. 
New facilities are defined as those which bring electrical power to areas, communities, businesses, or residences of the Town of Surfside Beach, which hitherto had not been served; conversation shall be defined as the placing below ground of existing overhead electric utility lines or replacement of transmission structures with more aesthetically pleasing structures. 
All new facilities constructed shall be underground facilities, except in the following cases: 
1.  Repair of overhead facilities which restores functional ability after injury or damage, relocations, replacements of rotted timber, rusted metal or line too small to carry the required load, and upgrades of existing overhead lines and poles; 
2.  Temporary emergencies, lasting no more than three hundred fifty-six (356) days, after natural or manmade disasters; exceptions may be granted by the Town Council; 
3.  Temporary lines for construction power where the temporary lines shall be removed within one hundred twenty (120) days of completion of the construction activities which required power; 
4.  Minor overhead line extensions constructed in existing overhead areas provided such extensions are no more than five hundred (500) feet; overhead line extensions more than five hundred (500) feet will be allowed along or across undeveloped property until there is an approved development plan, and need for power.

    In determining the amounts of revenue received by the authority, there shall first be deducted all sums paid by the Town for municipal water and sewer pumping service, municipal street lighting service, traffic signal service, and all taxes which are or may be imposed on the Authority by all lawful taxing bodies by reason of such sales. 
(Ord. of 4-19-83, § 1; Ord. No. 05-0561, § B, 6-14-05) 
Section 4. - [Indemnity of town.] 
    To the extent permitted by law, the South Carolina Public Service Authority, its successors and assigns, shall hold the said town harmless from any actions, suits, claims or demands by any person, firm or corporation arising out of the exercise of any rights, privileges and franchises herein conferred. 
Section 5. - [Effective date; term.] 
    This section and franchise shall take effect on July 1, 2005, and all the rights, powers, privileges, easements, licenses, and franchises herein conferred and granted shall be nonexclusive and shall be for a term of thirty (30) years from the effective date hereof, and expire on June 30, 2035, and further, that the aforesaid Ordinance Number 75-0060, adopted June 24, 1975, and subsequent amendments, is hereby renewed for an additional term of thirty (30) years concurrent with this section, and the terms and conditions thereof shall be in full force and effect, unless otherwise amended. 
(Ord. No. 05-0561, § C, 6-14-05) 
Section 5-A. - [Extension of franchise.] 
    This franchise shall be extended for thirty (30) years to continue until June 30, 2035, upon the establishment of a fund to which both the Town and the Authority shall annually make matching payments based on the franchise fees paid. After passage of this agreement, the Authority shall pay to the fund the amount of forty thousand five hundred thirty-eight dollars and fifty cents ($40,538.50) as its matching payment for the last half of the calendar year 2004. Thereafter, the fund shall be sustained with deposits by the Town, which equals forty (40) percent of the franchise fees received by the Town; each year such deposits shall be matched by an equal deposit to the fund by the Authority. 
    With the consent of Town Council, the Authority shall act with due diligence as steward of the fund, and shall oversee the establishment, accounting, and disbursements of, and from the fund. Simple interest at the rate then currently paid by the Authority on customer deposits will be paid annually on the amount contributed by the Town from the franchise fees. An accounting of the fund amount will be provided to the Town during January and July of each year or at any time the Town requests an accounting. 
    This fund will be used solely for underground construction or conversion projects within the Town of Surfside Beach as a cooperative endeavor between the Town and the Authority. A project includes all costs of materials and labor associated with the project, including sidewalk and street construction expenses, rights-of-way acquisition costs, and service drop installation costs, as well as design costs. The Authority and the Town may cooperate in strategic planning with regards to projects. However, at the Town's sole discretion, the Town shall prioritize projects to be undertaken. The Town shall notify the Authority of any underground construction or conversion projects it wishes to have undertaken. The Authority shall complete the projects with due diligence. 
    The Town may use the fund at any time it desires for underground power projects and rebuilding of overhead transmission lines in a way that would be more aesthetically pleasing to the Town. The Town may choose a project which exceeds the annual revenue by up to three (3) times. The next project will be delayed until the cost of the previous project has been paid. If a project exceeds the three-year fund projections, the interest rate for the portion exceeding the three-year amount will be at the Authority's average system debt. 
    At the end of the term of this agreement, the Town and the Authority will true up any amounts owing or any amounts remaining in connection with the fund. If the Town owes the fund, it will make payment to the Authority for the Authority's portion of the fund. If amounts remain in the fund, the Authority will make payment to the Town for the Town's portion of the fund. 
    Project and construction management shall be provided by the Authority without cost. The Authority will in some cases make certain credits, if a required overhead relocation project is chosen as an underground project, and the project is on a right-of-way that was first owned and occupied by the Town or the State. The Authority will credit the project for the cost of the required overhead relocation so the Town will only pay the difference in the cost of the overhead relocation and the cost of placing the lines underground. The Authority will not make this type of credit, if the project is on an Authority right-of-way, or if the project is on a right-of-way which was first occupied by the Authority. 
(Ord. No. 05-0561, § D, 6-14-05) 
Section 6. - [Copy of ordinance to be delivered to South Carolina Public Service Authority.] 
    A signed, certified and sealed copy of this ordinance shall be delivered to the South Carolina Public Service Authority and shall constitute a valid and binding franchise and agreement between the Town of Surfside Beach, South Carolina, and the South Carolina Public Service Authority, its successors and assigns. 
Section 7. - [Town's right to require inspection of service.] 
    The Town of Surfside Beach reserves the right to require an inspection on all electrical service, old or new, before power can be connected or reconnected. 
Done and ratified in Council assembled this 24th day of June, 1975.

This provision shall not affect any impact fees that may be required by GSWSA for any new services provided to former Surfside customers after the transfer date. 
(f)  Charges for connections in Surfside. GSWSA agrees that it will connect new customers inside the incorporated limits of Surfside at the prevailing connection fees of GSWSA for lines if the distance required for the connection line is not greater than two hundred (200) feet. If a connection can feasibly be made at a distance in excess of two hundred (200) feet by means of a service line, then the charge for connection will be based on the additional cost for the service line in excess of two hundred (200) feet. However, if the connection is more than two hundred (200) feet distant from an existing line and requires the extension of the main line, GSWSA may charge for all the cost of the extension of the main line in addition to any other appropriate charges. 
(g)  Surfside representation on advisory committee. GSWSA shall appoint a resident of Surfside to its advisory committee as soon as practicable after the transfer date. 
(h)  Water service to Surfside. GSWSA shall treat Surfside as a retail customer for all water provided to facilities owned and operated by Surfside. GSWSA shall provide Surfside with a single bill for all such services regardless of the number of locations served and the rates for service shall be the rate charged by GSWSA to other retail customers. Upon request by Surfside any portion of the water service for water only (such as irrigation purposes or outside showers at the beaches) may be separately metered and there will be no sewer charges for separately metered water service for irrigation. 
(i)  Fire department special services. GSWSA shall provide the Surfside fire department with water without charge for purposes of fighting fires, routine flushing of fire hydrants and flow testing. Surfside agrees that its fire department shall notify GSWSA immediately of any activities for which free water service is being provided hereunder. 
(j)  Guarantee of fire flows. GSWSA hereby guarantees to Surfside that the flows available for firefighting purposes shall not be less than those in existence as of the transfer date. 
(k)  Insurance. To the extent that Surfside is determined to have an insurable interest therein, GSWSA shall provide for Surfside to be shown as a coinsured on all property acquired by GSWSA under the terms hereof. 
(l)  Work in streets and rights-of-way. GSWSA will notify Surfside whenever its construction or maintenance activities require the interruption of normal traffic, either by construction that requires pavement to be cut or where work in the rights-of-way is expected to interfere with traffic. In the case of scheduled work and maintenance, GSWSA will obtain an encroachment permit from Surfside; provided that no permit need be obtained for emergency work. Upon completion of any such work, GSWSA will restore the pavement to its condition prior to any cutting or other interference. GSWSA will be responsible for any damages to persons or property resulting from its activities in the streets and rights-of-way of Surfside. GSWSA agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Surfside from any all liability resulting from GSWSA's activities in streets or rights-of-way. 
(m)  Town logo on water tanks. The logo or town name of Surfside may remain on all water tanks; provided that upon any refinishing or painting, Surfside shall be responsible for all cost relating to such logo or name. 
Section 3. - Condemnation. 
    Surfside and GSWSA acknowledge that it may become necessary from time to time to exercise the power of condemnation to provide for the continuation or improvement of the waterworks and sewer system. In such event, Surfside agrees to cooperate with GSWSA to pursue condemnation, including, upon request, being the moving party in pursuit thereof; provided, however, that all costs and expenses of any such proceeding shall be borne by GSWSA. 
DIVISION 6. - TERMINATION AND DEFAULT 

Section 1. - Termination. 
    In the event the referendum is unsuccessful, this agreement shall be terminated immediately. All costs incurred by either party shall be borne by it and neither party shall have any claim on the other in connection with the subject matter hereof. 
Section 2. - Termination of franchise. 
    Upon the termination of the franchise rights provided herein, Surfside shall purchase all of the assets of GSWSA then being used to provide distribution of water and collection and disposal of wastewater for the residents of Surfside. The purchase price for such purchase shall be determined by agreement of the parties; provided that such purchase price shall be based only on additions to the Surfside System from and after the transfer date and Surfside shall not be required to pay any compensation for the assets being transferred hereunder for the distribution of water and collection and disposal of wastewater assets. If the parties are unable to agree, then the purchase price shall be established as the average of the appraisals made by three (3) different appraisers, on appointed by each of the parties and the third by the two (2) so appointed. This provision does not govern any purchase or acquisition by Surfside from GSWSA of capacity in any treatment plants or disposal capacity. 
Section 3. - Default. 
    In the event either party discovers a [sic] that any representation is untrue in any material respect or any warranty is breached in any material respect, the cost of correcting any problem resulting therefrom or estimate based thereon shall be borne by the party whose representation is untrue or whose warranty is breached. 
    In the event either party fails to timely perform its obligations hereunder, the other party may initiate action to compel compliance in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of such action shall be recoverable from the defaulting party.

Section 3. - Effect of dissolution of a party. 
    In the event either GSWSA or Surfside for any reason shall be dissolved or its legal existence shall otherwise be terminated, all of the covenants, stipulations, obligations and agreements contained in this agreement by or on behalf of or for the benefit of such party shall bind or inure to the benefit of the successor or successors thereof from time to time and any officer, board, commission, authority, agency or instrumentality to whom or which any power or duty affecting such covenants, stipulations, obligations and agreements shall be transferred by or in accordance with law, and the term GSWSA or Surfside, as the case may be, when used in this agreement shall include such successor or successors. 
Section 4. - Legal holidays. 
    In any case where the date of any action required hereunder shall be on a day on which is a legal holiday in the State of South Carolina, performance shall be deemed timely if made on the next succeeding day which is not such a legal holiday with the same force and effect as if such act were performed on the date otherwise provided for herein.
